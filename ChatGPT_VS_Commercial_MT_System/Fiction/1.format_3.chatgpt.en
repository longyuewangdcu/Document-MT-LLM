The gale blew through the canyon, causing waves on the grassland.  The wild ox, who was eating the tender grass leaves, raised its head and looked up at the sky.  There, a wooden merchant ship several dozen meters long was hovering in the air, its full sails swelling with the wind and slowly moving forward.  "No matter when you look at it, the wind is always so spectacular,"  said the middle-aged man in leather armor, standing by the deck and gazing down at the endless grassland and scenery.  "For us merchants, it's also a rare business opportunity,"  said the slightly obese merchant standing next to the middle-aged man. He had a strange curly hair and was wearing a merchant's long robe. His small eyes were slightly squinted, as if he was calculating something, looking at the scenery in front of him. It seemed that even the beautiful scene in front of him could be sold for money.  "If it wasn't for it, I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to transport our goods into the central area so quickly," said the middle-aged man.  "To be honest, when I originally planned to expand this market, I was opposed, but now it seems that my choice was correct."  "But please excuse me for speaking frankly, you didn't choose a large navigation channel, but instead went from here. Although it will save time, the level of danger will also increase," said the slightly obese merchant. "I heard that things on the other side aren't peaceful lately. And, I think the captain also warned you, there seem to be wind snakes around here lately, just in case...‚Äù  The man's face became somewhat serious, he turned his head and cast his gaze toward the mountains not far away.  The towering peaks blocked his view, and he couldn't see what was behind them.  But vaguely, he could see that the sky in the distance was not pure blue, but with a hint of dark gloom.  That wasn't the world they should delve into.  "Don't worry, there are so many 'just in case' scenarios, wealth and danger go hand in hand, that's why I paid so much to hire you guys!"  "Just a few snakes, right?"  The merchant reached out and patted the man's shoulder.  "By the way, how is the young man we rescued doing now?"  "He hasn't died yet." "Lijie has already bandaged his wounds and he is now unconscious. He should not be in any life-threatening danger."  "That's good,"  the man replied, and the merchant nodded in satisfaction, but then he quickly furrowed his brow.  "But what exactly did that young man get hurt from? Judging from the wound, it looks like a big lizard - but do they have such strange things in the northern parts of Pfirrd?"  "I'm not sure, sir, but I think it must have been a very ferocious beast. I hope we don't run into one." As he spoke, the man unconsciously glanced at the entrance of the cabin and then turned his head forward again.  Rod opened his eyes.  What happened?  He gazed blankly at the ceiling in front of him, his mind dazed.  He remembered leading his team to fight against the most powerful boss in the dragon soul mainland, the Void Dragon, on the ruins of the high tower and successfully getting the first kill. He was sure he had received achievements and system prompts, but then the Void Dragon's final blow also took his life. According to the original plan, Rod should have resurrected in the cemetery and logged out.  But at the moment he was killed by the Void Dragon, the whole world immediately turned black as if it had been isolated. Then, Rod lost consciousness.  How could this be possible?  Has there been any problem with the game?  Rod turned his head with difficulty and could see the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. Where is he?  What is this place?  What happened?  Is he still dreaming?  Or is he still in the game?  At least, Rod can be sure that the place he is in now is definitely not his narrow rental apartment. When he thought of this, doubt immediately surged into Rodney's mind. He frowned and then tried to sit up.  "Ugh!!!"  And just then, a huge pain suddenly came from Rodney's chest. He bit his teeth and stopped moving. At this time, Rodney realized that his left shoulder and chest were completely wrapped in bandages.  Although he did not know what had happened, the bloodstains that were seeping through clearly showed that he was not lightly injured.  This was definitely not a game!  Rodney could be sure of this. After all, technology is now quite developed, and as the world's first virtual global network game, Dragon Soul Land also uses many high-tech technologies. However, according to the rules, players cannot experience pain. This is to differentiate reality from the game and also to consider reducing the threshold for players.  When a player is injured, the game will use methods such as reducing the player's action speed, using a red color to block the view as a warning and reminder, instead of simulating pain, instead of pain.  This behavior caused quite a bit of controversy when holographic simulation technology first appeared in society. The operating company of Dragon Soul Land naturally knows this.  Rodney lowered his head and looked at his right hand, which was not the character he had created in the game, not the body full of muscles and wildness.  On the contrary, the arm in front of him was thin and weak, and because it was not exposed to the sun for a long time, the skin was pale and unhealthy. This is his own body in reality, and he is very clear about this.  However, how could he be injured?  And, this place doesn't look like a hospital?  Rod raised his head and looked around, the whole room looked like a cabin, with no lights, no phone, and no call bell.  A wooden table, two chairs and a cabinet fixed to the wall are the only furnishings here.  For some reason, Rod felt that he had seen this scene somewhere before.  And just as Rod was looking around the room carefully, the door suddenly opened.  A blonde girl in a white robe walked into the room and looked at Rod, who was sitting up half way, with some surprise in her wide open eyes.  "You're awake? Great!!",  she said, not in Chinese or English, but Rod could clearly understand what she was saying. This surprised Rod and he knew the language.  It was Nime language, one of the official languages of the Dragon Soul mainland!  "How do you feel? Are you okay?"  But the girl didn't pay attention to Rod's expression. She quickly walked to Rod's side and carefully examined his left shoulder and chest.  "Your injury is really serious. To be honest, I was worried about whether you could hold on..."  "This is... " Rod frowned, but he didn't know what to say. He turned his head and looked at the mirror on the wall next to him. His face was clearly reflected there, and it was indeed his face, but it shouldn't be here.  "Did you forget?"  The golden-haired girl blinked her eyes with some doubts, and her two ponytails swayed slightly with her movements. Her blue eyes were clear and transparent, giving a lively feeling.  "Two days ago, you fell in the Pafield Mountain Range and suffered a serious injury." "If it wasn't for the shipment of the 'Silver Balance' Trade Association, it would have been quite bad."  "I really don't know what you're fighting against, your left body has been seriously injured, that was really dangerous."  Wait, left shoulder?  Rod was stunned, he immediately remembered that he was attacked on the left side during the final battle with the Void Dragon,  but that was the injury of his character in the game and it should not have anything to do with the player himself, but now the injury is to himself?  Although the situation in front of him is chaotic, Rod quickly calmed down, this is his psychological quality as a top player and the president of the world's strongest online gaming guild.  In his conversation with the blonde girl in front of him, Rod also learned about his current situation. He was seriously injured and lying on the Paphield Plain, and the Silver Balance Trade Association's airship just happened to pass by and saved him.  According to the blonde girl, Rod's initial situation was not optimistic, but his recovery ability was quite good.  "My name is Lijie. Nuoyalu, I am a member of the Star Moon mercenary group, a spiritualist, you can call me Lijie."  The girl introduced herself to Rod in a friendly manner. "My name is Rodd. Ailant."  Although he couldn't organize the situation in front of him yet, Rodd hesitated for a moment and still reported his identity and ID in the game.  "From the Eastern Mountain Plains, I am an adventurer."  "Adventurer, so that's why you are alone in such a remote mountain."  Hearing Rodd's answer, Lijie was not surprised, because on this continent, many adventurers like to explore alone, so Rodd's identity was not a big problem.  "But what are you fighting against?"  "Why were you injured so severely?"  "I remember that there shouldn't be anything particularly frightening in this plain area."  Hearing the girl's questions, Rodd hesitated and smiled.  What could he say? Could he tell Lijie that he was injured while fighting the Void Dragon, one of the five creation dragons? "Because I was attacked at night, I didn't see what the other party was exactly, they were many and fast, I think maybe they're from 'the other side.'"  "I understand."  Although Rod didn't explain in detail, Li Jie seemed to understand something and nodded her head, then she carefully checked Rod's wound before standing up.  "You haven't eaten for two days, I think you must be very hungry, please wait, I will go get some food right now."  "Oh, right, I also need to report this to the leader, I think he will come to see you soon."  After saying this, the girl politely nodded to Rod and then turned and left the room.
