A strong wind blew through the canyon, stirring up waves on the grassland. The wild buffalo, which had been grazing on tender grass leaves, raised its head to look at the sky. There, a wooden merchant ship several dozen meters long was hovering in the air, its sails billowing in the wind, moving slowly forward. "No matter when I see it, this spectacle of wind is always so magnificent," said a middle-aged man in leather armor standing by the deck, looking down at the endless grassland and beautiful scenery. "For us merchants, this is also a rare business opportunity." Standing next to the middle-aged man was a slightly chubby merchant with curly hair, wearing a merchant's robe. His small eyes squinted as if calculating something, gazing at the scenery before him. It seemed as if even this beautiful scene could be sold for money. "If it weren't for this, I'm afraid we wouldn't have been able to transport our goods to the central region so quickly." "To be honest, when I first planned to expand into this market, I faced opposition. But now, it seems that my choice was indeed correct." "However, if I may speak frankly, you chose not to use the large shipping routes but to go through here instead. Although it saves time, the level of danger also increases." "I heard that things have been quite unsettled on the other side recently. And, I think you've also been warned by the captain that there have been wind snakes spotted in this area lately. What if..." The man's expression turned somewhat solemn as he turned his head and cast his gaze towards the mountain range not far away. The towering peaks blocked his view, making it impossible to see what lay behind them. However, he could faintly see that the distant sky was not pure azure blue but tinged with a touch of gloomy darkness. That was not a world they should venture into. "Don't worry, there aren't that many 'what ifs.' Fortune favors the bold, and that's why I've spent so much money hiring you!" "It's just a few snakes, isn't it?" The merchant reached out and patted the man's shoulder. "By the way, how is the young man we saved doing now?" "He hasn't died yet." "Lydia has already dressed his wounds, and now he's in a deep sleep. There shouldn't be any danger to his life." "That's good." Hearing the man's response, the merchant nodded in satisfaction but soon furrowed his brows. "However, what kind of injury did the young man sustain? Judging from the wound, it looks like it was caused by a large lizardâ€”But are there such strange creatures in the northern part of Pafeld?" "I'm not sure, sir. But it must have been a very ferocious beast. Let's just hope we don't run into one." As he spoke, the man subconsciously glanced at the entrance to the cabin, then turned his gaze forward again. Rode opened his eyes. What had happened? He stared blankly at the ceiling above him, his mind foggy. He remembered leading his team in battle against the most powerful boss in Dragon Soul Continent, the Void Dragon, on the ruins' high platform. They had successfully achieved the first kill, and he was sure he had received the achievement and system notification. Then, the Void Dragon's final blow had taken his life. Originally, according to the plan, Rode should have respawned in the graveyard and then logged out. But the moment he was killed by the Void Dragon, the entire world turned pitch black, as if forcibly isolated. Then, Rode lost consciousness. How could this be? Could there be a problem with the game? Struggling to turn his head, Rode could see the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. Where was he? What place was this? What on earth had happened? Was he still dreaming, or was he still in the game? At least Rode could be sure that the place he was in now was definitely not his small rented apartment. Thinking of this, doubt immediately flooded Rode's mind. He furrowed his brows and tried to sit up. "Ouch!" At that moment, a sharp pain suddenly came from his chest, and he clenched his teeth, stopping his movement. It was then that Rode noticed that his left shoulder and chest were completely wrapped in bandages. Although he didn't know what had happened, judging by the bloodstains seeping through the bandages, his injuries were evidently severe. This was definitely not a game! Rode was sure of this. Although technology was quite advanced now, and Dragon Soul Continent, the world's first virtual reality MMORPG, made use of many high-tech techniques, according to the rules, players were not supposed to feel pain. This was to distinguish reality from the game and also to lower the entry barrier for players. Instead of pain, when a player was injured, the game would use methods such as reducing their movement speed and obstructing their vision with a red hue to warn and remind them, rather than simulating actual pain. This kind of behavior had sparked considerable debate in society when holographic simulation technology first appeared, and the operating company of Dragon Soul Continent would naturally be aware of this. Rode lowered his gaze, staring at his right hand. It was not the character he had created in the game, not the body full of muscles and wildness. Instead, the arm in front of him was slender and weak, and the skin was somewhat morbidly pale due to a lack of sunlight exposure for many years. This was his body in reality, and he was well aware of that. But how did he get injured? And this place didn't seem like a hospital. Rode looked up, and the entire room seemed to be a cabin. There were no lights, no telephone, and no call bell. A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed to the wall were all the room had. For some reason, Rode felt as if he had seen this scene somewhere before. And as Rode carefully examined the room, the door suddenly opened. A blonde girl in a white robe entered the room. She looked at Rode, who was half-sitting up, and widened her eyes in surprise. "You're awake? That's great!" The girl's words were neither in Chinese nor English, but Rode could clearly understand what she was saying. This surprised Rode a bit, as he knew this language. It was Nimmian, one of the official languages of Dragon Soul Continent! "How do you feel? Are you alright?" But the girl didn't pay attention to Rode's expression. She quickly walked to his side and carefully examined his left shoulder and chest. "Your injuries are quite severe. Frankly, I was worried whether you could make it or not..." "What is this...?" Rode furrowed his brow, not knowing what to say. He turned his head and looked at the mirror on the wall next to him. It clearly reflected his face, which was undoubtedly his, but it shouldn't be here. "Have you forgotten?" The blonde girl blinked her eyes with a puzzled look. Her twin ponytails swayed slightly as she moved. Her bright blue eyes were clear and transparent, giving a lively impression. "Two days ago, you were found in the Pafeld Mountains, seriously injured." "If it weren't for the Silver Scales Merchant Association's cargo ship passing by, the situation would have been quite bad." "I don't know what you were fighting, but your left side suffered severe damage. It was very dangerous at that time." Wait, left shoulder? Rode was stunned for a moment, and he immediately remembered that during his battle with the Void Dragon, his left side was attacked. But that was his character in the game who got injured, and it should have nothing to do with the player himself, right? However, now he himself is the one injured. Although the situation in front of him was chaotic, Rode quickly calmed down. This was the psychological quality of a top player and the president of the world's most powerful online gaming guild. Through his conversation with the blonde girl, Rode learned about his current situation: he was found severely injured in the Pafeld Plains, and the Silver Scales Merchant Association's airship happened to pass by and saved him. According to the blonde girl, Rode's initial condition was grim, but his recovery ability was quite remarkable. "My name is Lijie Noelle, a member of the Star and Moon Mercenary Corps and a spirit master. You can call me Lijie." The girl confidently introduced herself to Rode. "My name is Rode Alante." Although he still couldn't sort out the current situation, Rode hesitated for a moment and then gave his in-game identity and ID. "I come from the Eastern Plains and am an adventurer." "Ah, an adventurer, that makes sense. That's why you were alone in such a remote, deep mountain." Upon hearing Rode's answer, Lijie was not surprised. On this continent, many adventurers like to explore on their own, so Rode's identity didn't pose any significant problems. "But, what were you fighting?" "Why did you get such severe injuries?" "As far as I know, there shouldn't be any particularly terrifying monsters in this plain area." Hearing the girl's questions, Rode gave a somewhat embarrassed smile. What could he say? Should he tell Lijie that he was injured while fighting one of the so-called Five Creator Dragons, the Void Dragon? "Since I was attacked at night, I couldn't see clearly what they were. There were many of them, and they were fast. I think they might be creatures from 'over there'." "I see." Although Rode didn't explain in detail, Lijie seemed to understand and nodded. After carefully examining Rode's injuries, she stood up. "You haven't eaten for two days, so you must be very hungry. Please wait, I'll get you some food right away." "Oh, and I need to report this to the Captain. I think he'll come to see you soon." After saying this, the girl politely nodded to Rode and then left the room.
