The wind blew across the canyon, sending ripples across the grassland. The bison that was bending its head to nibble on the green grass raised its head and looked to the sky. There, a dozens of meters long wooden merchant ship is suspended in the air, full of sails in the wind blowing toward the bulge, moving forward slowly. "No matter what time of day you look, this wind tide is so spectacular." The middle-aged man in leather armor was standing by the deck, looking down on the endless grassland and beauty. "For us merchants, this is also a rare business opportunity." Standing beside the middle-aged man, is a slightly obese merchant, he has an odd curly hair, wearing a merchant's robe, two small eyes slightly narrowed, live as if calculating what to gaze at the scenery in front of him, look at his look, as if even this beautiful scenery in front of him, can be taken to sell money. "Without it, I'm afraid we wouldn't have been able to get the goods into the central region so quickly." "To be honest, I had been opposed when I first planned to expand this market, but now it seems that I did make the right choice." "However, with all due respect, you did not choose a large shipping route, but instead went through here, which would have saved time, but also increased the level of danger." "I heard that recently the other side is not peaceful ah. And, I think you've heard the captain warn that there seem to be wind snakes around here lately, in case ........." The man's face turned a bit gloomy as he turned his head and cast his eyes towards the mountains not far away. The towering peaks blocked his view and he couldn't see what it was like behind him. But one can vaguely see that the sky in the distance is not blue and pure, but with a touch of gloomy darkness. That was not the world they should have ventured into. "Don't worry, there are so many what-ifs, the rich and powerful, that's why I paid so much to hire you!" "A mere few snakes, isn't it?" The businessman reached out his hand and patted the man's shoulder. "By the way, how is the young man we saved now?" "Not dead yet, I guess." "Lige has bandaged his wounds, and now he is sleeping, so there should be no danger to his life." "That's good." Hearing the man's answer, the merchant nodded in satisfaction, but then he quickly frowned. "But what kind of injury did that young man receive, anyway? From that wound, it looks very much like a large lizard - but are there such odd things in northern Parfield?" "I'm not sure, my lord, but I think it should be a very fierce beast, so I hope we won't run into it." Saying that, the man subconsciously swept a glance at the entrance of the cabin, and then he turned his head again and looked ahead. Rod opened his eyes. What had happened? He gazed blankly at the ceiling in front of him, his brain was dizzy. He remembered that he should have led his team to fight the most powerful boss among the Dragon Soul Continent, the Void Dragon, on the ruined high platform earlier and managed to get the first kill, he was sure that he got the achievement and system prompt, and then the Void Dragon's last strike took his life. Originally, according to the original plan, Rod should have resurrected in the graveyard and logged out offline. But the moment he was killed by the Void Dragon, the entire world immediately turned black, as if he was forcibly isolated, and then, Rod lost consciousness. How is this possible? Could it be that there was something wrong with the game? Rod could barely turn his head and could see the blue sky and white clouds outside from the window, where was he? What is this place? What exactly happened? Was he still dreaming? Or is he still in the game? At least Rod can be sure that this place is definitely not his own small rental apartment. Thinking about it, doubt immediately rushed to Rod's mind and he frowned, then tried to sit up. "Woo!!!" And at that moment, a huge pain suddenly came from Rod's chest, and he gritted his teeth and stopped moving. And it was then that Rod realized that his left shoulder and chest, had been completely wrapped in bandages, and although he didn't know what had happened, it was clear that he was badly injured from the spots of blood that were seeping through there. This is definitely not a game! Rod can be sure of this, to know that although technology has now been quite developed, and as the world's first virtual full online game of the Dragon Soul Continent also has the use of many high-tech technology. But according to the rules, the player is impossible to experience pain, which is to allow people to distinguish reality from the game, but also to reduce the threshold of the player's consideration. And when the player is injured, instead of pain, the game will use to reduce the player's speed of action, with a series of red on behalf of critical to block the line of sight and other ways to interfere with the player's normal game of warning and reminder, rather than the real simulation of pain to. This kind of behavior had caused considerable controversy in society when holographic simulation technology first appeared, and naturally the company operating the Dragon Soul Continent could not have been unaware of this. Rod lowered his head and gazed at his right hand, which was not the character he had portrayed in the game, not the body full of muscles and wildness. On the contrary, the arm in front of him was slim and thin, and the skin was somewhat sickly pale because it hadn't been exposed to the sun for years. This is the reality of his own body, and he knows this very well. But, how did he get injured? Also, this didn't look like a hospital, right? Rod looked up, the whole room looked like a cabin, no lights, no phone, no call bell. A wooden table, two chairs and a cupboard fixed to the wall were all that was here. Somehow, Rod felt as if he had seen this scene somewhere. And just as Rod carefully surveyed this room, the door suddenly opened. A young blonde girl in a white robe entered the room, she looked at the half-sitting Rod, some surprised eyes widened. "You're awake? Great!!!" The words that came out of the young girl's mouth were not in Chinese, nor in English, but Rod was able to clearly understand what she was saying. This makes Rod can't help but be a little surprised that he knows this language. This is Nim language, one of the official languages of the Dragon Soul Continent! "How does it feel? Is it okay?" But the young girl didn't care about Rod's expression, she quickly walked to Rod's side and carefully examined his left shoulder and chest. "Your injury is really serious, frankly speaking, I am a little worried about whether you can hold up ......" "This is ......... "Rod frowned, but did not know what to say, he turned his head and looked at the mirror on the wall next to him, where his own face was clearly reflected, it was indeed his face no mistake, but it should not appear here to ah. "Did you forget?" The blonde girl blinked her eyes in some confusion, the ponytail on both sides also accompanied by her movements slightly swayed, azure eyes clear and transparent, giving a lively feeling. "Two days ago, you collapsed in the Palfield Mountain Plain and suffered a rather serious injury." "If the 'Silver Libra' Chamber of Commerce's cargo ship hadn't passed by, I'm afraid it would have been quite bad." "I really don't know what exactly you were fighting with, the left side of your body was quite badly damaged, that time can be very dangerous." Wait, left shoulder? Rod froze for a moment, he immediately remembered, wasn't it his left side that was attacked at the end of his previous battle with the Void Dragon? But that was an injury to his own character in the game, it shouldn't have anything to do with the player himself, but now, it was he himself who was injured? Although the state of affairs in front of him was a mess, but Rod still quickly calmed down, this is his mental quality as a top player and the world's most powerful online game guild president. And in the conversation with the blonde girl in front of him, Rod also learned his current situation, he was seriously injured in the middle of the Plain of Parfield, and the Silver Libra Chamber of Commerce's floating ship happened to pass by and saved him up. According to the blonde girl, Rod was in a bad way at first, but his recovery ability was quite good. "My name is Lige. I'm a member of the Star Moon Mercenaries, a spirit master, just call me Lige." The young lady introduced herself to Rod in a big way. "My name is Rod. Elanthe." Although there was no way to sort out the situation in front of him yet, Rod hesitated slightly and reported his identity and id in the game, "From the Eastern Mountain Plain, an adventurer." "Adventurer, so that's why you're alone in the deep mountains so far away." Hearing Rod's answer, Lige didn't feel surprised, because on this continent, there are quite a few adventurers who like to explore around alone, so this identity that Rod reported wasn't much of a problem. "However, what exactly are you fighting with?" "Why did you get so badly injured?" "I remember that in this plain area, there shouldn't be any particularly scary monsters." Hearing the young girl's inquiry, Rod smiled with some difficulty. What could he say, could he tell Lige that he was injured while fighting with the Dragon of the Void, known as one of the Five Dragons of Creation? "Because I was attacked at night, I didn't get a good look at what exactly was on the other side, they were many and fast, I thought, maybe it was something from 'over there'." "I see." Although Rod did not elaborate, but Lige nodded as if she understood something, then she carefully examined Rod's wounds before standing up. "Two days without food, I think you must be very hungry, please wait a moment, I will now immediately go to get some food." "Ah, yes, I have to report to the chief about this, I think he will come to see you soon." After saying these words, the young girl then politely nodded to Rod, then turned around and walked out of the room.
