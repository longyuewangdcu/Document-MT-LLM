The wind blows across the canyon and set off a wave of waves on the grassland.	 The bison that was eating the green grass leaves looked up and looked at the sky.	 There, a dozens of meters of wooden business ships were hanging in the air, and the full ship sailing moved to the wind and moved forward slowly.	 "Whenever you look, this trend is so spectacular." The middle -aged man wearing a leather armor stood beside the deck and overlooks the endless grassland and beautiful scenery.	 "For our businessmen, this is also a rare business opportunity." It was a slightly obese businessman standing beside the middle -aged man. He kept a weird curly hair, wearing a businessman's robe, and two small eyes narrowed slightly.	 Living is looking at the scenery in front of him, looking at him, as if even the beautiful scenery in front of him can sell money.	 "Without it, I am afraid that we can't transport the goods into the central region so quickly." "To be honest, I was still opposed when I planned to expand this market, but now it seems that my choice is indeed indeed indeed	 It is correct. "" But, please, please bluntly, you did not choose a large channel. Instead, you walked here. Although it will save time, the degree of danger will also increase. " "I heard that the other side is restless recently. And, I think you have heard the captain reminded that there seems to be a wind snake recently nearby, in case ..." The man's complexion has become a bit dignified.	 Viewed to the mountains not far away.	 The towering mountain peak blocked his sight and couldn't see what it looked like.	 But it can be seen that the sky in the distance in the distance is not pure blue, but with a gloomy darkness.	 That's not the world they should get involved.	 "Rest assured, how can there be so many in case, wealth and wealth insurance, this is why I spend so much money to hire you!"	 Shoulder.	 "By the way, how are we rescued that young man now?" "It's not dead yet." "Li Jie has bandaged the wound for him. Now he is lethargic, and there should be no life danger." "That's it." Hearing the man's answer, the businessman nodded with satisfaction, but then he wrinkled quickly.	 Rest eyebrows.	 "However, what was the injury of that young man who suffered? From the wound point of view, it was like a big lizard -but there is such a weird thing in northern Pofeld?" "I donâ€™t know, adult, but I want to come, but I want to come, but I want to come.	 It should be a very fierce beast. I hope we will not touch it. "Then, the man subconsciously glanced at the entrance of the cabin, and then he turned his head again and looked forward.	 Rhode opened his eyes.	 What happened?	 He stared at the ceiling in front of him blankly, and his brain was stunned.	 He remembers that he should lead the team and the most powerful BOSS Void Dragon Battle on the Ruins high platform before, and successfully won the first kill.	 Zhilong's last blow also took away his life. According to the original plan, Rhodes should be resurrected in the cemetery and then log in to the line.	 But at the moment he was killed by the Dragon of the Void, the whole world immediately became dark, as if forcibly wasolated, and then Rhodes lost consciousness.	 How can this be?	 Is there something wrong with the game?	 Rhode reluctantly turned his head and could see the blue sky and Baiyun outside from the window. Where was he?	 where is this place?	 What on earth happened?	 Is he still dreaming?	 Or is it still in the game?	 At least Rhodes can be sure that the place in the current place is definitely not his narrow rental apartment. Thinking of this, wondering immediately rushed to Rhode's heart, he frowned, and then tried to sit up.	 "Woo !!!" At this moment, a huge pain suddenly came from Rhode's chest. He bit his teeth and stopped his movement.	 At this time, Rhodes discovered that his left shoulder and chest were completely wrapped in bandages. Although he didn't know what happened, but from the blood stains that were penetrating the above, he was obviously not injured.	 This is definitely not a game!	 Rhodes can be sure of this. You must know that although technology is now quite developed, the dragon soul continent, which is the first virtual online game in the world, also uses many high -tech technologies.	 However, according to the rules, it is impossible for players to experience pain. This is to distinguish the reality from the game, and at the same time, it also has considerations to reduce the threshold of the player.	 When the player is injured, instead of pain, the game will use the player's movement speed and use the critical red to block a series of ways to disturb the player's normal game to warn and remind them, rather than the real simulation of pain.	 Essence	 This behavior has caused considerable arguments in society when the holographic simulation technology just appeared. Naturally, it is impossible for operating companies in the Dragon Soul Continent to know this.	 Rhodes lowered his head and stared at his right hand. It was not the character that he created in the game, not the body full of muscles and wild body.	 On the contrary, the arms in front of you are slender and weak, because the skin is not shined all year round, and the skin is a little pale. This is his body in reality, he knows this very well.	 But how could he be injured?	 Moreover, it is not like a hospital here?	 Rhodes looked up. The entire room seemed to be a cabin, no lights, no phone calls, and no call bell.	 A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed by the wall are all home here.	 I don't know why, Rhode feels like where he has seen this scene.	 And when Rhodes looked at the room carefully, the door suddenly opened.	 A blonde girl in a white robe walked into the room. She looked at Rhodes, who was half -sitting, and opened her eyes in surprise.	 "You wake up? It's great!" What the girl said was not Chinese or English, but Rhodes could clearly understand what she was talking about. This surprised Rhodes a little, he knew this language.	 This is one of the official languages of Nim, one of the official languages of the Dragon Soul Continent!	 "How do you feel? Is it okay?" But the girl didn't care about Rhode's expression. She quickly walked to Rhodes and carefully checked his left shoulder and chest.	 "Your injury can be really serious. Frankly, I am a little worried about whether you can support it ..." "This is ..." Rhode frowned, but did not know what to say. He turned his head and looked at it.	 The mirror on the side of the wall clearly reflected his face clearly. It was indeed that his face was not wrong, but it should not appear here.	 "Have you forgotten?" The blond girl blinked her eyes in doubt, and the ponytail on both sides was shaking with her movements slightly. The blue eyes were clear and transparent, giving a lively feeling.	 "Two days ago, you fell into the Pofengshanyuan, and he was very seriously injured." "If it wasn't for the cargo ship of the" Silver Sky "Chamber of Commerce, I am afraid it would be quite bad." "I really don't know what you are fighting with it, the body on the left is very serious. At that time, it was really dangerous.	 Ah. "Wait, left shoulder?	 Rhodes stunned for a while, and he immediately remembered that he had been attacked on the left side at the end of the fight with the Dragon of the Void before?	 But that's the injury of the characters in the game, it should have nothing to do with the player itself, but now, it is him who is injured?	 Although the situation in front of him was chaotic, Rhodes still calmed down quickly. This is his psychological quality as a top player and the most powerful chairman of the world in the world.	 In the conversation with the blond girl in front of him, Rhodes also learned that his current situation was seriously injured.	 Save up.	 According to this blond girl, Rhodes' situation was not optimistic at first, but his recovery ability was quite good.	 "My name is Li Jie Noiseu, a member of the Xingyue Mercenary Corps, a spirit teacher, just call me Li Jie." The girl introduced itself to Rhodes. "My name is Rhode Airant." Although there was no way to sort out the situation in front of me, Rhodes hesitated and reported his identity and ID in the game.	 "From Dongfang Shanyuan, it is an adventurer." "Adventurer, so, so you will be alone in such a distant mountains." Hearing Rhodes' answer, Li Jie was not surprised because it was in	 On this continent, many adventurers like to explore alone, so this identity on Rhodes has no big problems.	 "However, what are you fighting with?" "Why are you suffering such a heavy injury?" "I remember that in this plain area, there should be no particularly terrible monsters." Hearing the girl's question, Roder Rhod	 Some embarrassed smiled.	 What can he say, did he tell Li Jie that he was injured while fighting with the Void Dragon of the Five Dragons of the Creation? "Because I was attacked at night, I didn't see what the other party was. They had a lot and fast speed. I think, maybe it is something that is' there." "I understand."	 Although Rhodes didn't explain in detail, Li Jie seemed to know something, and then she carefully checked Rhode's wound, so she stood up.	 "I didn't eat for two days, I think you must be hungry, please wait, I will get some food now." "Ah, by the way, I also have to report to the head of the group. I think	 He will come to see you soon. "After speaking, the girl nodded slightly to Rhodes, then turned around and walked out of the room.
