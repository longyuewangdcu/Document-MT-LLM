The strong wind blew through the canyon, causing waves on the grassland. The bison that was eating the green leaves raised its head and looked up at the sky. There, a wooden merchant ship that was dozens of meters long was suspended in the air. The full sails were blown by the wind and slowly moved forward."This is also a rare business opportunity." Standing next to the middle-aged man was a slightly obese merchant. He had a head of strange curly hair and was wearing a merchant's robe. His small eyes were slightly narrowed as he looked at the scenery in front of him as if he was calculating something. From the look of it, it was as if even the beautiful scenery in front of him could be sold for money." I was once opposed when I planned to expand this market, but now it seems that my choice was indeed the right one. However, please forgive me for being blunt. You didn't choose a large channel. Instead, you took this route. Although it will save time, it will also increase the risk. " " I heard that the other side isn't peaceful recently. Besides, I think you've heard from the captain that there seem to be Wind Snakes around here recently. What if ... " The man's expression became a little solemn. He turned his head and looked at the mountain range not far away. The towering mountain peak blocked his view, so he couldn't see what was behind it. However, he could vaguely see that the sky in the distance was not pure blue." Don't worry, there's no such thing as a 'what-if'. Wealth comes from danger. That's why I hired you guys at such a high price! " " It's just a few snakes, isn't it? " The merchant reached out and patted the man's shoulder. " By the way, how's the young man we saved? " " He's not dead, is he? " " That's good. " Hearing the man's answer, the merchant nodded in satisfaction. However, he quickly frowned. " But, what kind of injury did that young man suffer? From the wound, it looks like a big lizard. But is there such a strange thing in the north of Paphield? "" I hope we don't run into each other. " The man subconsciously glanced at the entrance of the cabin and turned his head to look ahead. Rhode opened his eyes. What happened? He stared blankly at the ceiling in front of him and his mind was in a daze. He remembered that he should have led his team to fight against the strongest boss in the Dragon Soul Continent, the Void Dragon, and successfully obtained the First Clear. He confirmed that he had obtained an achievement and a system notification.Then, the Void Dragon's final attack took his life. According to the original plan, Rhode should have resurrected in the graveyard and logged out. However, the moment he was killed by the Void Dragon, the entire world turned pitch-black as if it was forcibly isolated. Then, Rhode lost consciousness. How was this possible? Could it be that there was something wrong with the game? Rhode reluctantly turned his head and could see the blue sky and white clouds outside." Where am I? What is this place? What exactly happened? Is he still dreaming? Or am I still in the game? At least Rhode was sure that this place wasn't his small rental apartment. " Rhode frowned and tried to sit up. " Woo!!! " At this moment, a huge pain suddenly came from his chest. He gritted his teeth and stopped. Rhode realized that his left shoulder and chest were completely wrapped in bandages. Although he didn't know what happened, he could tell from the bloodstains that were seeping out from the bandages." This isn't a game! " Rhode was sure of this. Although technology was already advanced and the Dragon Soul Continent, the world's first virtual global online game, used a lot of high-tech technology, according to the rules, players couldn't feel pain. This was to differentiate reality from the game. At the same time, it also lowered the threshold for players.The game would use a series of methods to interfere with the normal game to warn and remind players, such as slowing down the player's movement speed and using red to block the player's vision. Instead of simulating the real pain. This behavior had caused a considerable controversy in the society when the holographic simulation technology first appeared. Naturally, the operating company of the Dragon Soul Continent knew about this. Rhode lowered his head and stared at his right hand. That wasn't the character he created in the game.It was not that muscular and wild body, but the arm in front of him was thin and weak, and because it had not been exposed to the sun for many years, its skin was a little sickly pale. This was his body in reality. He knew this very well. But, how did he get injured? Besides, this place didn't look like a hospital. Rhode looked up and saw that the entire room looked like a cabin. There were no lights, no phone, and no call bell. A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed to the wall were all the belongings here. For some reason,Rhode felt as if he had seen this scene somewhere before. Just as he was examining the room, the door suddenly opened. A golden-haired girl in a white robe walked into the room. She looked at Rhode who was sitting up and widened her eyes in surprise. " You're awake? That's great!! " The girl wasn't speaking in Chinese or English, but Rhode could clearly understand what she was saying. " How do you feel? Are you alright? " The young lady didn't care about Rhode's expression. She quickly walked to Rhode's side and carefully examined his left shoulder and chest. " Your injuries are really serious. Frankly speaking, I'm a little worried if you can hold onâ€¦"" Have you forgotten? " The blonde girl blinked her eyes in confusion. Her ponytails swayed slightly as she moved. Her blue eyes were clear and transparent, giving off a lively feeling. " Two days ago, you fell on the plains of Paphield Mountain and were seriously injured. " " If it wasn't for the Silver Libra Merchant's cargo ship passing by, I'm afraid things would have been rather bad. I really don't know what you were fighting against. Your left side was seriously injured. It was really dangerous at that time. " Wait, left shoulder? Rhode was stunned. He immediately remembered that in the end of his battle with the Void Dragon, wasn't his left side attacked? But that was his character in the game who was injured." It shouldn't have anything to do with the players themselves, right? But now, the one who was injured was himself? Although the situation before him was chaotic, Rhode quickly calmed down. This was the psychological quality of a top-tier player and the world's strongest guild leader. From the conversation with the blonde girl, Rhode learned about his current situation. He was heavily injured and collapsed in Paphield Plains." My name is Lize Noelu. I'm a member of the Star Moon Mercenary Group. I'm a Cleric. You can call me Lize. " The blonde girl introduced herself to Rhode. Rhode was in a bad state at first, but his recovery rate was pretty good. " My name is Rhode Alant. " Even though he couldn't sort out the situation, Rhode hesitated for a moment before reporting his identity and ID. " I'm from the Eastern Plains. I'm an adventurer. "" But what exactly are you fighting against? " " Why are you so heavily injured? " " I remember that there shouldn't be any particularly terrifying monsters in this plain area. " Rhode smiled awkwardly. What could he say? Could he tell Lize that he was injured in the battle with the Void Dragon, one of the Five Creator Dragons? " I understand. " Although Rhode didn't explain in detail, Lize nodded as if she understood something. After carefully examining Rhode's wound, she stood up. " I haven't eaten for two days. I'm sure you must be hungry. Please wait a moment. "" Ah, by the way, I have to report this to the leader. I think he will come to see you soon. " After saying this, the young lady nodded politely at Rhode and walked out of the room.
