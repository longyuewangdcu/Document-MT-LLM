This was exactly what Song Fu and the others wanted to ask, but someone had already asked it before them. They looked at each other, not knowing what was going on, and were unable to answer. Miao Yi immediately flew towards the source of the loud noise, followed by Yan Xiu and his two companions. Song Fu and the others exchanged glances and followed to see what was going on. When everyone arrived at the entrance of the mountain gate, they saw that the stone archway with the words "Donglai Cave" carved on it had been shattered under the moonlight, which surprised everyone. Someone had actually destroyed the mountain gate of Donglai Cave. Miao Yi suddenly turned around, his face fierce as he looked at Song Fu and the others, sneering incessantly, "Very well! I just arrived today, and it seems that someone couldn't wait to give me a warning! Excellent!" Song Fu and the others were taken aback. They understood the meaning behind Miao Yi's words, but they absolutely didn't do it. They had just been sitting together, discussing how to deal with Miao Yi in the future, and had only come out when they heard the strange noise. They had initially suspected Miao Yi and his group, but seeing Miao Yi's reaction, they thought Miao Yi wouldn't have any reason to destroy his own mountain gate. After all, Miao Yi was the new cave master of Donglai Cave, and having his sign destroyed right after taking office was an embarrassing matter. This issue had to be clarified; otherwise, if it escalated, they wouldn't be able to bear the responsibility. Song Fu said solemnly with a fist salute, "Cave Master, this matter is absolutely not done by us!" The others also followed suit, saluting with their fists and seemingly treating Miao Yi as the cave master for the first time. "Making excuses!" Miao Yi stared at Song Fu and said harshly, "I just appointed you to guard the mountain gate today. How could you not know that someone destroyed it? Are you deliberately letting them off?" "Well..." Song Fu was at a loss for words. He hadn't been here at all, and it wasn't appropriate to say that he didn't take Miao Yi's position as cave master seriously, so he could only salute with his fists and 'honestly' explain, "Cave Master, you might not know the situation since you just arrived. The miscellaneous personnel of Donglai City have not yet been dispatched, and we have to handle our own meals. To satisfy our hunger, I temporarily left for a short while, not expecting such a thing to happen." Wang Zifa and the others also successively saluted with their fists, testifying, "Cave Master, we can testify that Elder Brother Song Fu was just having a meal with us." Miao Yi pointed at the fallen archway and said harshly, "Did it fall down by itself? Don't tell me it was blown over by the wind!" Song Fu felt like he was in a difficult situation and had no choice but to raise his hand, "Cave Master, I can swear to the ancestors of my Blue Jade Sect that this is absolutely not our doing. If there is even half a lie, may I, Song Fu, never die a peaceful death!" Miao Yi's eyes flickered uncertainly as he scanned the crowd, his tone gloomy, "Could someone be causing trouble in my Donglai Cave?" Everyone was startled and thought that it was indeed possible, so they quickly looked around. "What are you waiting for here? Do you want to be killed in your sleep?" "Don't just stand there, go search!" Miao Yi shouted angrily. Yan Xiu and his two companions were the first to salute with their fists and quickly dispersed into the surrounding forests. "Hmm?" Miao Yi let out a heavy snort through his nostrils, glaring at Song Fu and the others, seemingly questioning why they didn't go to search if they hadn't done it. Did they know something? At this time, they had to make a statement to prove that they had nothing to do with it. Song Fu immediately turned around and shouted, "Why aren't you following the Cave Master's orders to search!" Everyone saluted Miao Yi and dispersed at once. However, Song Fu was stopped by Miao Yi, "Song Fu, come with me!" Song Fu hesitated for a moment, saluted with his fists, and followed behind Miao Yi. After everyone left, a phantom-like figure appeared at the scene, as if it were a shadow in the water. It was none other than the striking figure of Old Bai. Old Bai stared at the fallen stone archway, shook his head slightly, and chuckled, "Life is like a game of chess; hot-blooded men should not only possess the courage of a common man! I have always been worried that you were too kind-hearted by nature and would easily suffer losses... A man should be skilled in his actions; a mere brute can hardly reach the heavens. Now, I am quite relieved." As his words fell, the entire figure wavered like ripples in the water and quietly disappeared without a trace. In the Donglai main hall, the candlelight flickered. Song Fu followed Miao Yi and stood one after another inside the hall, while the servant outside had already stood up, seemingly sensing something and sneezing. Miao Yi stared expressionlessly at his throne, his hands behind his back, not saying a word to Song Fu. The atmosphere between the two was somewhat oppressive. After waiting for a while, Song Fu couldn't help but ask, "What does the Cave Master want from me?" Miao Yi's tone was gloomy, "Song Fu, do you know your crime?" Song Fu's mouth revealed a hint of ridicule, and he glanced at the food and wine on the low table nearby, saying indifferently, "This matter is absolutely not done by us. What crime does Song Fu have?" "I'm not asking about that!" Miao Yi suddenly turned around, staring at him, and coldly asked word by word, "I ordered you to guard the mountain gate. Why did you leave your post without permission? Do you not take my orders as Cave Master seriously?" Song Fu thought to himself, 'Do you really think so? I never took you seriously in the first place.' Of course, he wouldn't say that aloud, "I have already reported to the Cave Master that I was truly helpless and only left temporarily to satisfy my hunger. I didn't want to see such an incident happen either." Miao Yi asked, "Do you think the Prefecture Master and Mountain Master will believe your explanation after I report this matter?" Song Fu laughed, "People have two sides to their mouths. If Cave Master insists on framing me, then please go ahead. But don't forget, I also have a mouth to defend myself, and I am not a mute." Miao Yi sneered, "It seems you really have no regrets even in death!" At these words, Yan Xiu, Shan BiaoYi, and Qiu ShaoQun appeared outside the door together, walked in, and saluted Miao Yi, "Cave Master, we haven't found any suspicious individuals for the time being." Miao Yi said, "The suspicious person is right in front of our eyes, so there's no need to say that we haven't found them!" Shan BiaoYi and Qiu ShaoQun seemed to have received a signal and quickly closed the hall door. Startled by the sound, Song Fu quickly turned around, only to see Yan Xiu's pair of iron axes furiously chopping down like a god of death. Song Fu swiftly drew his sword, a cold light emerging from the sheath, and promptly blocked the attack with a clanging sound. Shan BiaoYi and Qiu ShaoQun also brandished their spears in an instant, joining forces to attack Song Fu. Yan Xiu and Song Fu were of similar cultivation levels, and their strengths were evenly matched. With Shan BiaoYi and Qiu ShaoQun joining forces, Song Fu's situation instantly became precarious. "Shameless villain!" "How dare you plot to harm..." Surrounded and unable to escape, Song Fu fought fiercely against Yan Xiu while wielding his sword. His furious roar was cut short as two spears pierced through his magical defense and ruthlessly stabbed into his chest. Song Fu's eyes widened as he struggled to turn towards Miao Yi, his trembling lips and the anger in his eyes indescribable. He finally understood that this was a trap. The collapse of the mountain gate plaque was not only meant to frame him but also to lure away his fellow disciples to prevent them from joining forces in rebellion. The main objective was to take his life.
