This is exactly what Song Fu and others want to ask, was asked first, you look at me, I look at you, do not know what is going on, where to answer. Miao Yi immediately flew to the place where the loud noise was made, Yan Xiu three immediately followed. Song Fu and others looked at each other and also followed to see what was going on. The crowd arrived at the entrance of the mountain gate, only to see that under the moonlight, the stone carving with the three words 'Donglai Cave' had broken to the ground, so that everyone was shocked that someone had destroyed the mountain gate of Donglai Cave. Miao Yi turned around haughtily and looked at Song Fu and the others with a fierce face, sneering and saying, "Good!" "I just arrived today, and it seems that someone can't wait to give me a good show!" "Very well!" Song Fu and the others were stunned, they understood the meaning of the other party's words, but this was definitely not their doing, because they were just sitting around together for a small gathering, and were also discussing how to give Miao Yi color in the future, and also ran out only when they heard the unusual noise. Several people also suspected that they were not Miao Yi, see Miao Yi this way, think Miao Yi also do not need to smash their own mountain door to give their own color, after all, Miao Yi is the Dong Lai Cave cave master, just after the appointment was smashed signboard is a matter of shame. This kind of thing must be said clearly, otherwise once stabbed up can not afford to take the responsibility, Song Fu positive color cupped fist and said: "cave master, this matter is never our doing! Several other people also followed and clasped their fists in assurance, seemingly treating Miao Yi as a cave master for the first time in a serious manner. "Sophistry!" Miao Yi stared at Song Fu and said sternly, "I appointed you to guard the mountain gate only today, would you not know that someone has destroyed the gate?" "Could it be that you intentionally let the water out!" "This ......" Song Fu was stumped, he was not here at all, now it is not good to say that I did not put you in the eyes of the cave master that is why I was not here, can only clasp fists 'honest' account said The cave master just came may not know the situation, the handyman of the East City has not yet been sent, we are handling our own food and drink, in order to stomach, subordinates temporarily left a little, did not expect such a thing happened." Wang Zifa and others also clasped their fists one after another and proved, "Cave Master, we can prove that Senior Brother Song Fu was having a meal with us just now." Miao Yi pointed at the fallen pagoda and said sternly, "Did this fall down by itself? You must not tell me that it was blown down by the wind!" Song Fu was a bit dumb and had to raise his hand and said, "Cave Master, I can swear to my ancestors of the Blue Jade Sect that this was never done by us, and if there is any half-hearted falsehood, I will be called Song Fu to a bad death!" Miao Yi's gaze flickered and swept over the crowd, and said in a gloomy tone, "Did someone come to my Donglai Cave to cause trouble?" The crowd was shocked, there is really this possibility, all quickly look around. "What are you guys still waiting for here? Do you want to be wiped in your sleep?" "Why don't you spread out and search!" Miao Yi said angrily. Yan Xiu three people first clasped their fists in response and quickly scattered to the surrounding mountains and forests. "Hm?" Miao Yi nasal cavity heavy hum, gaze glared at Song Fu and others, seemingly questioning since you did not do it, why not go to search, is not know what? At this time, Song Fu immediately turned around and shouted, "Don't obey the cave master's order to search!" All the people bowed their hands to Miao Yi and immediately dispersed. However, Song Fu was called by Miao Yi, "Song Fu, you come with me!" Song Fu was stunned, clasped his fist and said yes, followed behind Miao Yi. Just after the crowd left, a silhouette like a human figure in water appeared in place, no other than the magnificent old white figure. Just see the old white stared at the fallen stone gate pagoda, slightly shook his head and lightly laughed: "The world is like a chess, hot-blooded men can not only the courage of a man!" "I've been worried that you are too good natured, easy to lose... Men should have skills, reckless men can not reach the sky, now I am quite relieved." The words fell, the whole figure and as water waves like swaying, in the swaying quietly disappeared without a trace. The wax torch shakes the shadows in the east hall, Song Fu followed behind Miao Yi and stood one after the other in the hall, outside the black charcoal has stood up, seems to notice what sneezed. Miao Yi stared at his throne expressionlessly, with his back to Song Fu with his hands folded, without saying a word. The atmosphere between the two was a bit depressing, Song Fu waited for a while and finally couldn't help but ask: "What did the cave master summon me for?" Miao Yi said in a gloomy tone, "Song Fu, do you know the crime?" The corner of Song Fu's mouth showed sarcasm, glanced at the food and wine on the low table, and said indifferently, "This is not our doing, what is Song Fu's crime?" "That's not what I'm asking!" Miao Yi turned around abruptly, stared at him, and asked coldly, word by word: "I ordered you to guard the mountain gate, why did you leave without permission? Could it be that you don't put my orders as the cave master in your eyes?" Song Fu thought to himself, "What do you think? I didn't put it in my eyes. Of course, he didn't say so, "Song Fu has already reported to the cave master, I have no choice but to leave temporarily for the sake of my stomach, I don't want to see such a thing happen." Miao Yi asked, "Do you think that after I report this matter, the House Master and Mountain Master there will believe your explanation?" Song Fu laughed and said, "People's mouths have two skins, if the cave master wants to falsely accuse Song, then be my guest, but don't forget, I also have a mouth to defend, not a mute." Miao Yi said heatedly, "It seems that you are really unrepentant!" As soon as these words came out, Yan Xiu, Shan Guan and Qiu Shaoqun appeared outside the door in a flash and walked in together and said to Miao Yi: "Cave Master, no suspicious person has been found for now." Miao Yi said, "The suspicious person is right in front of us, why is there no suspicious person?" Single table Yi and Qiu Shaoqun seems to have received a signal, quickly dodged the temple door a closed. Song Fu heard the sound of a startled, quickly turn around, but see the god of killing Yan Xiu a pair of axes have been angrily cleaved and come. Song Fu quickly pulled out his sword, a cold light out of the sheath, quickly DingZhongDangJing to block. The single table Yi and Qiu Shaoqun also almost instantly out of the gun, teamed up to attack Song Fu. Yan Xiu and Song Fu's cultivation level was about the same, the two were already evenly matched, and with the addition of Shan Watchyi and Qiu Shaoqun, Song Fu's situation instantly became precarious. "Shameless thief!" "How dare you murder ......" surrounded, unable to get out, can swing the sword and Yan Xiu desperately clinging together Song Fu sorrowful roar has not finished shouting, then by the desperate piercing two guns pierced through the mana defense, ruthlessly into the chest. Song Fu's eyes widened as he tried to look back at Miao Yi, shivering his lips, the anger in his eyes indescribable. He finally understood that this was a trap, the collapse of the mountain gate pagoda was not only to be planted on him, but also to transfer his fellow disciples away, in order to prevent him from uniting with his fellow disciples to resist, the main purpose was to take his life.
