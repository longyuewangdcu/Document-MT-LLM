This is exactly what Song Fu and others want to ask. They were asked first. Look at me, I look at you, I don't know what's going on and where to answer.	 Miao Yi immediately flew into the place where there was a loud noise, and Yan Xiu followed up immediately.	 Song Fu and others looked at each other, and followed up.	 When everyone came to the gate of the mountain gate, I saw that under the moonlight, the stone carving archway engraved with the words "Donglai Cave" has been broken, which surprised everyone, and some people destroyed the mountain gate of Donglaidong.	 Miao Yi Huoran looked back, looking at Song Fu and others with a sorrowful face, and sneered: "Okay!" "I just arrived today, it seems that someone can't wait to give me a horse!" "Very good!" Song Fu et al.	 People are stunned, and they understand what the other party means, but they are definitely not they did, because they just sat together and gathered together, and they were discussing how to look at Miao Yi in the future.	 Running out.	 Several people still doubted whether Miao Yi did it. It can be seen that Miao Yi looks like this. I feel that Miao Yi does not need to smash her mountain gate to see her color. After all, Miao Yi is the owner of Donglaidong.	 It is shameful to smash the sign.	 This kind of thing must be made clear, otherwise once you can't afford this responsibility, Song Fuzheng Baozhang: "The owner, this matter is by no means what I do!" Several other people also followed the punch to ensure that it was the first time that Zhengerba had treated Miao Yi as the owner.	 "Sophistication!" Miao Yi stared at Song Fuli: "I just approved you to guard the mountain gate today. Someone destroyed the mountain gate, would you don't know?"	 He wasn't here at all, and it is hard to say now that I do nâ€™t put your cave owner at all at all.	 The miscellaneous service came to the city has not yet been sent, and I have been dealing with my own diet. For the sake of the belly, the subordinates left for a while. I did not expect that this happened. "	 , I can prove that Brother Song Fu was just eating with us just now. "Miao Yi pointed at the pouring archway and said," Is this it fell down? Don't tell me that it is blowing down by the wind.	 ! "Song Fu was a bit dumb to eat Huang Lian, and I had to raise my hand:" Cave owner, I can swear to my Lan Yumen calendar, this is not what we do.	 Dead! "Miao Yi glanced at everyone with a flash of eyes, and said gloomyly:" Does anyone come to me to make trouble? " Everyone was shocked, and it was really possible, and they looked around quickly.	 "What are you waiting for here? Do you want to be wiped out of his neck in your sleep?" "I can't get a search for me yet!" Miao Yi said angrily.	 Yan Xiu's three people first held their fists and quickly spread to the surrounding mountains and forests.	 "Huh?" Miao Yi snorted with a heavy nasal cavity and stared at Song Fu and others. It seemed that he was questioning that since you did not do it, why not search, do you know what?	 At this time, why did you have to prove that it has nothing to do with him and others. Song Fu immediately turned around and said, "Do not follow the main order of the cave!" The crowd arched with Miao Yi and immediately spread out.	 However, Song Fu was called by Miao Yi, "Song Fu, you come with me!" Song Fu stunned, holding fists and said it was behind Miao Yi.	 Just after everyone left, a shadow of the shadow of the water appeared in place, not others, and it was the old white figure of the storm.	 I saw Lao Bai staring at the falling Shimen archway, and shook his head slightly and laughed: "The world is like chess, can the bloody man only have the courage of the husband!" "I have always worried that your child's nature is too kind and easy to lose ...	 The reckless husband is hard to reach the sky, but now I am relieved. "The words were shaking like a water wave, and quietly disappeared in the shaking.	 The wax torch of the Donglai Hall shakes the shadow.	 Miao Yi stared at her throne expressionlessly, facing Song Fu with a negative back, without saying a word.	 The atmosphere between the two was a bit depressed. After Song Fu waited for a while, he couldn't help asking: "What happened to the cave owner?"	 I was ridiculed, glanced at the wine and vegetables on the dwarf table, and said indifferently: "This matter is by no means waiting for me to do, what sin Song Fu is?" "I'm not asking this!" Miao Yi Huoran turned, staring at him, and asked coldly: "I ordered you to guard the mountain gate, why are you good at leaving the position?	 In your eyes! "Song Fu thought, what do you think?	 It was not in my eyes.	 Of course, the mouth does not say that, "Song Fu has already made it to the owner, and it is helpless, just for the temporary leave of the fruit abdomen, I don't want to see such a thing." Miao Yi asked: "You think me, I think me	 After the intelligence of this matter is up, will the master and the mountain owner believe your explanation? "Song Fu laughed:" Two people in the mouth of the human mouth, the owner of the cave must be framed Song, then please, but the hole, but the hole, but the hole, but the hole, but the cave, but the hole, but the hole	 Don't forget the Lord, there is also a mouthful, not dumb. "Miao Yi said:" It seems that you really don't repent! "As soon as this remark, Yan Xiu, Single Thaksin and Qiu Shaoqun appeared outside the door and appeared outside the door.	 After walking in, I came in and hugged Miao Yi: "The owner, no suspicious person is found for the time being." Miao Yi said: "Suspicious people are in front of me, so why not find out!" The single -watch righteousness and Qiu Shaoqun seemed to receive a secret sign, and quickly closed the temple door.	 Song Fuwen was shocked, and quickly turned back, but when he saw that Yan Xiu's pair of ax had been murdered.	 Song Fu quickly pulled out the sword, a cold shine, and quickly died.	 Single -watch righteousness and Qiu Shaoqun almost came out in an instant, and joined forces to siege Song Fu.	 Yan Xiu and Song Fu were similar, and the two were evenly matched. In addition, the single -table righteousness and Qiu Shaoqun joined forces to join, and the situation of Song Fu became precarious instantly.	 "Shameless thief!" "Annone and murdered ..." Surrounded, he couldn't get away.	 The gun pierced the mana defense, and he pierced into his chest fiercely.	 Song Fu widened his eyes and tried to look back at Miao Yi, stunned his lips, and the anger in his eyes could not be described.	 He finally understood that this was a trap. The collapse of the Shanmen archway not only had to plant it on him, but also to transfer his same door to avoid him to fight with the same door. The main purpose was to want his life.
