This was exactly what Song Fu and the others wanted to ask, but someone else was the first to ask. They looked at each other, not knowing what was going on, so how could they answer? Miao Yi immediately flew towards the source of the explosion. Yan Xiu and the other two immediately followed behind. Song Fu and the others exchanged glances, then followed after him to see what was going on. When everyone arrived at the entrance of the mountain gate, they saw that under the moonlight, the large stone memorial archway with the words 'East Arrival Cave' engraved on it had already shattered onto the ground. Everyone was shocked.Miao Yi suddenly turned his head around and looked at Song Fu and the others with a ferocious expression. He laughed coldly and said," Very good! " Song Fu and the others were stunned. They understood the meaning behind the other party's words, but they definitely weren't the ones who did this. This was because they had just been sitting together for a small gathering, and were also discussing how they were going to teach Miao Yi a lesson in the future. They had only come running out after hearing an unusual noise. They had originally suspected that Miao Yi and the others were the ones who did this, but it was obvious from Miao Yi's actions.He felt that there was no need for Miao Yi to smash his own mountain gate to show his face. After all, Miao Yi was the Cave Master of East Arrival Cave. Having his signboard smashed right after taking office was a shameful thing to do. Such a matter had to be clearly explained. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to bear the responsibility if he were to make it known. Song Fu cupped his fists and said,"Cave Master, this matter was definitely not our doing!" The others also cupped their fists and promised. It seemed like this was the first time they were treating Miao Yi as a Cave Master."Could it be that you deliberately went easy on me?""This…" Song Fu was at a loss for words. He was not here at all, and it was not easy to say that he was not here because he did not take you, the Cave Master, seriously." Cave Master might not know the situation since he just arrived, but the servants from East Arrival City have not been sent over yet. We have to take care of our own food and drink. In order to fill our stomachs, this subordinate temporarily left. I didn't expect such a thing to happen. " Wang Zifa and the others also cupped their fists one after another to prove.Cave Master, we can prove that Senior Brother Song Fu was having a meal with us just now, " Miao Yi pointed at the fallen memorial archway and said sternly, "Don't tell me that you were blown down by the wind! " Song Fu was a little dumb and had to raise his hand." Cave Master, I can swear to all the previous masters of my School of Blue Jade that this was not our doing. If there's even the slightest lie, I, Song Fu, will die a horrible death! " Miao Yi's eyes flickered as he swept his gaze across the crowd."Could it be that someone has come to my East Arrival Cave to cause trouble?" " What are you waiting for? Do you want to have your necks slit in your sleep? " Miao Yi shouted angrily. Yan Xiu and the other two cupped their fists in acknowledgment before quickly dispersing into the surrounding forest.Song Fu immediately turned around and shouted," You still refuse to obey the Cave Master's orders and search! " Everyone cupped their hands in salute at Miao Yi, then immediately dispersed. However, Miao Yi stopped Song Fu, " Song Fu, follow me! " Song Fu was startled. He cupped his fists and acknowledged Miao Yi. Then, he followed behind Miao Yi. Just as everyone left, a silhouette that resembled a figure in the water appeared in the same spot. It was none other than the magnificent figure of Lao Bai. Lao Bai stared at the fallen stone gate, shook his head slightly, and chuckled, "" I've always been worried that you're too kind-hearted and would be easily taken advantage of…A man should have his own way of running wild. A mere boorish man can't even ascend to the heavens. Now, I'm much more at ease. " As soon as he finished speaking, his figure swayed like a wave of water. As he swayed, he quietly disappeared without a trace. The wax torch in the East Arrival Main Hall flickered its shadow. Song Fu followed behind Miao Yi and stood in the main hall one after the other. Charcoal had already stood up outside.Miao Yi seemed to have sensed something and sneezed. He stared at his throne expressionlessly, his hands clasped behind his back, facing Song Fu. He didn't say a word. The atmosphere between the two of them was a little oppressive. Song Fu waited for a while, and finally couldn't help asking," Why did Cave Master summon me? " Miao Yi asked in a gloomy tone, "Song Fu's lips curled into a mocking smile. He glanced at the dishes on the table and said indifferently, ""This was not our doing. What is Song Fu's crime?" " That's not what I'm asking! " Miao Yi suddenly turned around and stared at him. He enunciated each word coldly, "" I ordered you to guard the mountain gate, so why did you leave your post without permission? Don't tell me you don't take my orders seriously! " Song Fu thought to himself. What do you think? He didn't take them seriously in the first place. Of course, he wouldn't say that. " Song Fu has already reported this to the Cave Master. I'm really helpless.Do you think that after I report this matter, the Manor Head and Mountain Chieftain will not believe your explanation? " Song Fu chuckled and said, "" Human mouths have two skins. If Cave Master insists on framing me, then go ahead. However, Cave Master, don't forget that I also have a mouth to defend myself. I'm not a mute. " Miao Yi chuckled, "It seems like you're really unrepentant! " As soon as he said that, Yan Xiu, Dan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shaoqun appeared outside the door in a flash. They walked in together and cupped their fists at Miao Yi, saying, "" Cave Master, we haven't found anyone suspicious yet, " Miao Yi said, ""The suspicious person is right in front of us. How can we not find him?" Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun seemed to have received the secret signal and quickly closed the door. Song Fu was shocked and quickly turned around, only to see Yan Xiu, who was like a god of death, coming at him with a pair of axes. Song Fu quickly pulled out his sword and unsheathed a cold light, quickly clattering to block. Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun almost instantly took out their spears and joined forces to attack Song Fu. Yan Xiu and Song Fu's cultivation levels were about the same, and the two were evenly matched. In addition, Shan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun joined forces.Song Fu's situation instantly became precarious. " Shameless thief! " " How dare you plot against me…" Being surrounded, Song Fu was unable to escape. He was barely able to fight Yan Xiu with his sword. Before he could even finish shouting, two spears pierced through his mana defense and ruthlessly pierced into his chest. Song Fu widened his eyes and tried his best to turn back to look at Miao Yi. His lips trembled, and the anger in his eyes was indescribable. He finally understood that this was a trap.The collapse of the memorial archway was not only to frame him, but also to transfer his fellow disciples away. In order to prevent him from uniting with his fellow disciples to resist, the main purpose was to take his life.
