In the East campus? Zhou Tu hesitated for a moment. Both the senior student and the teacher had warned the new students not to go near the East campus. They didn't explain the specific reason, but from the tone of their voice, it could be heard that the East campus was very dangerous. "You have a deep misunderstanding of the East campus. In fact, it's not much different from here. It's just that the management style of the two campuses is completely different. They live in a real horror, while you live in a false happiness." Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu's eyes: "Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope because they at least know who they are and know how to be free." Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu. Whether they are students from the East campus or the West campus, they are all trapped in this school. The memories of the West campus students have been altered, repeating the life created by the black hands behind the scenes, but the students from the East campus at least know how to search for a substitute ghost and try to leave. "The students from the East campus are closer to hope?" "But I heard that only the trash from the West campus would be sent there." Zhou Tu was moved, but he still felt uneasy. "No matter what the standards are, any school that treats students like trash is definitely a trash school." Chen Ge pointed to the tall walls in the middle of the two campuses: "Do you know why that wall exists?" "Why?" "Because the school is afraid of losing control, they try to reshape human nature in various ways, but they forget that human nature is the most complex thing in the world." "What has happened will always happen, no matter how we try to forget it, the wounds left behind will always be imprinted on our hearts." "Just because we can't remember, it doesn't mean they don't exist. So, some of the school's plans are bound to fail," Chen Ge said, using language that some club members didn't understand. They didn't know why Chen Ge was saying this, but they felt like there was some truth to what he was saying. Children's curiosity is naturally heavy, and Chen Ge kept telling them the truth about the school, finally successfully arousing the interest of the club members. "Should we go there now?" "Honestly, I still can't believe that there's a studio in my dreams in the East Campus," Zhou Tu whispered. "It's not the time yet." Chen Ge looked back at his shadow, the black shadow in the 413 dormitory was still sleeping, but his body had changed greatly. If you look closely, you will find that Chen Ge's shadow is different from others, jet-black like ink, as if all light that shines there will be swallowed up. It seems to have become much stronger. The great potential of the black shadow is a good thing for Chen Ge. When he wakes up, Chen Ge will lead the students back to the East Campus to search for the lost evil spirits again. Doing so will enhance his own strength and stir up the stagnant water in the school, hiding the other "killer" in the college. "It's still a stage of accumulating strength, before the school master discovers me, this little bug, I want to prepare as much as possible for myself." Chen Ge turned to look at Wang Yicheng, he had already learned about the other three club members' stories, only the first member to join the club, the limping boy, was left: "The next place we're going to is Wang Yicheng's dormitory." "Go to my dormitory?" Wang Yicheng was a little strange when he heard this, he shook his hands repeatedly: "Forget it, there's nothing good to see in the dormitory where I live." "Your voice is higher than usual when you say this, your speech rate is faster, and your eyes are unsteady. You are really not good at lying." Chen Ge gently hugged Wang Yicheng's shoulder, "Why don't you want to let us go?" "Are you worried about what we might see?" "I..." Wang Yicheng thought for half a day and didn't know how to say it, and finally his gaze turned in another direction: "Nothing, let's go directly."  Wang Yicheng lives in room 413 of the West campus, and Lin Sisi lives in room 413 of the East campus. The room numbers are completely the same, but in room 413 of the West campus, there are students living in all the beds except for bed number four, while in the East campus, it's exactly the opposite, with only bed number four occupied and the others are empty. "Don't tell the secrets of our club to others, and try to be low-key. There are teachers in this school who are like me, and there are also some who are not easy to talk to." Chen Ge always remained vigilant. The noise they caused in the laboratory building was too loud, and the school may have already started to investigate. "I don't have much time left, after seeing room 413, I need to avoid the wind first." The male dormitory building in the West Campus has a total of four buildings, several times the number of students in the East Campus. It's not yet time to turn off the lights, and it's the busiest time for the male dormitory building. You can hear clearly the sounds of washing, the sound of plastic basin falling, and conversation standing downstairs. "This building is similar to the East Campus," Chen Ge showed a natural expression and followed four students into the first building. The small cottage where the dormitory manager lived had a closed door, but the glass window was open, and a fifty-something aunt was humming inside. She looked in a good mood. A notice was posted next to the small window, which read "It is strictly forbidden for students to use high-power electrical appliances in the dormitory and to cook in the dormitory." "I remember what was written on the East Campus dormitory notice seems to be-recently, there have been malicious cases, and students are prohibited from going out after the lights are turned off." The walls separated the two worlds, almost like the inside and outside of the "door." After passing through the corridor, Chen Ge and several club members arrived at the door of room 413. "This dormitory is no different from other dormitories," Wang Yicheng opened the door. After entering the room, it seemed as if everyone in the dormitory ignored him and was doing their own thing, and no one talked to him. After Wang Yicheng took a few steps inside, the boy sleeping next to the door on the bed suddenly threw off the mosquito net and gave him a glare, "How many times have I told you?" "Come in and close the door properly, are your legs and ears not working?" The boy's words were harsh, he didn't know why he seemed to dislike Wang Yicheng. "He didn't close the door because someone else is coming in. If you need an apology, we can apologize on his behalf, we just don't know what kind of apology you need?" Chen Ge grabbed the door handle and entered the room, scanning the other people in the dormitory. The mosquito net boy was intimidated when he saw Chen Ge, he didn't speak and put the mosquito net back down with a dark face. "Teacher Bai, this is bed number four, since no one is living here, we use it to store our luggage." Wang Yicheng pointed to bed number four, which was covered in several luggage boxes. Only his luggage was stored under his own bed, while others threw their clutter and luggage on bed number four. Chen Ge was very familiar with bed number four, he had slept on bed number four in the East Campus. Walking to bed number four, the bed was empty but still had sheets and a quilt, only the bedding was now dirty from the luggage and clutter.
