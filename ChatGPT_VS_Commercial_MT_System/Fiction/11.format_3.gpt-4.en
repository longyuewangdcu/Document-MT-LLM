"At the East Campus?" Zhou Tu hesitated for a moment. Both seniors and teachers had warned the freshmen not to go near the East Campus. They didn't specify the reasons, but from their tone, it was clear that the East Campus was dangerous. "You all have a deep misunderstanding of the East Campus. It's actually not much different from here; it's just that the management styles of the two campuses are completely different. They live in real terror, while you live in false happiness." Chen Ge looked into Zhou Tu's eyes: "Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope because they at least know who they are and how to find a way out." Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu. Whether it was the East Campus or the West Campus students, they were all trapped in this school. The memories of the West Campus students were altered, and they were living a life created by the hidden mastermind. At least the East Campus students knew to look for scapegoats and tried to find ways to leave. "The students at the East Campus are closer to hope?" "But I heard that only the unwanted trash from the West Campus would be sent there." Zhou Tu was already persuaded, but he still felt a little uneasy. "No matter what the judging criteria are, any school that treats students as trash is definitely a garbage school." Chen Ge pointed to the tall wall between the two campuses: "Do you know why that wall exists?" "Why?" "Because the school is afraid of losing control. They use various methods to reshape human nature, but they forget that human nature is the most complicated thing in this world." "Things have happened, and no matter how we try to forget, the wounds will always be imprinted in our hearts." "Not remembering anything doesn't mean they don't exist, so some plans of this school are bound to fail." Chen Ge said some words that the club members couldn't understand. They didn't know why Chen Ge was speaking like this, but they felt that what he said seemed to make some sense. Children's curiosity is heavy, and Chen Ge kept telling them the truth about the school, eventually arousing the interest of the club members. "Shall we go now?" "To be honest, I don't really believe that there will be the art studio of my dreams in the East Campus," Zhou Tu whispered. "Now is not the time." Chen Ge looked back at the shadow. The dark figure in dormitory 413 was still asleep, but its body had undergone significant changes. If you look closely, Chen Ge's shadow was different from others, as dark as ink, as if all the light shining on it would be swallowed up. It seemed to have become much stronger. The enormous potential of the dark figure was a good thing for Chen Ge. When it woke up, Chen Ge would lead the students back to the East Campus to target the lone ghosts again. Doing so would both enhance his own strength and stir up the stagnant water in the school, providing cover for another "culprit" within the academy. "Now is still the stage of accumulating strength. Before the school master discovers this little bug of mine, I need to prepare as many cards as possible for myself." Chen Ge turned to look at Wang Yicheng. He had learned about the stories of the other three club members, and now only this limping boy who joined the club first was left: "Our next destination is Wang Yicheng's dormitory." "Go to my dormitory?" Wang Yicheng reacted strangely after hearing this and waved his hands repeatedly: "Forget it, there's nothing worth seeing in the dormitory I live in." "Your voice is higher than usual when you say this, your speaking speed has increased, and your eyes are evasive. You really aren't good at lying, kid." Chen Ge gently put his arm around Wang Yicheng's shoulder: "Why don't you want us to go there?" "Are you worried that we will see something?" "I..." Wang Yicheng thought for a long time and didn't know what to say. In the end, he looked in another direction: "It's nothing. Let's just go there directly." "Alright." Wang Yicheng lived in room 413 of the West Campus, while Lin Sisi lived in room 413 of the East Campus. The dormitory numbers were exactly the same, but in the West Campus' 413 dormitory, there were students living on all the beds except for bed number four. In the East Campus, on the contrary, only bed number four was occupied, and the other beds were empty. "Don't tell anyone about the secrets within our club. Everyone should try to keep a low profile. There are teachers like me in this school, but there are also teachers who are not so easy to deal with." Chen Ge was always on guard. The commotion they caused in the laboratory building was too big, and the school might have already started an investigation. "I don't have much time left. After visiting room 413, we need to lay low for a while." The West Campus has a total of four male dormitory buildings, with several times the number of students compared to the East Campus. The lights have not been turned off yet, and it's the liveliest time for the male dormitory buildings. The sounds of washing, plastic basins falling, and conversations can be heard clearly from the ground floor. "This building is quite similar to the one in the East Campus," Chen Ge appeared very natural, following the four students into the first building. The dormitory supervisor's small room was tightly closed, but the glass window was open. Inside, a woman in her fifties was humming a song, looking in a good mood. Next to the small window, there was a notice stating that students were strictly prohibited from using high-power electrical appliances in the dormitory and were not allowed to cook in the dormitory. "I remember that the notice in the East Campus dormitory building said something like â€“ due to recent malicious incidents, students are prohibited from going out after lights-out." Separated by a wall, it's almost like two different worlds, just like the inside and outside of the "gate." Passing through the corridor, Chen Ge and the club members arrived at the door of dormitory 413. "This dormitory is no different from the others," Wang Yicheng opened the door. After entering the room, the other people in the same dormitory acted as if he didn't exist, doing their own things, and no one spoke to him. As Wang Yicheng walked a few steps inside, the male student sleeping next to the door suddenly lifted the mosquito net and glared at him: "How many times have I said it?" "Close the door behind you when you come in. Your leg is lame, but are your ears also not working?" The male student's words were very unpleasant, and it was unclear why he seemed to dislike Wang Yicheng so much. "He didn't close the door because there are more people coming in behind him. If you need an apology, the rest of us can apologize on his behalf. We just don't know what kind of apology you need," Chen Ge, holding the doorknob, entered the room and glanced at the other people in the dormitory. Seeing Chen Ge, the mosquito net man immediately backed down, said nothing, and sullenly pulled the mosquito net back up. "Mr. Bai, this is bed number four. Since no one lives here, we use it to store our luggage," Wang Yicheng pointed to bed number four, which had a few suitcases thrown on it. In this dormitory, only his luggage was placed under his own bed, while the others had thrown their belongings and luggage on bed number four. Chen Ge was very familiar with bed number four as he had lain on it in the East Campus. Approaching bed number four, although no one lived there, it was covered with bedding and sheets. However, those beddings were now dirtied by the luggage and clutter.
