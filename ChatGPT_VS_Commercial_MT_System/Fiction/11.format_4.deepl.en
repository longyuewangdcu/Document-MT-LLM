"In the East Campus?" Zhou Tu obviously hesitated, both the seniors and teachers had warned the new students not to go near the East Campus, they didn't state the exact reason, but from the tone of their words they were able to hear that the East Campus was dangerous. "You have a deep misunderstanding of the East Campus, it's actually similar to here, except that the two campuses are managed in a completely different way, they live in real horror, while you live in false happiness." Chen Ge looked into Zhou Tu's eyes, "Compared to you guys, they are actually closer to hope, because they at least know who they are and know the way to get rid of it." Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu, whether it was the students from the East Campus or the West Campus, they were all trapped in this school. The students of the west campus had their memories modified and repeated the life made by the mastermind behind the curtain, while the students of the east campus at least knew how to find a scapegoat and find a way to leave. "The students of the East School are closer to hope?" "But I've heard that only the unwanted trash from the West Campus are sent there." Zhou Tu had been spoken to, but he was still a little unsure of himself. "No matter what the judging criteria is, any school that treats its students like trash, then that school must be a trash school." Chen Ge reached out and pointed to the high wall in the middle of the two campuses, "Do you know why that wall exists?" "Why?" "Because the school is afraid of getting out of control, they are trying to reshape humanity through various methods, but they forget that humanity is the most complicated thing in this world." "It has happened, and no matter how one tries to forget, the wounds left behind will always be branded on the heart." "Not remembering anything doesn't mean they don't exist, so certain plans for this school are doomed to fail." Chen Ge said something that the club members could not understand, they did not know why Chen Ge said this, but felt that what Chen Ge said seemed to have some truth to it. The children's curiosity itself was heavy, and Chen Ge kept telling them the truth about this school, and finally succeeded in arousing the interest of the club members. "So we'll go there now?" "To be honest, I really don't believe that there will be the painting studio of my dreams in the east campus," Zhou Tu whispered. "Now is not the time." Chen Ge looked back at the shadow, the black shadow in dormitory 413 was still sleeping, but his body had changed a lot. If you look carefully you will see that Chen Ge's shadow is different from the others, as dark as ink, as if all light shining there will be swallowed up. It seems to have become much stronger. The black shadow has great potential this is a good thing for Chen Ge, when he wakes up, Chen Ge will lead the students back to the East Campus to look for the single harsh ghosts to strike again. This will strengthen their own strength, and can muddy the school's stagnant water to cover another "killer" in the college. "Now is still the stage of accumulating power, before the school master found me this little worm, I want to prepare as much as possible for myself some cards." Chen Ge turned his head to look at Wang Yicheng, the other three club members whose stories he knew, leaving only the lame boy who was the first to join the club: "The next place we're going to is Wang Yicheng's dormitory." "To my dormitory?" Wang Yicheng reacted a bit strangely after hearing this, he waved his hand: "Better forget it, there's nothing to see in that dormitory I live in." "Your voice was higher than usual when you said this, your speech speed became faster, and your eyes fluttered, you're really not good at lying as a kid." Chen Ge gently put his arm around Wang Yicheng's shoulder: "Why don't you want us to go over there?" "What are you worried about us seeing?" "I ......" Wang Yicheng thought for half a day but didn't know what to say, finally his gaze turned to other directions, "Nothing, let's go straight over." "Good." Wang Yicheng lived in dormitory 413 on the west campus, and Lin Sisi lived in dormitory 413 on the east campus. The dormitory numbers are exactly the same, but the 413 dormitory on the west campus has students living in all the beds except bed number four, while the east campus is just the opposite, only bed number four has people living in it, and all the other beds are empty. "Don't tell others the secrets in our club, everyone try to keep a low profile, there are teachers like me in this school and teachers who are not so nice to talk to." Chen Ge was always on alert, the commotion they made in the lab building was so big that the school authorities had probably started investigating. "There's not much time left for me to get out of the way after visiting dorm room 413." There are four male dormitory buildings on the west campus, and the number of students is several times that of the east campus. Now that the lights are not out, it is the most lively time for the male dormitory buildings, and the sound of washing, the sound of falling plastic pots, and the sound of conversation can be heard clearly when standing downstairs. "This building is similar to the East Campus." Chen Ge acted very naturally and followed the four students into the first building together. The door of the hut where the resident manager lived was closed, but the glass window was open, and there was an older woman in her fifties humming inside, she looked in a good mood. A notice was posted next to the small window, which stated that it was strictly forbidden for students to use high-powered electrical appliances in the dormitory and forbade students to cook for themselves in the dormitory. "I remember the announcement on the dormitory building on the east campus said something like - there are vicious cases happening recently and students are forbidden to go out after lights out." A wall is almost like two worlds, like the "door" inside and the "door" outside. Walking through the corridor, Chen Ge and a few club members arrived at the entrance of dormitory 413. "This dormitory is no different from other dormitories." Wang Yicheng opened the door, and when he entered the room, the other people in the dormitory seemed to treat him as if he didn't exist, doing their own things, and none of them talked to him. When Wang Yicheng took a few steps inside, the boy sleeping in the bed next to the door suddenly lifted the mosquito net and glared at him: "How many times did I say?" "Come in and close the door with your hands, you are lame, are your ears also bad?" The boy spoke very hard, he did not know why he seemed to hate Wang Yicheng. "He didn't close the door because there were people coming in behind him, if you need an apology, a few of us can apologize to you for him, I just don't know which form of apology you need?" Chen Ge grabbed the door handle and entered the room, he swept a glance at the other people in the dormitory. The mosquito net man saw Chen Ge and instantly wimped out, didn't say anything, and re-drew the mosquito net shut with a black face. "Teacher Bai, this is bed number four, because no one lives there, so we use it to put our luggage." Wang Yicheng pointed to bed number four, on which several suitcases were thrown, only his luggage in this dormitory was placed under his own bed, everyone else threw miscellaneous items and luggage onto bed number four. Chen Ge was familiar with the fourth bed, he himself had lain on the fourth bed in the East Campus. He walked to bed number four, which was unoccupied but had bedding and sheets, except that the bedding was now soiled by luggage and miscellaneous items.
