"In the East Campus?" Zhou Tu obviously hesitated. Both the seniors and the teacher had warned the freshmen and do not approach the East Campus. They did not explain the specific reason, but they could hear the danger of the East Campus from the tone of their speech.	 Essence	 "You have deep misunderstandings about the East Campus. It is actually similar to here, but the management methods of the two campuses are completely different. They live in real horror, and you live in false happiness." Chen Ge looked at Zhou.	 The eyes of the picture: "Compared to you, in fact, they are closer to hope, because they know at least who they are and the way they are liberated." Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu, whether it is the East Campus or the students of the West Campus, they are all trapped in trapped	 In this school.	 Students in the Western Campus remember to be modified and repeated the life produced by the black hands behind the scenes. The students in the East Campus also knew to find a dead ghost and tried to leave.	 "The students of the East School are closer to hope?" "But I heard that only the unwanted garbage from the West Campus will be sent there." Zhou Tu had been said, but he was still a little unsatisfactory.	 "No matter what the judgment standard is, any school that treats students as garbage, then this school must be a junk school." Chen Ge extended his finger at the high wall in the middle of the two campuses: "Do you know why the wall is existed?" "Why?" "Because the school is afraid of getting out of control, they can reshape human nature through various methods, but they	 Forgot that human nature is the most complicated thing in the world. "" Things have happened. No matter how you forget, the wound left by the wound will always be imprinted in your heart. "	 Some plans are destined to fail. "Chen Ge said that some members of the community did not understand. They didn't know why Chen Ge said so, but felt that Chen Ge said that there was some reason.	 The child's curiosity itself is important, and Chen Ge constantly tells them the truth of the school, and finally successfully aroused the interest of members of the community.	 "Then we will pass now?" "To be honest, I really don't believe it, there will be a studio in the East Campus," Zhou Tu whispered.	 "It's not the time yet." Chen Ge looked back at the shadow. The dark shadow in the 413 dormitory was still asleep, but his body had changed a lot.	 If you look closely, you will find that the shadow of Chen Ge is different from the shadow of others. It is dark as ink, as if all the light will be swallowed there.	 It seems to have become stronger.	 The huge potential of Black Shadow is a good thing for Chen Ge. When he wakes up, Chen Ge will lead the students to return to the East Campus to find a strong ghost who placed orders.	 Doing this can enhance your strength. On the other hand, you can stir up the dead water of the school and cover another "murderer" in the college.	 "It is still a stage of accumulation power. Before the master of the school discovered that I was the little bug, I had to prepare some cards for myself as much as possible." Chen Ge turned to Wang Yicheng, and he had the stories of the other three members of the community.	 After understanding, there is only this lame boy who entered the society first: "The next place we are going to go is Wang Yicheng's dormitory." "Go to my dormitory?" Wang Yicheng reacted a strange response after hearing, he waved his hand again: "Still count, count,	 Let's have nothing to look at the dormitory I live. "" When you say this, the voice is higher than usual, the speed of speech becomes faster, and the eyes are erratic. You child is really not good at lying. " Chen Ge gently holding Wang Yicheng's shoulder: "Why don't you want to let us pass?" "What are you worried about what we see?" "I ..." Wang Yicheng thought about what to say for a long time, and finally turned to other directions:	 "Nothing, let's go directly." "Okay." Wang Yicheng lived in the 413 bedroom in the West Campus, and Lin Sisi lived in the 413 bedroom in the East Campus.	 The bedroom number is exactly the same, but in addition to the No. 4 bed in the 413 bedroom of the West Campus, there are students in other beds, while the Eastern Campus is exactly the opposite. Only the No. 4 bed lives, and the other beds are empty.	 "Don't tell others the secrets in our clubs. Everyone should be as low as possible. There are teachers like me in this school, as well as teachers who are not so good." Chen Ge kept alert at all times.	 Large, the school is likely to start investigation.	 "I don't have much time to leave me. After watching the 413 bedroom, you need to avoid the limelight." There are four boys dormitory buildings in the Western Campus. The number of students is several times that of the East Campus. It has not yet turned off the lights. It is the most lively when the boy's bedroom building is the most lively.	 You can hear clearly downstairs.	 "This building is similar to the East Campus." Chen Ge performed very naturally and entered the first building with four students.	 The door of the hut living in the cottage was closed, but the glass window was opened. There was a fifty -year -old aunt who was humming. She looked in a good mood.	 There is an announcement next to the small window, which says that students are strictly prohibited from using high -power electrical appliances in the dormitory, and students are prohibited from cooking in the dormitory.	 "I remember what it seemed to be written on the announcement of the dormitory building of the East Campus -recently vicious cases have occurred, and students are prohibited from going out after the lights are turned off." One wall is almost two worlds, just like the "door" and the "door" outside the "door".	 Essence	 Through the corridor, Chen Ge and several members of the community came to the door of the 413 dormitory.	 "This dormitory is no different from other dormitories." Wang Yicheng opened the door. After he entered the house, everyone in the same bedroom seemed to be as if he did not exist, doing his own thing, and no one talked to him. After Wang Yicheng took a few steps in, the boy who slept next to the door of the door suddenly opened the mosquito net and stared at him: "How many times did you say?"	 Make? "The boy was hard to hear, he didn't know why he seemed to hate Wang Yicheng.	 "He didn't close the door because there were still people who came in. If you need to apologize, some of us can apologize for him, but I don't know which form of apology do you need?" Chen Ge grabbed the door handle and entered the house. He swept it.	 At a glance at the others in the bedroom.	 When the mosquito net man saw Chen Ge, he suddenly counseled and didn't speak, and he pulled up the mosquito net again with a black face.	 "Teacher Bai, this is the fourth bed, because no one lives, so we are used to put luggage." Wang Yicheng pointed at the No. 4 bed and threw a few suitcases on it. In this bedroom	 Under their own bed, others threw the debris and luggage onto the No. 4 bed.	 Chen Ge was very familiar with the No. 4 bed, and he lay on the No. 4 bed in the East Campus.	 When I walked next to the No. 4 bed, although this bed was not living, she was paved with bedding and sheets, but those bedding was now soiled by luggage and debris.
