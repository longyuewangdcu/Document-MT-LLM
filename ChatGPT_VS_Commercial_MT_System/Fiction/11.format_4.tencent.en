" In the east campus? " Zhou Tu hesitated. Both the seniors and teachers had warned the freshmen not to go near the east campus. They did not explain the reason, but from their tone, it was clear that the east campus was dangerous." Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope because at least they know who they are and how to escape. " Chen Ge did not lie to Zhou Tu. Regardless of whether it was the students from the east campus or the west campus, they were all trapped in this school. The memories of the students from the west campus had been altered to repeat the life created by the mastermind, but the students from the east campus still knew how to find a scapegoat." But I heard that only the unwanted trash from the west campus will be sent there. " Zhou Tu had already been persuaded, but he was still a little uneasy. " No matter what the criteria are, any school that treats its students as trash must be a trash school. " Chen Ge pointed at the high wall between the two campuses. "" Do you know why that wall exists? " " Why? " " Because the school is afraid of losing control. They use all kinds of methods to reshape human nature, but they forget that human nature is the most complicated thing in the world. " " Things have already happened. No matter how hard you try to forget them, the wounds left behind will always be imprinted on your heart. " " Just because you don't remember anything doesn't mean they don't exist." So, some of the plans of this school are bound to fail. " Chen Ge said something that the members did not understand. They did not know why Chen Ge said that, but they felt that Chen Ge's words made sense. Children were curious, and Chen Ge kept telling them the truth about this school. In the end, it managed to pique the members 'interest."There will be a studio in my dream on the east campus," Zhou whispered."Not yet." Chen Ge turned around to look at the shadow. The shadow in Room 413 was still sleeping, but his body had changed greatly. If one looked closely, they would realize that Chen Ge's shadow was different from the others. It was as black as ink, as if all light that fell on it would be devoured. It seemed to have become much stronger. The shadow's potential was huge, which was a good thing for Chen Ge. When he woke up, Chen Ge's body would be completely different.Chen Ge would lead the students back to the eastern campus to find the lone Specter again. This would increase his strength, and it would also stir up the school's stagnant waters to cover up the other 'murder'. " Right now, I'm still in the stage of accumulating my strength. Before the school master discovers this little bug, I need to prepare as many trump cards as possible for myself. " Chen Ge turned to look at Wang Yicheng. He already knew the story of the other three members.Only the crippled boy who had joined the club first was left:The next place we're going to is Wang Yicheng's dormitory. "" Forget it. There's nothing to see in the dormitory I live in. When you said that, your voice was higher than usual. You spoke faster, and your eyes were erratic. You're really not good at lying. " Chen Ge gently put his arm around Wang Yicheng's shoulder. ""Why don't you want us to go over? Are you worried that we will see something?""I…" Wang Yicheng thought for a long time but didn't know what to say." It's nothing. Let's head over directly. " " Okay. " Wang Yicheng lived in Dormitory 413 on the west campus, while Lin Sisi lived in Dormitory 413 on the east campus. The dorm numbers were the same, but apart from bed four, all the other beds in Dormitory 413 on the west campus were occupied by students. On the east campus, it was the opposite. Only bed four was occupied, and the other beds were empty. " Don't tell anyone the secrets of our club. Everyone should try to keep a low profile. There are teachers like me in this school." There are also teachers who are not easy to talk to. " Chen Ge was on guard at all times. The commotion they caused in the laboratory building was too big, and the school might have started investigating. " I don't have much time left. After I go to Room 413, I need to stay out of the way for now. " " This building is similar to the east campus. " Chen Ge acted very naturally as he followed the four students into the first building. The door to the dormitory was tightly shut, but the glass window was open.  Inside, a middle-aged woman in her fifties was humming a song. She seemed to be in a good mood. There was a notice posted next to the small window, which said that students were strictly prohibited from using high-power appliances in the dormitory and were prohibited from cooking by themselves. " I remember that the notice on the dormitory building in the east campus seemed to say that there was a serious case recently, and students were prohibited from going out after lights were turned off. " It was almost two worlds separated by a wall, just like the inside and outside of the door. Walking through the corridor," This room is no different from the other rooms. " Wang Yicheng opened the door. After he entered the room, the other roommates acted as if he did not exist. They were minding their own business. No one spoke to him. After Wang Yicheng took a few steps inside, the boy sleeping on the bed next to the door suddenly lifted the mosquito net and glared at him." He did not close the door because there are people coming in from behind. If you need to apologize, we can apologize on his behalf, but I wonder what kind of apology you want? " Chen Ge grabbed the doorknob and entered the room. He glanced at the other people in the room. The man with the mosquito net was terrified when he saw Chen Ge." Mr. Bai, this is bed number four. Since there was no one staying here, we used it to store our luggage. " Wang Yicheng pointed at bed number four. There were a few suitcases on the bed. In this room, only his luggage was under his bed. The others had all thrown their belongings onto bed number four. Chen Ge was very familiar with bed number four. He had slept on bed number four on the east campus before. When he walked to bed number four, although there was no one living on the bed, he could see that it was empty.But there were bedding and sheets, only the bedding was now soiled by luggage and clutter.
