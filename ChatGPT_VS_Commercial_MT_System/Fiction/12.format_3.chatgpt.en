"Zhuque." Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan, who was looking at the playful White Xiaochen and Little Dragon, suddenly heard a loud noise coming from outside. Her eyebrows frowned slightly, "What happened outside? Why is there a loud noise?" "Go out and see." Zhuque made a fist and retreated, after half a sound, she pushed open the door of the bamboo house and walked in, hesitantly saying, "Queen, there are two people outside who are looking for you..." "Looking for me?" Bai Yan raised her eyebrows, "Then I will go out and see who it is." As she spoke, she stood up from her chair and walked towards the door. Outside the house, under the blood-red sky, two people tremblingly crawled from the front, perhaps because they had climbed too much, causing a bloodstain to flow under their bodies and falling into Bai Yan's eyes, especially dazzling. "What are you doing?" Bai Yan frowned, and asked in a cold voice. The elder's face was pale and his shaking body was crawling on the ground. He stuttered, Queen, I am here to apologize to you. It was my mistake to believe that fake person, which led to your misunderstanding of the king. All of this is my fault. I am willing to be beaten and scolded. Please forgive me, Queen." "No, Queen, it's my fault. I didn't bring the king's orders to you. In fact, the king left the palace to lift the seal on the evil world, and he asked me to come back to inform you. I failed to do so, giving the traitor an opportunity." Fire Feather knelt on the ground, tears all over his face. "No matter how many mistakes I have made, it's all my fault. Queen, if you want to beat me or scold me, I won't object." He took the bamboo stick behind him and put his palms together, offering it to the white-faced woman. He lowered his head deeply, looking like he was facing death. The white-faced woman slowly grasped the bamboo stick that Fire Feather had brought to her. Her expression was calm and her gaze was full of light that was impossible to understand. As soon as she felt the stick leave her hand, Fire Feather's body stiffened. He tightly clenched his teeth and waited for that devastating blow. But... it was a long time before he felt any pain. Fire Feather looked up in surprise and saw that the bamboo stick in the white-faced woman's hand had burst into flames, burning to ashes in an instant. "Did you suffer a lot on the way here?" "Queen... Queen?" Huoyu gazed at Bai Yan, unsure of what she meant. "If that's the case, then your sin has been redeemed, get up," Bai Yan always acted in a clear and authoritative manner for the company. Her target was only those who foolishly tried to harm her. Even if she was once deceived, how could she be deceived by the elders and Huoyu? Therefore, she never held a grudge against them... Huoyu's body stiffened like iron, unable to believe that Bai Yan had let them go so easily. Before coming, they had prepared themselves for a full body of injuries! Now, she hasn't even punished them, and she has already absolved their sin. Seeing the two of them kneeling stiffly on the ground without moving, Bai Yan's face darkened slightly: "What?" "Are you waiting for me to help you up?" The woman's harsh voice fell into Huoyu's ears, startling him, and he immediately crawled up from the ground. His pants legs were covered in blood, and he couldn't stand steady. Even so, he still stood on the ground, despite his legs constantly trembling, and didn't continue to kneel. White Face looked at the two people who were unable to support themselves and pointed to the stone seat on the ground: "Sit down, rest for a while and you can go down the mountain."
