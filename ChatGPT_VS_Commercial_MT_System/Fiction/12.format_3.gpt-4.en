"Suzaku." Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan was watching Bai Xiaochen and Little Dragon playing around. Suddenly, she heard some noisy sounds coming from outside. She furrowed her brows slightly, "What's happening outside? Why is there such noise?" "You go and take a look." Suzaku clenched her fists and left with the command. After a short while, she pushed open the door of the bamboo house and walked in, hesitating, "Your Majesty, there are two people outside, looking for you..." "Looking for me?" Bai Yan raised her eyebrows, "Then I'll go and see who's looking for me." With that, she slowly stood up from her chair and headed towards the door. Outside the house, under the blood-red sky, two people shakily crawled over from the front. Perhaps they had crawled too much, as a trail of blood flowed beneath them. It caught Bai Yan's eyes, appearing particularly glaring. "What are you doing?" Bai Yan's eyebrows slightly furrowed, and she asked coldly. The Second Elder's face was pale, and his trembling body lay prostrate on the ground. He stuttered, "Your Majesty, I came to apologize and atone for my mistakes. That day, I was too gullible and believed the imposter, causing you to misunderstand the king. It was all my fault. I'm willing to accept any scolding or punishment; please assign the penalty." "No, Your Majesty, it was my fault. I failed to deliver the king's order to you. In fact, that day, the king left the palace to lift the seal of the demon realm. He asked me to inform you, but I failed to do so, thus giving the traitor a chance to take advantage." Huoyu knelt on the ground, his face covered with tears, "It's all my fault, a thousand times over. If Your Majesty wishes to hit or scold me, I will not say a word in protest." He took the bamboo stick from behind him, held it with both hands, and presented it to Bai Yan. He bowed his head deeply, his face showing determination in the face of death. Bai Yan's hand slowly grasped the bamboo stick that Huoyu had brought before her. Her expression was calm, and her eyes revealed an incomprehensible light. Sensing that the bamboo stick had left his hand, Huoyu's body stiffened. He clenched his teeth tightly, waiting for the strike that seemed to be as unstoppable as a breaking bamboo. However... for a long time, the pain never came. Huoyu looked up in astonishment, only to see a flame emerging from the bamboo stick in Bai Yan's hand, which instantly burned it to ashes. "You must have suffered a lot crawling all this way, right?" "Your... Your Majesty?" Huoyu looked at Bai Yan in confusion, not understanding the meaning of her words. "In that case, you have already atoned for your sins. Stand up." Bai Yan had always been a fair and just person. She only targeted those who sought to harm her. If she could be deceived that day, how could the Grand Elder and Huoyu not be? Therefore, she had never blamed them... Huoyu's body was as stiff as iron, unable to believe that Bai Yan would let them off so easily. Before they came, they had prepared themselves for injuries all over their bodies! Yet now, she didn't even hit them once and absolved them of their sins. Seeing the two of them still kneeling on the ground without moving, Bai Yan's face darkened slightly, "What's the matter? Are you waiting for me to help you up?" The sharp sound of her voice fell into Huoyu's ears, startling him. He immediately got up from the ground, his pant legs covered in blood, unable to stand steadily. Even so, he remained standing, even though his legs were trembling continuously, and he did not kneel again. Bai Yan looked at the two of them, both struggling to stand, and pointed to the stone seats on the ground, "Sit down, take a rest for a while, and then you can go down the mountain."
