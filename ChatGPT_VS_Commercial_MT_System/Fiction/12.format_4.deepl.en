"Zhuque." Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan was looking at Bai Xiaochen and Little Dragon's who were playing and playing, when she suddenly heard a noisy sound coming from outside, and her willow eyebrows frowned lightly, "What's going on outside? Why is there a noisy sound?" "You go out and take a look." Vermilion Bird arched her fist and led the order to retreat, half a sound later, she pushed open the door of the bamboo house and walked in, saying hesitantly, "Queen, there are two people outside, they are here to find you ......" "Looking for me? " Bai Yan raised her eyebrows, "Then I will go out and see who is looking for me." The words fell, she slowly stood up from the chair and headed for the door. Outside the house, under the bloody sky, two people trembled and crawled from the front, perhaps crawling too much, resulting in a blood trail dripping under their bodies, falling into Bai Yan's eyes, extraordinarily blinding. "What are you doing here?" Bai Yan frowned lightly and asked in a cold voice. The second elder's face was pale, his trembling body prostrated on the ground, shivering and saying, "Queen, I have come to ask for your sins, that day, it was my gullibility in trusting that impostor that made the queen misunderstand the king, everything is my fault, I am willing to be beaten and scolded at will, please forgive the queen." "No, Queen, it is my fault, I did not bring the king's order to you, in fact, that day the king left the palace to lift the seal of the demon world, he asked me to come back to inform the queen, I was not able to do so, which gave the treacherous person an opportunity to take advantage of." Fire feather kneeled on the ground, face full of tears: "A thousand mistakes are my fault, the queen wants to beat and scold, I will never say anything." He took the bamboo strip behind him into his hands, two palms, handed it to Bai Yan, deeply lowered his head, a face like death. Bai Yan's hand, slowly holding the bamboo strip dragged to the front of the fire feather, her expression is bland, her gaze through the light that people can not read. It seems to perceive the bamboo strip away from the hand, the body of the fire feather stiffened, he clenched his teeth, waiting for that momentum like a broken strike. But ...... for a long time, there was no pain coming. The fire feather stunned tilted his head, but saw the bamboo strip in Bai Yan's hand emerged a burst of flame, instantly burned to ashes. "You guys crawled all the way here, suffered a lot?" "The king ...... queen?" Fire Feather looked at Bai Yan in uncertainty, perhaps not understanding what she meant by this. "Since this is the case, then your sins have been repaid, get up." Bai Yan has never been a person with a clear-cut company. The only people she targeted were those who presumed to harm her. That day, she could be deceived, let alone the Grand Elder and Fire Feather? So, she never complained about them ...... Fire Feather's body stiffened like iron, unable to believe that Bai Yan let them off so easily? Before coming, they were ready to be bruised all over! Now, she didn't even whip them a bit, and eliminated their sin. Seeing these two people frozen on their knees and not moving, Bai Yan's face sank slightly: "What?" "You are still waiting for me to help you up?" The woman's harsh voice fell into Fire Feather's ears, startled Fire Feather immediately crawled up from the ground, his trouser legs were covered with blood, he could not even stand up steadily. Even so, he still stood on the ground, even if his legs and feet have been shivering, but did not continue to kneel down. Bai Yan looked at these two people are difficult to support, pointed to the stone seat on the ground: "Sit, rest for a while you can go down the mountain."
