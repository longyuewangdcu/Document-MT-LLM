"Suzaku." Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan was looking at Bai Xiaochen and Xiaolonger who was playing and playing. Suddenly, she heard a noisy voice outside, and Liu Mei frowned: "What happened outside? Why is there no noise?	 "You go out and see." Suzaku arched his fist and retreated. After half a noise, she pushed the door of the bamboo house and walked in. He hesitant: "Queen, there are two people outside, come to you to find you.	 ... "" Looking for me? "Bai Yan raised his eyebrows," Then I go out and see, who came to me. "When he fell, she stood slowly from the chair and walked out of the door.	 Outside the house, under the bloody sky, the two climbed from the front, perhaps there were too many ways to climb, causing a bloodstain to flow under the eyes of Bai Yan, and it was particularly eye -catching.	 "What are you doing?" Bai Yan frowned and asked coldly. The second elder's face was pale, his trembling body stunned to the ground, and said, "Queen, I came to ask you to ask you to sin. On the same day, I believed in the counterfeit goods, so that the queen misunderstood the king. Everything was mine.	 Wrong, I am willing to do it and scold, and ask the queen to sin. "" No, the queen is my fault. I did not bring you the order of the king to you. In fact, the king left the palace for the release of the seal of the demon world.	 He asked me back to inform the queen. I did not be able to do it, and then gave the adulterer organic. "Huo Yu kneeling on the ground, tears on his face:" Marigation mistakes are my fault, and the queen wants to fight	 I want to scold, I have no words. "He took the bamboo strips behind him, supported each other with both palms, and handed it to Bai Yan, deeply lowered his head, and his face was as dead as his face.	 Bai Yan's hand slowly held the bamboo strip of Huo Yu to drag in front of her. Her expression was indifferent, and her eyes were unspeakable.	 It seemed that he noticed that the bamboo strip left his hand, Huo Yu's body froze, and he tightly gritted his teeth, waiting for a blow that was like a bamboo.	 But ... for a long time, there was no pain.	 Huo Yu stunned his head, but saw a flame in the bamboo strip in Bai Yan's hand, and instantly burned for ashes.	 "You climbing this way and suffered a lot of sins?" "King ... Queen?" Fire Yu looked at Bai Yan unknown, Xu did not understand what she meant.	 "That's it, then your sin has been repaid, let's get up." Bai Yan has always been a company with a clear company.	 What she targets is only those who want to harm her.	 On the same day, she could be deceived, let alone the elder and the fire feathers?	 Therefore, she never complained about them ... Huo Yu's body was as stiff as iron, and couldn't believe that Bai Yan let them go so easily?	 Before coming, they were ready to be bruised all over the body!	 Now that she didn't even smoke them, she eliminated their sins.	 Seeing the two people kneeling on the ground without moving, Bai Yan's face sank slightly: "How?" "You are waiting for me to help you get up?" The woman's sharp voice fell into the fire feathers' ears	 It was surprised that Huo Yu immediately got up from the ground. His trousers were all blood on his legs, and he couldn't stand firmly. That's it. He was still standing on the ground, even if his legs kept snoring, and he didn't continue to kneel.	 Bai Yan glanced at both of them, and pointed at the stone seat on the ground: "Sit, take a break for a while, you can go down the mountain."
