" Vermillion Bird. " Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan was looking at Bai Xiaochen and Little Dragon 'er who were playing around. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise coming from outside and her beautiful brows furrowed slightly."What's going on outside? Why is there a commotion? Go out and take a look." The Vermilion Bird cupped her fists and withdrew. After a while, she pushed open the door of the bamboo house and walked in." Queen, there are two people outside. They're here to look for you…" " Looking for me? " Bai Yan raised her eyebrows. " Then I'll go out and see who's looking for me. " As she finished speaking, she slowly stood up from her chair and walked out of the door. Outside, under the blood-colored sky, the two of them were crawling over in front of them. Perhaps it was because they had crawled too many paths, causing a bloody trail to drip down their bodies. When it fell into Bai Yan's eyes, it was exceptionally glaring. The Second Elder's face was pale, and his trembling body prostrated on the ground as he said, "" No, Queen, it's my fault. I didn't bring the King's order to you. In fact, the King left the palace to remove the seal of the Demon Realm. He asked me to come back and inform the Queen, but I didn't do it. That's why the traitor had an opportunity. " Huo Yu knelt on the ground, his face full of tears." A thousand mistakes are all my fault. If the Queen wants to beat me or scold me, I will not say anything. " He took the bamboo stick behind him and placed it in front of Bai Yan with his two palms supporting each other. He lowered his head deeply and had a face that was unafraid of death. Bai Yan's hand slowly grabbed the bamboo stick that Huo Yu had dragged in front of her. Her expression was indifferent, and her eyes revealed an incomprehensible light. As if she had sensed that the bamboo stick had left her hand, Huo Yu's body froze. He clenched his teeth tightly.Huo Yu looked up in shock, only to see a burst of flames emerge from the bamboo stick in Bai Yan's hand, instantly burning into ashes. " Since that's the case, then your sins have already been repaid. Get up. " Bai Yan had always been someone who was clear about the company. She only targeted those who had the delusion of harming her. She had been deceived that day, let alone the Great Elder and Huo Yu? Therefore, she had never blamed them…Huo Yu's body was as stiff as iron. He did not dare to believe that Bai Yan would let them off so easily? Before coming here, she had never thought that she would be able to do so.They were already prepared to be covered in bruises! Now, she had not even slapped them, but she had eliminated their sins. Seeing these two people kneeling on the ground in a daze and not moving, Bai Yan's expression sank slightly." What? " " Are you still waiting for me to help you up? " The woman's sharp voice fell into Huo Yu's ears. Huo Yu was so shocked that he immediately climbed up from the ground. His trouser legs were covered in blood, and he could not even stand properly. Even so, he still stood on the ground. Even though his legs were trembling, he did not continue to kneel down. Bai Yan looked at the two of them and pointed at the stone seat on the ground."Have a seat. After a short rest, you can go down the mountain."
