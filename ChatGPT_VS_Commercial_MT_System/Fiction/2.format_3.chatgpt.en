Under the suppression of the mortars, chaos was rampant within the base, and no one had noticed the presence of a special force infiltrating the camp. With minimal effort, Kutebov placed the beacon at the designated target, then led his team to evacuate the base and safely reached the evacuation point before calling for an air strike. Soon, Russian stealth bombers flew over from above the clouds, and the four bombs they dropped accurately hit two ammunition depots and two fuel depots within the base. The shock wave from the explosion swept across the entire camp, directly collapsing the concrete buildings in a circle around it. The exploding ammunition and burning fireballs were flying everywhere in the camp, causing a series of chain reactions, with flames and blood and bodies everywhere. The guards stationed in the camp suffered nearly half of their casualties, and most of the remaining people were also wounded, with almost no intact personnel. Medical soldiers carried stretchers and walked through the base, searching for the wounded who had lost their mobility. Engineers wearing heavy bomb-proof suits risked their lives to rush into the fire and drag out the unexploded ammunition from the ruins. Soldiers who could still move all got up and looked for their team to regroup. Salerdos looked at the fire outside the window, and a layer of despair gradually imprinted in his dull pupils. The dense smoke covered the entire base, and the fire light turned the entire night sky red, just like the end of the world. "Xiete..." he muttered to himself, moving his lead-like legs, slowly leaving the window. Turning around, he met the gaze of the commander's staff. "Captain, what should we do?" The aftermath of the explosion finally subsided, and there was no longer any sound of ammunition exploding in the base, but the mood of everyone could not be calm. The mercenaries who escaped from the explosion clearly knew that this was just the beginning of their nightmare. The previous explosion seemed to ignite a signal and sounded the horn of the Sami army's attack. Under Jiang Chen's instructions, Sami seized the fleeting opportunity, stood in front of everyone, and shouted, leading the remaining mobs to the front line. Six thousand people ran on the mossy plain and rushed to the flickering pine forest. Looking from a distance, the scene was spectacular. At the same time, as they looked at the thick smoke rising from the base behind them, all the mercenaries fighting on the front line were thrown into panic and their high morale plummeted in an instant. Despite having the strength to hold the line against the incoming tide of mobs, they no longer had the heart to continue the fight. There was no doubt that the line of defense of Arrow Company had been broken and the stubborn mercenaries were defeated by the sea tactics of the Sami army. Some managed to escape back into the burning base, but most became fugitives and fled into the depths of the forest. There was no need for Jiang Chen to remind them, even the leader should know what to do at this moment. Watching Sami and the mobs start to attack the military base, Jiang Chen put away his binoculars, summoned the previously prepared off-road motorcycle from the storage space, and lightly patted Aisha's back. "It's almost time, let's go." "Uh-huh!" Aisha nodded and, after Jiang Chen sat on the motorcycle, she nimbly hopped on behind him. The engine roared loudly, and the tires chopped up a layer of broken snow. Jiang Chen rode his off-road motorcycle down the slope, took Ayisha around the base side, stopped the motorcycle by the road, and shook out a laser sword from the storage space. He took it in his hand and swished it around a few times, effortlessly cutting through the wire-woven protective wall. The whole base was immersed in fire and chaos, and the sound of mortars could still be heard from time to time. All of the armed mercenaries were at the front line, fighting for control of the main gate of the base with the rebels. Apart from a guard team guarding in front of the command center, no one could be seen in the entire rear. For Jiang Chen and Ayisha, this was no different from having no defense. There were a total of ten guards, two guards standing on the sentry tower, and the remaining eight standing at the entrance of the first and second floors. Ayisha took out the ghost sniper rifle and quietly dealt with the two guards standing on the sentry tower, then used the dead angle of her vision to kill the eight people on the floor one by one. After Ayisha dealt with the guard team outside the command center, Jiang Chen took out his rifle and walked towards the main door. Just when he passed the Hummer car at the door, he happened to collide with Sardes, who had fled from the command center, and the command center's staff officer. When their eyes met, both sides were clearly stunned. The staff officer was the first to react, immediately reaching into his chest to draw his gun, but before he could touch his chest, he was shot in the head by the faster-reacting Ayisha. Sardes was about to resist, but was easily controlled by Jiang Chen, who pressed his hands against the side of the Hummer. "Saldes, male, 43 years old." "As the CEO and Supreme Commander of Arrow Company, am I right?" Although it was the first time they met, Jiang Chen's head was wearing a holographic helmet connected to the ghost agent database, which stored his photo and personal information. Just a face-to-face encounter, and intelligence about him was projected onto the holographic screen. His face was pressed against the hood of the car, but Saldes was tough and still unwilling to surrender, grinding his teeth and saying, "I won't say anything, just kill me..." "Kill you?"  Jiang Chen smiled and didn't take his uncooperative attitude seriously. He made a space with his right hand and took out a needle tube, which he inserted into his right shoulder without hesitation. "Ah!" "A resistive roar came from his throat, Salads rounded his eyes full of blood threads, but soon the brilliance in his pupils faded away. Jiang Chen simply loosened his grip on him, it was impossible for a normal person to resist even after being injected with truth serum, there was no such precedent. Turning Salads over, Jiang Chen asked word by word. 'Where is Carmen?' 'In the research institute of the underground bunker...' 'Where is the underground bunker?' 'The entrance is in the center of the base, can only be entered through an elevator.' 'Next to the entrance are two landing pads, you can see them if you go there.' Question after question, Jiang Chen quickly obtained the information he wanted. 'Good, now you can have your wish.'" Jiang Chen pulled out his gun and fired a shot at his head, then tossed his body aside. It was a rather satisfying way to die, but for the well-known Arrow Company CEO, Mr. Sardes, dying in this anonymous form might be even more painful than death itself...if dead people could feel pain. "Underground bunker, huh." Glancing in the direction of the center of the base, Jiang Chen's lips curled into a cold smile. No matter what Carmen was plotting, his luck was up. The fate of the Rossichard family will be the same as when they started, with a war ringing out, and dying quietly in a war... However, at that moment, a heart-rending scream echoed from afar.
