Under the suppression of the mortar fire, the base was in extreme chaos, and no one noticed that such a special forces unit had infiltrated the camp. Without much effort, Kutepov placed a beacon on the predetermined target, then led his team out of the base. After safely reaching the extraction point, they called for an airstrike. Soon, Russian stealth bombers roared overhead from above the clouds, dropping four cruise missiles that accurately hit two ammunition depots and two fuel depots within the base. The shockwave from the explosions swept across the entire camp, directly collapsing the surrounding concrete buildings. Ammunition detonating and fireballs flew across the camp, triggering a series of chain reactions. There were flames everywhere, along with blood and corpses. The guards stationed in the camp lost nearly half of their personnel, and most of the remaining soldiers were injured, with hardly anyone left unscathed. Medics carrying stretchers moved through the base, searching for incapacitated wounded soldiers. Engineers wearing heavy bomb suits risked their lives, rushing into the blaze to drag unexploded ammunition from the ruins. Soldiers who were still able to move started looking for their units to regroup. Saldes stared at the fire outside the window, and a layer of despair gradually imprinted in his dazed pupils. Thick smoke shrouded the entire base, and the fire dyed the night sky red, like the end of the world. "Damn it…" he muttered to himself. Moving his leaden legs, he slowly left the window. Turning around, he made eye contact with the staff in the command center. "Sir, what should we do?" The aftershocks of the explosions finally subsided, and no more sounds of ammunition detonating could be heard in the base. However, everyone's mood remained far from calm. The mercenaries who had survived the explosion knew that their nightmare was just beginning. The previous explosions seemed to have ignited a signal, sounding the horn for the Sami army's attack. Under Jiang Chen's guidance, the Sami seized this fleeting opportunity, stood in front of everyone, and shouted with raised arms, leading the remaining rebels to the front lines. More than six thousand people ran across the tundra, charging towards the flickering fire-lit pine forest. From a distance, the scene was spectacular. Meanwhile, as they looked at the thick smoke rising from the base behind them, all the mercenaries fighting on the front lines fell into panic. Their morale, which had been high, plummeted in an instant. Facing the onslaught of rebels like a tidal wave, even if they had the strength to hold the line, they had no desire to continue fighting. Without any suspense, the Arrow Company's defenses were breached, and the resisting mercenaries collapsed in the face of the Sami army's human wave tactics. Some retreated back into the burning base, but most became deserters, fleeing deep into the woods. Without Jiang Chen's reminder, even a pig would know what to do at this moment. Watching the Sami lead the rebels in attacking the military base, Jiang Chen put away his binoculars and summoned a previously prepared off-road motorcycle from his storage space. He gently patted Aisha's back. "It's about time, let's get going." "Okay!" Aisha nodded in response, and after Jiang Chen sat on the motorcycle, she agilely straddled behind him. The engine roared, and the tires kicked up a layer of snow. Jiang Chen rode the off-road motorcycle down the slope, taking Aisha around to the side of the base. He parked the motorcycle by the road and took out a laser sword from his storage space. With a few casual swings, he effortlessly cut through the steel wire mesh of the protective wall. The entire base was immersed in fire and chaos, and the sound of mortar explosions could be heard from time to time. All the mercenaries who could carry guns had gone to the front lines, fighting the rebels for control of the base's main entrance. Except for a guard platoon stationed in front of the command center, there were hardly any people left in the rear. For Jiang Chen and Aisha, this was no different from having no defenses at all. There were a total of ten guards, with two stationed in the watchtower and the remaining eight stationed at the entrances on the first and second floors. Aisha took out her Ghost sniper rifle and silently eliminated the two guards in the watchtower. Then, using the blind spots in their field of view, she killed the remaining eight guards one by one. After Aisha dealt with the guards outside the command center, Jiang Chen took out his rifle and walked towards the main entrance. As he passed a Humvee by the door, he happened to bump into Saldes, who was fleeing from the command center in a panic, as well as a staff member. Upon making eye contact, both parties were visibly taken aback. The staff member was the first to react, immediately reaching into his jacket to draw a gun. However, before his hand could even touch his chest, his head was blown off by the faster-reacting Aisha. Saldes tried to resist but was easily subdued by Jiang Chen, who held his hands behind his back and pressed him against the Humvee parked nearby. "Saldes, male, 43 years old." "You are the general manager of Arrow Company and also serve as the supreme commander, am I right?" Although it was their first meeting, Jiang Chen's holographic helmet, connected to the Ghost Agent database, stored Saldes' photo and personal information. Just by seeing his face, the information about him was projected onto the holographic screen. With his face pressed against the hood of the car, Saldes showed some stubbornness, refusing to surrender and gritting his teeth. "I won't say anything, just kill me…" "Kill you?" "I haven't even asked anything yet." Jiang Chen grinned, not caring about Saldes' uncooperative attitude. He freed his right hand and pulled out a syringe, unceremoniously stabbing it into Saldes' shoulder. "Ugh—!" Letting out a resisting roar from his throat, Saldes stared with bloodshot eyes, but the brightness in his pupils soon faded. Jiang Chen simply let go of his grip on Saldes, as there was no precedent for ordinary people to resist after being injected with a truth serum. Turning Saldes over, Jiang Chen asked, word by word, "Where is Carmen?" "In the research institute... inside the underground bunker..." "Where is the underground bunker?" "The entrance is in the center of the base, accessible only by elevator." "Next to the entrance are two helipads; you'll see them as you walk over." With a question and answer, Jiang Chen quickly obtained the information he wanted. "Very well, now you can get your wish." Jiang Chen pulled out his pistol and shot him in the head, then tossed his body to the side. It was quite a swift death, but for the widely renowned general manager of Arrow Company, Mr. Saldes, dying in such an obscure manner might have been more painful than death itself... if dead people could feel pain. "An underground bunker, huh." Looking in the direction of the center of the base, a cold smile appeared on Jiang Chen's lips. No matter what Carmen was plotting, his good fortune should come to an end. The fate of the Rothschild family would be just like how it began: rising to fame due to a war, and dying obscurely due to a war... However, at that moment, a sharp, mournful scream came from the distance.
