With the base in chaos under mortar suppression, no one even noticed that such a special forces unit had infiltrated the camp. With little effort, Kutepov placed beacons on the intended targets, then withdrew from the base with his squad and called in an air strike once he safely reached the evacuation point. Soon, Russian stealth bombers whizzed past above the clouds, dropping four aerial bombs that accurately hit the base's two ammunition and two fuel depots. The blast swept through the entire camp, blowing down the surrounding ring of concrete buildings. The martyred ammunition and burning fire masses flew across the camp, causing a chain reaction of flames, blood and bodies everywhere. Nearly half of the personal guard brigade stationed in the camp was lost, and most of the remaining men were wounded, hardly a single man could be found intact. Medics carried stretchers through the base, searching for the wounded who had lost their ability to move. Engineers, wearing heavy blast suits, risked their lives to rush into the fires, dragging ammunition out of the rubble that had not yet been martyred. Those soldiers who could still move moved, looking for their teams to assemble. Sardes looked out the window at the fire, his dull pupils gradually imprinted with a layer of despair. The smoke obscured the entire base, and the fire turned the entire night sky red, just like the end of the world. "Sheit ......" muttered, he moved his leaden legs and slowly left the window. Turning around, he locked eyes with the command staff officer. "Sir, what should we ...... do?" The aftermath of the explosion finally subsided, no more sounds of martyred ammunition rang out from the base, yet everyone's mood could not be calmed, the mercenaries who escaped from the explosion knew very well that the next step was the beginning of their nightmare. The previous explosion seemed to have ignited some kind of signal, blowing the trumpet of the Sami army's attack. At Jiang Chen's command, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity to stand in front of everyone and raise his arms, leading the rest of the mob. The people rushed to the front line. More than six thousand people ran across the tundra, rushing towards the pine forest where the firelight flickered. From a distance, the scene was spectacular. At the same time, looking at the smoke billowing from the base behind them, all the mercenaries fighting on the front line fell into panic, and the original high morale fell to the bottom in an instant. When faced with the mob coming like a tidal wave, even if they had the strength to hold the defense line, they did not want to fight any longer. Without any suspense, Arrowhead's defense line was broken, and the recalcitrant mercenaries were routed in front of the Sami army's human tactics. Some of them fled back to the base where the fire was burning, but most of them became deserters and fled deep into the woods. No need to remind Jiang Chen, even a pig should know what to do at this time. Watching Sami lead the mob to start attacking the military base, Jiang Chen put away the binoculars in his hand, summoned the pre-prepared motocross bike from the storage space, and gently patted Aisha's back. "It's almost time, let's set off as well." "Mmm!" Aisha nodded in response and waited for Jiang Chen to get on the motorcycle before sitting behind him in a sensitive manner. The engine roared with a whine, and the tires shaved up a layer of broken snow. Jiang Chen rushed down the hill on his cross-country motorcycle, took Aisha around to the side of the base, parked the motorcycle on the side of the road, shook out the laser sword from the storage space, held it in his hand and casually gestured twice, effortlessly cut through the steel wire weave protective wall. The entire base was immersed in fire and chaos, and from time to time mortar bursts could be heard, all the mercenaries who could carry guns were on the front line, fighting with the mob. The mob fought for control of the main gate of the base. In addition to a guard squad in front of the command, the entire rear is no longer visible. For Jiang Chen and Aisha, it was no different from no defense at all. There were ten guards in total, two guards stood on the sentry tower, and the remaining eight stood at the entrances to the first and second floors respectively. Aisha took out her ghost sniper rifle and silently took out the two guards standing on the sentry tower, then used the dead space in her field of vision to kill the eight people upstairs and downstairs one by one. When Aisha finished with the guard squad outside the headquarters, Jiang Chen took out his rifle and walked towards the main gate. Just as he passed the Humvee at the entrance, he bumped into Sardes, who was fleeing from the headquarters, and the command staff. When they met, both sides clearly froze. The staff officer was the first to react and immediately reached into his pocket to pull out his gun, but before his hand could reach his chest, he was shot in the head by Aisha who reacted faster. Sardes was trying to resist, but he was easily controlled by Jiang Chen and pinned to a Humvee with his hands cut back. "Sardes, male, 43 years old." "General Manager of Ren Arrowhead and Supreme Commander, am I right?" Although it was the first time they met, the holographic helmet worn on Jiang Chen's head connected to the Ghost Agent database had his photo and personal information stored in it. With just one look, information about him was projected on the holographic screen. With his face pressed against the hood of the car, this Salters to also be considered hard-headed, froze unwilling to surrender, gritted his teeth and said. "I will not say anything, you kill me ......" "Kill you?" "I haven't asked anything yet." Jiang Chen grinned, not caring at all about his uncooperative attitude, pulled out a syringe with his free right hand and stabbed him in the back of his shoulder without ceremony. "Wha--!" A hiss of resistance came from his throat, and Sardes stared round at his bloodshot eyes, but soon the look in his pupils dulled. Jiang Chen simply let go of his hand, ordinary people can still resist after injecting the real agent, there is no such precedent. Turning Sardes on his side, Jiang Chen asked word for word. "Where is Carmen?" "The underground bunker ...... inside the institute." "Where is the underground bunker?" "The entrance is in the middle of the base and can only be accessed through an elevator." "There are two landing pads next to the entrance, you can see them when you walk over." One question and one answer, and soon Jiang Chen got the information he wanted. "Very well, now you can have what you want." Jiang Chen pulled out his pistol and added a shot to his head, then tossed his body aside. It was a rather painful way to die, but for the prestigious General Manager of Arrowhead, Mr. Sardes, dying in this silent form might have caused him more pain than death itself ...... if the dead could suffer. "Underground bunker?" Looking in the direction of the center of the base, the corner of Jiang Chen's mouth hooked up a cold smile. No matter what else Carmen was plotting, it was time for his good fortune to come to an end. The fate of the Rothschild family would be just as they had begun, rising to fame because of a war and dying in obscurity because of a war ...... However, just then, a harsh shrill whistle came from the distance.
