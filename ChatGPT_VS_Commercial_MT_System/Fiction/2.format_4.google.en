Under the suppression of the mortar, the chaos in the base was abnormally chaotic, and no one noticed that such a special forces were mixed into the camp.	 There was almost no much effort, and Cuttpov placed the beacon on the scheduled target, and then took the team to withdraw from the base. After arriving at the withdrawal point safely, he called the air strike.	 Soon, the Russian stealth bomber whistled from the clouds, and the four air bombs cast accurately hit the two ammunition libraries and two fuel warehouses in the base.	 The shock wave of the explosion swept through the entire camp, directly blowing the concrete buildings around the surrounding circle.	 The explosive ammunition and the burning fire group flew across the camp, causing a series of chain reactions. There were flames everywhere, and blood and bodies were everywhere.	 The defender who stationed in the camp was almost half damaged, and most of the remaining people were injured, and they could hardly find a complete person.	 Medical soldiers walked through the stretcher in the base, searching for the wounded who lost their motivation.	 Workers wore a heavy explosion -proof service, rushed into the fire field, and dragged out the ammunition that had not been exploded from the ruins.	 The soldiers who could move all moved, looking for their own team assembly.	 Saldes looked at the fire outside the window, and the dull pupil gradually printed a layer of despair. The thick smoke covered the entire base, and the light of the fire dyed the entire night sky red, just like the end of the world.	 "Shete ..." She murmured to himself, and he moved his legs with his legs and slowly left the window.	 Turning around, he looked at the staff of the headquarters.	 "Chief, what should we do?" Yu Bo, the explosion, finally calmed down, and there was no longer the sound of ammunition explosion in the base. However, everyone's mood could not be calm.	 It is clear that the next time they are the beginning of their nightmare.	 The previous explosion seemed to ignite a certain signal and sounded the corner of the Sami army's offense.	 Under Jiang Chen's instruction, Sami seized the fleeting opportunity, stood in front of everyone, and shouted, with the remaining violence. The people rushed to the front line.	 More than 6,000 people ran on the moss and rushed towards the flashed pine forest.	 Looking from a distance, the scene is spectacular. At the same time, looking at the thick smoke floating behind the base, all the mercenaries fighting at the front line were in panic, and the original morale fell to the bottom of the valley in an instant.	 When facing the mobs like a tide, even if they had that strength to stabilize the line of defense, they would not fight again.	 Without any suspense, the defense of the arrow company was broken, and the stubborn mercenaries could not be defeated in front of the Sami Army's sea tactics.	 Some people fled back to the base that burned the fire, but most people were deserted and fled deep into the woods.	 There is no need to remind Jiang Chen, even the pigs should know what should be done at this time.	 Watching Sami began to attack the military base with the mobs, Jiang Chen put away the telescope in his hand, summoned the off -road motorcycle prepared in advance from the storage space, and gently patted Asha's back.	 "It's almost, let's go." "Hmm!" Aisa nodded, waiting for Jiang Chen to sit on the motorcycle, and sat across him sensitively.	 The engine groaned, and the tire was placed a layer of broken snow. Jiang Chen rushed off the hillside with an off -road motorcycle, took A Esha to the side of the base, stopped the motorcycle on the side of the road, shaking the laser sword from the storage space, and scratched it twice in his hand.	 The steel wire woven protective wall was cut without the effort.	 The entire base is immersed in fire and chaos. From time to time, you can hear the burst of mortars. All the mercenaries that can carry guns have topped the front line, and the control of the main entrance of the base with violence.	 Except for a guard Ban before the headquarters, no one can be seen throughout the big behind.	 For Jiang Chen and Assa, this is no different from that there is no defense.	 A total of ten guards, two guards stood on the whistle tower, and the remaining eight stood at the entrance of the first and second floors.	 Asa took out the ghost sniper rifle and silently solved the two guards standing on the whistle tower, and then used the dead ends of the field of vision to kill the eight people upstairs and downstairs one by one.	 When Aisha resolved the guard class outside the headquarters, Jiang Chen took out the rifle and walked towards the main entrance. When he passed the Hummer at the door, he just hit the royal escape from the headquarters.	 Saldes and the staff of the headquarters.	 Both sides obviously stunned.	 The staff member first reacted, and immediately put his hand into his arms to pull his gun. However, before his hands touched his chest, he was reacting faster.	 Saldes was trying to resist, but was easily controlled by Jiang Chen, and he pressed his hands on the Hummer's Hummer. "Saldes, male, 43 years old." "The general manager of Renjian Company, concurrently served as the highest commander, is it right?" Although it was the first time, but wearing a ghost agent database on Jiang Chentou	 In the holographic helmet, his photos and personal information are stored.	 Just a face -to -face, the information about him was projected on the holographic screen.	 The face was pressed on the car cover, and Saldes was also tough, and he was unwilling to surrender, gritted his teeth.	 "I wouldn't say anything, you killed me ..." "I killed you?" "I didn't ask anything." Jiang Chen grinned and laughed, and he didn't care about his unsuccessful attitude, Teng	 Pull out a needle tube out of his right hand, and he was politely stuck on his back shoulder.	 "Well--!" A resistant roar made of his throat, and Saldis stared at his blood -covered eyes, but soon the gorgeousness in his pupils faded down.	 Jiang Chen simply released his hand and captured his hand. Ordinary people could resist the vomiting agent and could resist this precedent at all.	 Turning Saldes, Jiang Chen asked one by one.	 "Where is Carmen?" "Underground bunkers ... in the research institute." "Where is the underground bunker?" "The entrance is in the center of the base, and you can only enter through the lifting ladder."	 You can see it in the past. "As soon as he answered, Jiang Chen soon got the information he wanted.	 "Very good, now you can do your best." Jiang Chen took out his pistol and made a shot at his head, and then threw his body aside.	 This is a very happy way of death, but for Mr. Saldis, the general manager of the prestigious arrow company, he died in this obscure form, which may be more painful than the death itself ... if the dead would be painful.	 "Underground bunkers." Looking at the direction of the center of the base, Jiang Chen's mouth sneered.	 No matter what Kamen is still looking at, his good luck should be in the end.	 The fate of the Roschild family will be as the fame of war, because a war died in obscurity ... but at this moment, there was a scream of screams in the distance.
