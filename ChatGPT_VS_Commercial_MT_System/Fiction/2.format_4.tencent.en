Under the suppression of mortars, the base was in chaos. No one noticed that such a special force had infiltrated the camp. It took almost no effort for Kutpov to place a beacon on the predetermined target. Then he led the team to withdraw from the base. After arriving safely at the evacuation point, he called for an air strike. Soon, Russia stealth bombers roared through the clouds.The four bombs that were dropped accurately hit two ammunition depots and two fuel depots in the base. The shock wave of the explosion swept through the entire camp, directly blowing down the surrounding concrete buildings. The ammunition and burning balls of fire flew across the camp, causing a series of chain reactions. Flames, blood, and corpses were everywhere. Half of the personal guards stationed in the camp were instantly killed, and most of the remaining people were injured.Almost no one could be found intact. Medic soldiers carried stretchers through the base, searching for the disabled. Engineer soldiers, wearing heavy explosion-proof suits, risked their lives to rush into the fire and pull out unexploded ammunition from the ruins. The soldiers who could still move all moved, looking for their own team to assemble. Sardes looked at the fire outside the window, and a layer of despair gradually appeared in his dull eyes. " Sh * t…" He muttered to himself as he moved his legs that seemed to be filled with lead and slowly left the window. He turned around and met the eyes of the staff officer in the command center. " Sir, what should we do? " The aftermath of the explosion finally subsided. There was no longer the sound of ammunition exploding in the base, but everyone could not calm down.The mercenaries who escaped the explosion knew that their nightmare was about to begin. The previous explosion seemed to ignite some kind of signal and sounded the horn of the Sami army's attack. Under Jiang Chen's instructions, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity and stood in front of everyone, raising his arms and shouting. He led the remaining rioters to the front line. More than 6,000 people ran on the tundra and rushed towards the burning pine forest. From afar, the scene was spectacular. At the same time, looking at the thick smoke rising from the base behind them, all the mercenaries fighting on the front line fell into panic. Their high morale instantly fell to the bottom. When faced with the mob that was charging at them like a tide, even if they had the strength to stabilize the defense line, they had no intention of fighting anymore. Without any suspense, Arrow's defense line was broken through. The stubborn mercenaries were defeated by the Sami army's human wave tactics. Some of them fled back to the burning base.However, most of the people deserted and fled into the depths of the forest. Even a pig would know what to do without Jiang Chen's reminder. Seeing Sammy leading the mob to attack the military base, Jiang Chen put away the binoculars in his hand and summoned the off-road motorcycle he had prepared in advance from his storage dimension. He gently patted Ayesha's back.She nimbly straddled behind him and the engine roared, the tires scraping up a layer of snow. Jiang Chen rode the off-road motorcycle down the hill and took Ayesha to the side of the base. He parked the motorcycle on the side of the road and took out the laser sword from the storage dimension. He waved it in his hand and effortlessly cut through the steel wire protective wall. The entire base was immersed in fire and chaos. From time to time, the sound of mortars could be heard. All the mercenaries who could carry guns went to the front line.Fighting with the rioters for control of the main entrance of the base. Other than a guard squad in front of the command center, there was no one in the entire rear. For Jiang Chen and Ayesha, this was no different from being defenseless. There were a total of ten guards. Two guards stood on the sentry tower, and the remaining eight stood at the entrances of the first and second floors. Ayesha took out the ghost sniper rifle and quietly took care of the two guards standing on the sentry tower. Then, she used the blind spot of her vision.He killed the eight people upstairs and downstairs one by one. After Ayesha took care of the guard squad outside the headquarters, Jiang Chen took out his rifle and walked towards the front door. Just as he passed the Hummer, he bumped into Sardes, who was fleeing from the headquarters, and the staff officer of the headquarters. When their eyes met, both parties were stunned. The staff officer was the first to react and immediately reached into his pocket to take out his gun. However, before his hand reached his chest, he said,Sardes was about to resist, but he was easily controlled by Jiang Chen and his hands were pressed against the Hummer. " Sardes, male, 43 years old. " " As the general manager of Arrow, he is also the highest commander. Am I right? " Although it was the first time they met, the holographic helmet on Jiang Chen's head connected to the Ghost Agent database stored his photo and personal information. In just one face, the information about him was projected on the holographic screen. With his face pressed against the hood, Sardes was tough and unwilling to surrender." Kill you? " " I haven't asked anything yet. " Jiang Chen grinned and didn't care about his uncooperative attitude. He took out a syringe and stabbed it into his shoulder. Sardes let out a roar of resistance. His bloodshot eyes widened, but the light in his pupils quickly dimmed. Jiang Chen simply let go of his hand. Ordinary people could resist after being injected with truth serum, there was no such precedent. Turning Sardes over, Jiang Chen asked word by word. " Where is Carmen? " " Underground bunker ... in the research institute. " " Where is the underground bunker? " " The entrance is in the center of the base." There are two helipads next to the entrance. You can see them when you walk over. " With a question and answer, Jiang Chen quickly got the information he wanted. " Very good, now you can get what you want. " Jiang Chen took out his pistol and shot him in the head before throwing his body aside. It was a rather pleasant death, but for the famous Arrow CEO, Mr. Saldes, dying in such a silent manner was perhaps more painful than death itself ... if the dead could suffer.The fate of the Rothschilds would be the same as they had started, rising to fame because of a war, and dying in silence because of a war…However, at this moment, a shrill scream came from afar.
