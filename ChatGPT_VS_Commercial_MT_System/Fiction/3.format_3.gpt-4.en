"What are you doing?!" Donggong Lao Yezi knocked on his cane, his voice filled with anger. "Our ancestor will be here soon, please be patient, Donggong Lao Yezi. You will know what we're going to do soon," the leading man replied. Donggong Lao Yezi naturally knew who the 'ancestor' in his mouth referred to. He felt a little at a loss, not knowing why Pei Yi was coming. Having a grudge with DK was not a good thing, even though everyone in R Country wanted to drive DK out, but it simply couldn't be done. It was just wishful thinking. After a few minutes, Pei Yi's car arrived. He got out of the car and turned his gaze to a car not far away. An Xiaoning saw him, and without removing her mask and wig, she also got out of the car. Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind. "You're here," An Xiaoning spoke. Pei Yi looked her up and down, and rarely laughed. He walked up to her, leaned in a bit, and whispered, "Hey, with this disguise, this group of people would have a hard time guessing it's you, right?" "Of course, I don't want them to know my identity, that's why I asked you to come. Now is not the time." Pei Yi subconsciously glanced at Wu Lianzhi, "Why are you with him?" "I have my reasons." He straightened up, turned around, and with a faint smile on his face, said to the people of the Donggong family, "I don't know where my sister has offended the people of your Donggong family, that you actually want to kill her?" "Has your courage grown to your head?" Upon hearing this, the faces of the Donggong family members changed instantly. Pei Yi's sister? Where did Pei Yi get a sister from? Donggong Laotai spoke up, "Mr. Pei's sister... we really didn't know anything about her." "It's fine if you didn't know, but now I'm telling you," Pei Yi said coldly. "Did you hear it clearly?" "Since Mr. Pei says this is your cousin, please take your cousin away. As for Donggong Lianzhi, his name is still on my family's genealogy, and we have not yet disowned this rebellious grandson. He is still a member of our Donggong family, and how we deal with him is our family's internal affair." Before Pei Yi could answer, An Xiaoning seized the opportunity to call out to him, "Brother, he's my boyfriend, and I'm carrying his child now. You can't abandon him." Pei Yi had originally planned to take her away, but now it seemed a bit tricky. However, being domineering and aggressive was his style. As long as he wanted to do something, this matter was not a problem at all. "Old lady, you heard it too. This man... is technically my brother-in-law now, and they have a child together. If we hand him over to you, wouldn't that leave the child without a father in the future?" "Do you think I would agree to that?" Donggong Laotai was very clear that if she let Pei Yi take him away, they would no longer be able to deal with their grandson openly in the future. Therefore, even though she was somewhat wary of DK's influence, she could not afford to show a weak attitude. "Mr. Pei, I'm afraid this is not possible. Our family has its own rules, and outsiders are not allowed to interfere in the handling of our family members." "I've already said, he is the father of the child in my sister's womb. Are your ears failing you due to old age?" Pei Yi shifted his gaze to Wu Lianzhi, "You tell me, are you a member of the Donggong family?" "This morning, when my mother sent me poisoned food, I severed our mother-daughter relationship on the spot. Before that, when the Donggong family tried to set up an accidental death for Miss An and her subordinates, I had already made it very clear. Even though the name Donggong Lianzhi is still on the family tree and the Donggong family's household register, I no longer bear the surname Donggong. My name is now Wu Lianzhi, and I am no longer a member of the Donggong family!" His words were firm and resolute, each sentence filled with coldness. Speaking these words in front of so many people proved his determination. "It's not up to you to decide!" Donggong Laotai said, "Once you're in the Donggong family, you live as one of us, and you die as our ghost!" "Then, Madam Donggong, I want to ask you, since Miss An is already aware of your plot to murder her, aren't you worried that Country S will lodge a formal protest while you're here trying to punish me?" These words came from Wu Lianzhi's mouth, spoken with unfamiliarity but without fear. "I have dealt with An Xiaoning before," Pei Yi said with a slight smile. "She is the type to take revenge for any grievances. If you try to take her life, do you think she will let it go?" "Alright, enough talk. My time is precious, so I'm taking both of them with me." Seeing that the Donggong family members were about to speak again, he added, "Unless you want bloodshed here." And just like that, the Donggong family watched as their cooked duck flew away completely. Donggong Laotai and Laoyezi were infuriated. In the end, Donggong Laotai spoke directly, "Forget it, just remove his name and destroy his household registration!" "We need to return to Country S," Pei Yi glanced at her. "So you're leaving after using me?" "Didn't you say you would grant me a request? I haven't even mentioned it yet, and you're already talking about going back?" "I'm in a hurry to return to my country for business, but I really will grant you a request. Tell me, what is it?" "Well, my request might be a bit difficult for you..." "Forget it, don't mention it. Make a request that doesn't seem too difficult for me." Pei Yi turned to face her, his gaze fixed on her. "You really haven't changed at all. Accompany me for half a month." "In what way?" "Just like before." An Xiaoning looked at him, "No, first, no chains, you can't restrict my freedom. Second, half a month is too long, two days will do." "..." Pei Yi's smile slightly faded, "Your bargaining is a bit too extreme. Five days, no less. You said you would let others make a request, and when they do, you can't go back on your word. I promise I'll give you your freedom." "Can I go back to my country first?" "No." Wu Lianzhi, who was in the car, listened to their conversation and wondered if these two had something going on. Could it be that they had an ambiguous relationship? The more he listened, the more it seemed like it. But if that were the case, the two of them were being quite indiscreet in front of him. "How about letting him go back to Country S first, and I'll stay with you alone? Is that okay?" "I won't do anything to you two, let's just do this together." His words left no room for doubt. An Xiaoning didn't say anything more. Since they were not far from Qingping Mountain, they arrived quickly. Coming back to this place evoked a mix of emotions. The moment Qin Guo saw her, she was genuinely unhappy. As they entered, she immediately rolled her eyes, wondering why her ancestor had brought this plague back again.
