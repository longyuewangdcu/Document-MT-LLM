"What are you doing?!" Elder Donggong knocked the cane in his hand, and his voice was tinged with anger. "Our ancestor will be here soon, please take a moment to calm down, Master Donggong, what to do, you will know later." The man in the lead said back. Master Donggong naturally knew who the 'ancestor' he was referring to. He was a little overwhelmed, not knowing why Pei Yi wanted to come. Having a problem with DK was not a good thing, and although everyone in R wanted to drive DK out, they simply couldn't do it. Just empty thoughts. After a few minutes, Pei Yi's car arrived. He got down from the car, his eyes shifted to the car not far away. An Xiao Lime saw him, did not take off his mask and wig, and got down from the car as well. Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind. "You're here." An Xiaolime uttered. Pei Yi looked her up and down, a rare laugh came out, walked to her, came a few minutes closer to her, lowered his voice and said, "Aiyo, this group of people look at you in this shape, it is also difficult to guess that it is you, right?" "Of course, just don't want them to know my identity, that's why I let you come, now is not the time." Pei Yi subconsciously glanced at Wu Lianzhi, "Why are you with him in a piece?" "Something." He straightened up and turned around, with a light smile on his face to the Donggong family, "I don't know where my sister has pissed off your Donggong family people, how dare you try to kill her?" "Have your guts grown to the top of your heads?" When the people of the Donggong family heard that, their faces instantly changed. Where did Pei Yi's sister come from? Donggong old lady spoke out, "Mr. Pei's sister ...... we really don't know anything about it." "Don't know well, now I tell you." Pei Yi said in a cold voice, "Heard clearly?" "Since Mr. Pei said this is your cousin, then please just take your cousin away, as for Donggong Lianzhi, his name is still on my family genealogy, not yet removed from such a rebellious grandson, still my Donggong family, how we want to dispose of him is our Donggong family's family matter." Pei Yi has not yet answered, An Xiao Lime saw the opportunity to shout out to him, "Brother, he is my boyfriend, I now have his flesh and blood in my belly, you can not leave him ah." Pei Yi originally wanted to just take her away, but I did not expect it to be a little tricky now. However, brutal and domineering is also his style, as long as he wants to do what, this matter is not a matter at all. "Old woman, you also heard, this ...... is also considered my brother-in-law, they both have children, handing people over to you, is not the child without a father in the future?" "Do you think I will agree?" Donggong old lady is very clear, let Pei Yi take away, then in the future they will not be able to dispose of this grandson of theirs in a just manner, so, although some scruples DK's power, the attitude can not be weakened. "Mr. Pei, I'm afraid I can't do this, our family has its own family law, for the disposal of our own family members, outsiders are not allowed to interfere." "All said, he is the father of the child in my sister's belly it, are you old and have bad ears?" Pei Yi turned his gaze to Wu Lianzhi, "You come and say, are you from the Donggong family?" "This morning, when my mother brought me the toxic meal, I had already broken the mother-daughter relationship with her on the spot, before that, when the people of the Donggong family attempted to design me and Miss An and his subordinates into an accidental death, I had already made it very clear, now although the name Donggong Lianzhi is still on the genealogy and the Donggong family's account book, but, my last name is now no longer I am now Wu, Wu Lianzhi is my name now, I am no longer a member of the Donggong family!" Every word was strong and powerful, and every sentence was full of cold intent. To say these words openly in front of so many people proves his determination. "It's not up to you!" The old lady of the Eastern Palace said, "If you enter my Eastern Palace, you will be born as a member of our family and die as a ghost of our family!" "Then old lady Donggong, I want to ask you, your design to murder Miss An is already known to her, you are in the mood to punish and dispose of me here at this moment, are you not worried about the S country side to make strict representations?" These words came from Wu Lianzhi's mouth, his tone was rusty and fearless. "I have dealt with An Xiao Lime." Pei Yi smiled faintly, "She is a person who is the type of person who will retaliate when she has an enemy, you guys want her life, will she be able to give up in good grace?" "Well, without further ado, my time is precious, I'll take both of them." Seeing that the people of the Donggong family were about to speak again, he added, "If you don't want to see blood here." In this way, the Donggong family watched the already cooked duck completely fly away. The old woman and the old man were so angry that they couldn't do it. In the end, the old lady Donggong directly said, "Forget it, remove his name and destroy the account!" "We have to go back to S." Pei Yi slanted her a glance, "After using and then withdraw?" "Didn't you say you would promise me a request, I haven't even said this, and then you say go back to your country?" "I am in a hurry to return to the country something, but promise you a request is also true, say, what request?" "Well, my request may be a little difficult for you ......" "Then don't mention it, say one that makes me feel like it won't be difficult." Pei Yi turned sideways and stared at her with unblinking eyes, "You really haven't changed a bit, accompany me for half a month." "How a companion?" "The same as before." An Xiaolime looked at him, "No, first, can not be chained, can not limit my freedom, second half a month is too long, two days can be." "......" Pei Yi smile slightly converged, "you this cut price cut is also too much, five days, can not be less, said to let others make requests, others mentioned, you can not be faithless to your word, will certainly give you freedom. " "Then can you let me go back to my country first?" "Can't." Wu Lianzhi in the car listening to the two people's conversation, really think, these two people are not a leg? Could it be that these two people are having an unclear relationship? How it sounded felt like. But if it is, those two people are too unapologetic in front of him. "Then let him go back to S first, and I'll be alone at your place, okay?" "I won't do anything to you guys, let's stay together." His words were unquestionable. An Xiaolime no longer said anything. Because it was not much far from Qingping Mountain, so it arrived very quickly. The place is still really mixed feelings when you come back to it. The moment Qin Guo saw her, her heart was really unhappy, and when they went in, she immediately rolled her eyes. Thinking about how her ancestors brought this plague back again.
