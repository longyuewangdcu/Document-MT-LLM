"What are you doing?!" Father Donggong knocked on the crutch on his hand, his voice was angry.	 "Our ancestors will arrive immediately, please ask the East Palace to be a little irritable. What do you want to do?" When you know, you will know. "The man who took the lead replied.	 Father Donggong naturally knows who the ancestor in his mouth refers to.	 He was a little overwhelmed, and he didn't know why Pei Yi came.	 It's not a good thing to have a holiday with DK. Although everyone in R country wants to drive DK out, it can't be done at all.	 Just think.	 After a few minutes, Pei Yi's car arrived.	 He came down from the car and turned his eyes to the car not far away.	 An Xiaolian saw him and did not pick the mask and wig, and came down from the car. Wu Lianzhi followed.	 "You're here." An Xiaoying made a sound.	 Pei Yi looked up and down at a glance, rarely laughed, walked in front of her, closer her, and lowered her voice, "Oh, this group of people look at your shape, it is difficult to guess you?" "Of course	 I just don't want them to know my identity, so it is not the time to let you come. "Pei Yi glanced at Wu Lianzhi subconsciously," Why do you follow him? "" There is something. "	 Body, turned around, and said with a smile on his face, "I don't know where my sister has provoked the people of your East Palace family, but they want to kill her?" "Your courage has grown up to	 On the top of his head? "When the people of the Donggong family heard it, the face changed instantly, Pei Yi's sister?	 Where does Pei Yilou come from? The old lady in the East Palace came out, "Mr. Pei's sister ... we really don't know at all." "I don't know, now I tell you." Pei Yi said coldly, "Can you listen clearly?"	 "Since Mr. Pei said that this is your cousin, please take your cousin away. As for the East Palace Lotus, his name is still on my family genealogy.	 Family people, how do we deal with him is the family affairs of our East Palace family. "Pei Yi hadn't answered yet. An Xiaolian shouted him when he saw the opportunity," Brother, he is my boyfriend, and now I have him in his stomach.	 You can't throw him down. "Pei Yi originally wanted to take her away. I didn't expect it to be a bit tricky now.	 However, it is also his style that he is overbearing. As long as he wants to do, it is not a matter of this matter.	 "Old lady, you heard it too, this ... is also my brother -in -law. Both of them have the children, and give people to you, wouldn't the child have no dad in the future?" "Do you think I will agree?"	 The old lady in the East Palace was very clear that they would let Pei Yi go away. After that, they could not handle their grandson in a bright and bright manner. Therefore, although some of the power of dk DK, the attitude could not be weakened. "Mr. Pei, I am afraid that this is not possible. Our family has its own family law. For the disposal of their own people, outsiders do not allow interference." "Both said, he is the father of my sister's belly.	 Isn't it good? "Pei Yi turned his eyes to Wu Lianzhi." For you, are you from the East Palace family? "" This morning, when my mother gave me a poisonous meal, I was already on the spot on the spot	 I decided her relationship with her. Previously, when the people of the Donggong family attempted to designed me and his subordinates as an accidental death, I was already very clear. Although the name of Donggong Lianzhi is still in the genealogy	 On the household registration book of the Donggong family, but I am no longer the Donggong of the East Palace, my surname is Wu, Wu Lianzhi is my current name, I am no longer the people of the East Palace family! "	 Cold.	 In the presence of so many people, he said these words to prove his determination.	 "This is not what you said!" The old lady of the East Palace said, "Entering my East Palace, life is our family, and death is our ghost of our family!"	 The matter of murdering Miss An has been known to her. At this moment, you are in a mood to punish me here, and don't you worry that the statement of strictly negotiating on the side of S. This is from Wu Lianzhi's mouth.	 Fear of fear.	 "An Xiaolian and I have made a deal." Pei Yi smiled slightly. "She is a type of revenge. Do you want her life, can she give up?" "Well, I don't say much nonsense. My time is more valuable. I have taken them away." Seeing that the people in the Donggong family were about to speak again, he added another sentence, "If you don't want to see blood here."	 In this way, the people of the Donggong family saw the ducks that had been cooked completely away.	 The old lady and old lady in the East Palace can't work.	 In the end, the old lady in the East Palace spoke directly. "Forget it, remove his name, and destroy the hukou!" "We have to return to S country."	 Will you promise me a request? I haven't said this yet, I just say back? "" I was in a hurry to return to China, but I promised you that one request is true, let's say, what requirements? "" Well, my	 You may be a bit embarrassed ... " "Don't mention it, say one that makes me feel uncomfortable." Pei Yi looked sideways, staring at her intently, "You really haven't changed at all, accompany me for half a month." "How do you	 This is the same? "" The same as before. "An Xiaolian looked at him," No, first, you can't get on the chain, you can't limit my freedom, the second half of the second half is too long, two days can be. "	 … "Pei Yi smiled slightly," You bargain and chopped too much. In five days, you can't be less. It is said that let others ask for requests. If others mention it, you can’t speak without faith.	 Yes. "" Can you let me return home first? "" No. "Wu Lianzhi in the car listened to the conversation between the two. It really felt, do these two have a leg?	 Is there an unclear relationship between the two? It feels like it sounds.	 But if so, the two people were too unavoidable in front of him.	 "Then let him go back to the country first, I am alone, can I do it?" "I won't I do to you, let's." His words were unquestionable.	 An Xiaolian stopped saying anything.	 Because it is not far from Qingping Mountain, it will arrive soon.	 When you come again, you really have a sense of intersection.	 The moment Qin Guo saw her, she was really unhappy. When they entered, she immediately turned her eyes.	 I wondered how her ancestors brought this plague again.
