" What are you guys doing?! " Old Master Donggong knocked on his walking stick, his voice filled with anger. " Our ancestor will be here soon. Please calm down, Old Master Donggong. You'll know what he's up to later, " the man in the lead replied. Old Master Donggong naturally knew who the 'ancestor' he was referring to. He was at a loss as to why Pei Yi was here. It was not a good thing to have a grudge with DK, even though everyone in Japan wanted to kick DK out.A few minutes later, Pei Yi's car arrived. He alighted from the car and shifted his gaze to the car not far away. An Xiaoning saw him and got out of the car without removing his mask and wig. " You're here, " An Xiaoning said. Pei Yi sized her up and laughed out loud, which was a rare occurrence. He walked up to her and leaned closer to her. He lowered his voice and said, " Aiyo, it's hard for these people to guess that it's you from your appearance, right? Of course, I didn't want them to know my identity, so I asked you to come. It's not the right time yet. " Pei Yi glanced at Wu Lianzhi subconsciously." Why are you with him? " " Something's up. " He straightened his body and turned around. He smiled at the Donggong clan members and said, " I wonder how my sister offended your Donggong clan members to the point that you want to kill her? " " Have you grown so bold that you can go to the top of your heads? " The Donggong clan members 'expressions changed instantly when they heard that. Pei Yi's sister? Where did Pei Yi get a sister? Old Madam Donggong said, " Mr. Pei's sister…We really don't know anything about her. " " It's easy if you don't know. I'll tell you now, " Pei Yi said coldly. " Did you hear me clearly? Since Mr. Pei said that she's your cousin, please take her away. As for Donggong Lianzhi, his name is still in my family's genealogy. He hasn't been removed from the name of such a rebellious grandson. He's still a member of the Donggong family." How we're going to deal with him is a family matter of the Donggong family. " Before Pei Yi could reply, An Xiaoning acted according to the situation and called out to him, " Brother, he's my boyfriend. I'm pregnant with his child now. You can't just abandon him. " Pei Yi had originally wanted to take her away, but he did not expect that things would be a little troublesome now. However, it was his style to be rude and overbearing. As long as he wanted to do something, it would not be a problem at all." Do you think I'll agree? " Old Madam Donggong knew very well that if she let Pei Yi take her away, they would not be able to deal with her grandson openly in the future. Therefore, even though they were afraid of DK's influence, they could not weaken their attitude. " Mr. Pei, I'm afraid that's not possible. Our family has its own rules. Outsiders are not allowed to interfere in the handling of family members. " " Everyone says that he is the father of my sister's child. Are you old and deaf? " Pei Yi turned to Wu Lianzhi. " Tell me, are you a member of the Donggong family? " " This morning, when my mother brought me the poisoned food, I decided on the spot that we were mother and daughter. Previously,"When the Donggong Family tried to frame Miss An, me, and his subordinates as accidental deaths, I was already very clear. Although the name Donggong Lianzhi is still on the family tree and the Donggong Family's household register, my surname is no longer Donggong. My surname is Wu now. Wu Lianzhi is my current name. I am no longer a member of the Donggong Family!"" That's not up to you! " Old Madam Donggong said. " If you're in the Donggong Palace, you're part of our family in life, but you're part of our family in death! Then, Old Madam Donggong, I want to ask you something. She already knows about your plot to murder Miss An. If you're in the mood to punish me right now, aren't you worried that S Nation will make a serious complaint? " These words came from Wu Lianzhi's unfamiliar voice." I've dealt with An Xiaoning before, " Pei Yi said with a faint smile. " She's the type of person who will take revenge for her crimes. Would she let it go if you want her life? " " Alright, let's cut to the chase. My time is more precious, so I'll take these two away. " Seeing that the Donggong clan was about to speak again, he added, " If you don't want to see blood here. " Just like that, the Donggong clan members watched as the cooked duck flew away completely. The Donggong old lady and the old master were so angry that they couldn't take it anymore. Finally, the Donggong old lady said, " Forget it, forget it. Remove his name." We have to go back to S Nation. " Pei Yi gave her a sideways glance. " We're leaving after we're done using them? " " Didn't you say that you'd agree to one of my requests? I haven't even mentioned that yet, and you're already saying that you're going back to China? " " I'm in a hurry to return to China, but I'm also serious about agreeing to one of your requests. Tell me, what request? " " Hmm, my request might be a little difficult for you…" " Then don't mention it. Name me something that won't make things difficult for me. You really haven't changed at all. You'll accompany me for half a month. " An Xiaoning stared at him and said, " How do I accompany you? " " Same as before. " No. Firstly, I can't be chained up or restricted. Secondly, half a month is too long. Two days is fine. "" Then can you let me return to the country first? " " No. " Wu Lianzhi, who was in the car, listened to their conversation and really felt that these two people were having an affair. Could it be that these two people had an unclear relationship? " Then, let him return to Sydnay first. I'll stay with you alone, alright? " " I won't do anything to you guys. Let's go together. " His words were unquestionable. An Xiaoning did not say anything else. Since it was not far from Mount Qingping, they would arrive very quickly. If they came to this place again, she would have mixed feelings. The moment Qin Guo saw her, she was really unhappy. When they entered, she said, "She immediately rolled her eyes, wondering why her ancestor had brought this God of Plague back.
