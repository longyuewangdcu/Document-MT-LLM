Yan Ru Sheng shot her a disdainful look and said, "Wen Wen Wen, you're so full of yourself." "Don't I look good?" Wen Wen Wen frowned and pouted, feigning anger. Yan Ru Sheng chuckled and then laughed, grasping Wen Wen Wen's upper body with one hand and pinching her chest hard. He lowered his head, gritted his teeth and growled, "Deceptive silly woman." He quickened his pace, walked to the bedside, and threw Wen Wen Wen onto the bed without any hesitation. He then undressed himself, removing all constraints, and got into the bed, pressing down on Wen Wen Wen. It was simple and rough, not beautiful at all. His deep black eyes locked with hers and Wen Wen Wen's heartbeat accelerated uncontrollably. Yes, even after so many years of being together, every time she made eye contact with him, her heart still fluttered and she felt embarrassed. Perhaps it's because they are too familiar, they always feel awkward. That's why people say that it's hard to start with someone you're familiar with, and rabbits don't eat the grass near their burrow. This is truly the case. Watching Xugus face turn red from shyness, her words come to life as she becomes excited and then annoyed. The excitement is a natural hormone reaction within her, and the annoyance is from her inner feelings. Although he likes the way she looks when she's shy, he doesn't like the way she squirms from shyness, always being so reserved and not taking the initiative. "What else do you want to hear? I've told you everything, just look at me." Xugus hands hold Xugus face, forcing her to look at him. Xugus face turned even redder, she pouted her mouth, her eyes wandering uncertainly. "Then you quickly say, did you steal someone else's love letter for me?" "Uh..." Xugus thinks while speaking, "Aside from Zhao Zheng's love letter, Jiang Zhuohuang's chocolate, and movie tickets, there's also the colorful Seven-Colored Stick Stick Hall of the son of the director of the public security bureau, Hao Bang, who's one grade higher than us." Upon hearing this, Xugus was very surprised, "What? Hao Bang?" That science top student who is said to be "praised by ten thousand people"? The reason he is called "praised by ten thousand people" is because of his name, not because of people actually praising him. Just by calling out his name, it is a form of praise. At that time, she heard this name and knew there was someone in the school with that name. She felt that it was negative too. Isn't that guy just a bookworm? How could he send her something? "Yeah, the name is really cheap. The person who gave him the name is even cheaper." Yán Rú Shēng said with a face of disdain, "Thankfully I ate that lollipop for you. It was colorful, all dyed with pigments. At the time, I had a rainbow on my tongue and lips. Junk food, cheap goods." Xū Xū: "..." According to him, she should thank him for eating the things that were sent to her by others? Xū Xū felt angry and funny, she couldn't help it and poked Yán Rú Shēng on the head with her hand, "Yán Rú Shēng, how come you didn't go to heaven?" It's really getting a bargain and selling cute, this is what he likes to do the most. She then looked at him and asked with a smile, "So you used to dislike Director Hao because of his popularity?" Although it was a question, her tone was determined. "..." Yansheng was silent, and it was assumed. Xuxu fell into his deep black eyes again and made an 'uh' sound. Her gaze awkwardly shifted elsewhere. Then she asked, "How did you do all these things? How come I didn't know?" She pouted, as if she was trying to make small talk when she ran out of things to say.
