Yan Rusheng gave her a side-eye and said, "Wen Xuxu, you're so full of yourself." "Am I not good-looking then?" Wen Xuxu frowned, pouting and pretending to be upset. Yan Rusheng was taken aback for a moment, then laughed. The hand that was supporting Xuxu's upper body squeezed her chest firmly. He lowered his head and glared at her, gritting his teeth, "…Cunning, foolish woman." He quickened his pace, walked to the bedside, and without any tenderness, threw Xuxu onto the bed. He then impatiently unbuttoned his shirt, unbuckled his belt, and removed all the restraints from his body before diving under the covers and pressing down on Xuxu. It was simple and rough, not at all romantic. His deep, dark eyes locked with hers, and Xuxu's heartbeat uncontrollably sped up. Yes, after so many years together, every time they looked into each other's eyes like this, her heart would still race like a startled deer, feeling shy and embarrassed. Perhaps it was because they were too familiar with each other that it always felt embarrassing. That's why people say it's hard to make a move on someone you know well, and rabbits don't eat the grass near their burrows. Seeing Xuxu's blushing and shy expression, Yan Rusheng was both excited and annoyed; the excitement came from his body's automatic hormonal reaction, while the annoyance stemmed from his inner thoughts. Although he enjoyed seeing her shy appearance, he didn't like how she would always be so reserved and never take the initiative. "What else do you want to hear? I've told you everything, just look at me." Yan Rusheng held Xuxu's face with both hands, forcing her to meet his gaze. Xuxu's face turned even redder, she pouted, her eyes shifting uneasily, "Then tell me quickly, did you steal other people's love letters to me too?" "Uh…" Yan Rusheng pretended to think, while speaking, "Besides Zhao Zheng's love letters, Jiang Zhuoheng's chocolates and movie tickets, there were also those colorful lollipops from Hao Bang, the son of the police chief from the grade above us." Hearing this, Xuxu was very surprised, "What? Hao Bang?" The one who was called the "praised by thousands" science prodigy? He was called "praised by thousands" because of his name, not because he was actually praised by thousands. Just by calling his name, it meant praising him for being great. At that time, when she heard his name and knew there was someone with such a name at school, she thought it was quite negative. But wasn't that guy just a bookworm? How could he also send her things? "Yeah, this name is really cheap, and the person who came up with it is even cheaper." Yan Rusheng said with a disdainful look on his face, "Fortunately, I ate that lollipop for you. The colorful colors were all dyed with pigments, and it turned my tongue and lips all colorful at the time. It's junk food, cheap stuff." Xuxu: "…" According to him, should she be grateful that he ate the things others had given her? Xuxu felt both angry and amused, and couldn't help but reach out and poke Yan Rusheng's forehead forcefully, "Yan Rusheng, why don't you go to heaven?" He really loved to take advantage of situations and then act innocent; this was his favorite thing to do. After saying that, she looked at him again and asked with a smile, "So, you once didn't like Director Hao because of Hao Bang?" Although she was asking, her tone was certain. "…" Yan Rusheng pursed his lips in silence, which could be considered as admitting it. Xuxu couldn't help but fall into his deep, dark eyes again. She pouted and uttered an 'uh' sound, then her gaze awkwardly shifted elsewhere. Then she asked, "How did you manage to do all these things? How come I didn't know?" She pouted her mouth, as if she was just making conversation.
