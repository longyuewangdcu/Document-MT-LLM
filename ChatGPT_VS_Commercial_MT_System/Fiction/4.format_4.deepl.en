Yan Ruisheng threw her a blank stare, "Wen Xuxu, you're self-obsessed." "Don't I look good?" Wen Xu Xu frowned, beaming and pretending to be angry. The first thing you need to do is to take a look at the actual product. Staring down at her, he gritted his teeth, "...... cunning stupid woman." He quickened his pace, walked to the bed, no pity at all, directly threw Xuxu to the bed, then he unbuttoned his shirt one by one without waiting for a grain. The company's main business is to provide a wide range of products and services to its customers. Simple and rough, not aesthetic at all. The deep black eyes look at her, lifelike's heartbeat uncontrollably accelerated. The actual fact is that you can find a lot of people who have been in the business for many years, and every time you look at him like this, her heart is still like a deer in the headlights, blushing and embarrassed. Perhaps it is too familiar, always feel embarrassed. So people say familiar people are not good to start, rabbits do not eat the grass on the edge of the nest, it really is so. Look at Xuxu blushing and shy, Yan Ruisheng that excitement and chagrin, excitement is his body hormone automatic reaction, chagrin is the law he inside. Although he likes to see her shy look, but do not like her because shy don't squirm, always so reserved, not active. "What else do you want to hear? I tell you all, you look at me." The two hands of Yan Ruisheng held the face of lifelike, hard forced her to meet his eyes. Xu Xu blushed even more, she pouted, her gaze wandered, "Then tell me quickly, did you also steal someone else's love letter to me." "Uh ......" Yan Ruisheng was thinking, while thinking, "In addition to Zhao Zheng's love letters, Jiang Zhuoheng's chocolates and movie tickets, as well as a year higher than us, the Public Security Bureau Hao Director's son Hao Bang's seven-colored Bangtang ." At that, Lifu was surprised, "What? Hao Bang?" The top science student who is known as 'ten thousand people boast'? The reason why it is called 'ten thousand people boast' is because of his name, not really ten thousand people boast him, as long as shouting his name, it is boasting that he is so great. At that time, she heard the name and knew that the school had a person with such a name, also felt good negative. Just that guy is not a nerd? How come he gave her something too? "Yeah, the name is really cheap, and the person who named it is even more cheap." Yan Ruisheng said with a face of contempt, "Fortunately, I ate that lollipop for you, seven colorful colors, all pigment dyed, when I ate my tongue and lips are colorful, junk food, cheap goods." 栩栩："...... "According to him, she has to thank him for eating things given to her on behalf of others? The company's main business is to provide a wide range of products and services to its customers. The actual fact is that you will be able to get a good deal on your own. After saying that, she looked at him again and asked with amusement, "So you used to dislike Chief Hao just because of Hao Bang?" Although it is a question, but the tone is certain. "......" Yan Ruisheng deflated his mouth silent, considered the default. Shu Shu a might as well, and fell into his deep black eyes, she beamed 'uh', her eyes moved elsewhere again awkwardly. Then she asked, "How did you get down with all this? Why don't I know?" She bristled, as if she had nothing to talk about.
