Yan Ru Sheng dumped her a white eye, "Wen Xu Xu, you are narcissistic." "Isn't I look good?" Wen Xu Xu frowned, and he was angry.	 Yan Ru ranged, then laughed, holding the hand with the upper body, and pinched it hard on her chest.	 Staring at her, gritting her teeth, "... cunning stupid woman." He speeded up the pace, walked to the bed, and didn't pity the fragrance at all.	 Unlock the shirt buttons.	 Unbutton the belt, take off all the restraint on the body, then get into the quilt, press it on the body.	 Simple and rude, not beautiful at all.	 The deep black eyes looked at her, and her heartbeat was accelerated without controlling.	 Yes, I have been together for so many years. Whenever I look at him like this, her heart is still like a deer, shame embarrassed. Maybe it's too familiar and always feel embarrassed.	 Therefore, people say that acquaintances are not easy to start, and rabbits do not eat nest grass. This is really the case.	 Looking at Xu Xu's blush and shyness, Yan Ru Sheng was excited and annoyed. Exciting was the automatic response of his hormone in his body. The annoyance was the Fa.	 Although he likes to look at her shy appearance, he doesn't like her because of shyness, always so reserved and not active.	 "What else do you want to listen to? I tell you all, you look at me." Yan Rusheng held his face with his hands, forcing her to look at him.	 Xu Xu's face blushed even more, she held her mouth, her eyes moved, "Then you said, do you still steal the love letter that others gave me." "Uh ..." Yan Rusheng thought about	 Said, "In addition to Zhao Zheng's love letter, Jiang Zhuoheng's chocolate and movie tickets, as well as the colorful sticks of the son of Director Hao, the son of the public security bureau, who are one higher than us."	 ? Hao Zhi? " What is the science champion that is known as the ‘10,000 people’?	 The reason why he is known as ‘10,000 people’ is boasted ’is because of his name, not that he really praises him. As long as he calls his name, he is boasting that he is great.	 At that time, she heard the name and knew that the school had such a person who called such a name, and felt so negative.	 It's just that guy isn't a book nerd?	 How can she give her something?	 "Yeah, the name is really cheap, and the person who names it is even cheaper." Yan Ru Sheng contemplated, "Fortunately, I ate the lollipop for you.	 Well, at that time, I ate my tongue and lips colorful, junk food, cheap goods. "Xu Xu:" ... "As he said, she also thanked him for eating what others gave to her?	 Xu Xu felt so angry and funny, I couldn't help it. He stretched out his hand and poked on the mind of his mind.	 He likes to do it the most. After speaking, she looked at him again and asked funny: "So you used to not like Director Hao because of Hao Ban?" Although he asked, he was determined.	 "..." Yan Ru's lips were silent, which was considered the default.	 Xu Xu, maybe, fell into his deep black eyes again, she slammed his mouth ‘uh’, and his eyes moved embarrassed to other places.	 Then she asked, "How do you start with these? Why don't I know?" She leaned up, as if nothing was looking for something.
