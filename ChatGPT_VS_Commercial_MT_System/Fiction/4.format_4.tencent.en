Yan Rusheng rolled his eyes at her. " Wen Xuxu, you're being narcissistic. " " Don't tell me I'm not pretty? " Wen Xuxu frowned and pouted her lips to pretend to be angry. Yan Rusheng was stunned for a moment before he laughed. He pinched Xuxu's chest forcefully with his hand that was holding her upper body. He lowered his head and glared at her, gritting his teeth. "…You sly and stupid woman. " He quickened his pace and walked to the bed. He didn't have any pity for her and threw Xuxu onto the bed.Then, he unbuttoned his shirt one by one. He unbuttoned his belt and removed all the restraints on his body. Then, he crawled into the blanket and laid on top of Xuxu. It was simple and crude, and it wasn't beautiful at all. His deep black eyes met her gaze, and Xuxu's heart raced uncontrollably. Yes, they had been together for so many years. Every time they looked at each other like this, her heart would still beat wildly and she would feel embarrassed. Perhaps it was because they were too familiar with each other that they felt embarrassed. That was why people said that it was difficult to make a move on an acquaintance. A rabbit wouldn't eat the grass near its nest. It was true. Yan Rusheng was both excited and annoyed when he saw Xuxu blushing and shyness. Excitement was an automatic reaction of his hormones, and annoyance was his way of thinking. Although he liked to see her shy, he didn't like her to be so reserved and reserved because of shyness. " What else do you want to hear? I'll tell you."Look at me." Yan Rusheng cupped Xuxu's face in his hands and forced her to look at him. Xuxu's face turned even redder. She pursed her lips and her gaze shifted."Then tell me quickly, did you steal a love letter from someone else?""What? Hao Bang?" The top scorer in science? The reason why he was known as 'the top scorer' was because of his name, not because of the fact that he was praised by thousands of people. As long as he was called by his name, he was praising him for being awesome. When she heard this name and knew that there was someone with this name in the school, she felt very negative. However, wasn't that guy a bookworm? Why would he give her something?" Fortunately, I ate that lollipop for you. It was all dyed with pigment and my tongue and lips were dyed with all sorts of colors. It was junk food and cheap goods. ""…" According to his words, she had to thank him for eating the food that someone else gave her? Xuxu felt both angry and amused. She couldn't help but poke Yan Rusheng's forehead. " Yan Rusheng, why aren't you going to heaven? " She was really trying to act nice after getting a good deal. He loved to do such things. After saying that, she looked at him again and asked in amusement, "" So, you didn't like Chief Hao because of Hao Bang? " Even though she was asking, her tone was firm. Yan Rusheng pursed his lips and remained silent. It was a tacit agreement. Xuxu hesitated and fell into his deep eyes again. She pouted and looked away awkwardly." How did you do all this? Why didn't I know? " She pursed her lips as if she had nothing to say.
