For a moment, Xiao Mo felt deeply moved and saddened. The Duke seemed... unable to move. Once his body moved, his mind would start to work, and being so smart, how could he not know that Bai Weiwei had already died? He was unwilling to admit it, afraid to think deeply about it, and could only force himself to sit still, convincing himself that Bai Weiwei was just asleep and would wake up. Xiao Mo thought that only when Bai Weiwei's corpse began to rot would the Duke truly regain his sanity, realizing that the person he was holding hands with had been dead for a long time. However, strangely enough, Bai Weiwei's body showed no signs of change. Even her pale face had improved somewhat, and although her body was cold, it was undoubtedly as if she were asleep. There were no signs of a corpse at all. Mu Yanjun watched her, his eyes getting brighter and brighter. Finally, the old quack doctor was brought in, eating a heart-protecting pill, "I guess most of my life is gone." Mu Yanjun hadn't slept for five days, and anyone could see how exhausted he was. However, he was extremely alert, terrifyingly and abnormally so. "After I gave her the medicine, she fell asleep like this. I thought I should invite you to take a look and see when she will wake up," he said. The old doctor sighed and walked to the bedside to take Bai Weiwei's pulse. "Actually, this phenomenon is extremely rare, and there is no need for treatment. However, there is one more very important thing to do..." Mu Yanjun listened attentively, like a diligent student, with a burning fire in his eyes. The old doctor's voice lowered, "That is, I need to treat another person..." Mu Yanjun leaned forward, unwilling to miss any of his words. But in the blink of an eye, the old doctor's hand moved like lightning, and a needle was plunged into Mu Yanjun's neck. Mu Yanjun's eyes widened suddenly, and his hand reached out to strike the old doctor's head. Xiao Mo's hand intercepted and caught Mu Yanjun's attack. In this back and forth, Mu Yanjun couldn't hold on and fainted. The old doctor touched his head, "I almost died. But I guess I won't live long anyway. If he doesn't go mad after waking up, that would be good enough." Bai Weiwei could not be saved. Mu Yanjun's condition was truly heartbreaking, with all of his internal organs experiencing problems. He neither ate nor slept, nor thought, nor moved, no different from the living dead. It was estimated that in another two days, he would join Bai Weiwei in death. Xiao Mo looked at the old doctor, "You are responsible for my master's life. If you can't protect him this time, I will kill you with my own hands." After saying that, she turned and left, heading to the place where they received punishment, silently accepting her penalty. The old doctor sighed, "No wonder my master said that selling sweet potatoes is better than being a miracle doctor. Everyone treats me like a god, but even a god can't make someone who wants to die live on." Mu Yanjun only slept for two hours before opening his eyes. He was startled, his eyes showing a rare panic, but he found himself unable to move. Seeing him awake, the old doctor said, "I was giving you acupuncture. Your mind and spirit are both depleted. After nourishing you, you'll be ready to meet the King of Hell." Mu Yanjun's eyes darkened, his face pale and haggard, but his aura was deadly, making people shudder upon seeing him. The old doctor gave him another needle, "I originally didn't want to save you. After all, someone like you has a vicious heart. Saving you might bring chaos to the world." Mu Yanjun's voice was soft and eerie, "Release me." The old doctor shook his head, "That won't do. I couldn't save the person most important to you, so saving you is a form of compensation." Mu Yanjun suddenly let out a desolate laugh, "You can't compensate, how could you possibly compensate? Even if you saved everyone in this world, you couldn't make up for a single hair of hers." He escaped danger.
