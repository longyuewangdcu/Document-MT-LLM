Little foam for a moment, the heart and soul moved, sad and cut up. The governor this is ...... afraid to move it. Once the body moves, the brain also has to start moving, he is so smart how could not know that Bai Weiwei has died. He did not want to admit it, and did not dare to think deeply, and could only force himself to just sit there, convincing himself that Bai Weiwei was just asleep and would wake up. Small foam felt that only when Bai Weiwei's corpse began to decay, the governor would really regain his senses and know that the person he was holding hands with, had been dead for a long time. But the strange thing is that Bai Weiwei's corpse has not changed at all. Even her pale face was much better, and her body, although cold, was as undoubtedly asleep. Any hint of the characteristics of a corpse did not appear. Mu Yanjun guarded her, his eyes getting brighter and brighter. That divine doctor bad old man was finally escorted, he ate heart protection pills, "This old life of mine is estimated to have gone most of the way." Mu Yanjun had not slept for five days, and anyone could see how exhausted he was physically. But his whole being was abnormally awake, awake in a frightening and abnormal way. "Since she's been sleeping like this since I made her take her medicine, I think it's time to ask you to come and see when she's going to wake up?" The awful old man sighed before walking to the bedside and taking Bai Weiwei's pulse. "In fact, this phenomenon is extremely rare, medical treatment is not needed, but there is a particularly important thing that needs to be done ......" Mu Yanjun listened intently, like a good student seems, with a fire burning in his eyes. The old man's voice lowered, "is that I should heal another person ......" Mu Yanjun body leaned forward, not willing to miss his words. The result is that the bad old man's technique is like electricity, instantly a needle into his neck. Mu Yanjun's eyes snapped open, and his hand had slapped towards the bad old man's heavenly head. Xiao Mo's hand came out horizontally and grabbed Mu Yanjun's attack. This back and forth, Mu Yanjun already can not hold up faint sleep. The bad old man touched his head, "almost died, but I guess I will not live long, he woke up and did not go crazy even if it is good." Bai Weiwei is not saved. And Mu Yanjun's state is simply sad into the heart and soul, the five internal organs are all in trouble. Not eating, not sleeping, not thinking about moving, and the living dead are no different, and then boil a couple of days estimated that people are also lost with Bai Weiwei. Small foam to look at the bad old man, "you protect my governor's life, this time if you can not protect, I killed you with my own hands." After saying that, she turned around and went out towards the place where they received their punishment, and went to be punished in silence. The bad old man sighed, "No wonder my master said, selling sweet potatoes can't be a divine doctor, everyone treats me as a god, even a god can't let a person who wants to die live." Mu Yanjun slept for only two hours before his eyes opened. He was startled, his eyes appeared rare panic, but found himself unable to move. The bad old man saw him awake, "I gave you a needle, your heart and soul are decaying, but give you nourishment, you should go to see the king of hell." Mu Yanjun's eyes gloomy down, his face pale and gaunt, but full of fury, let people shudder to see. The bad old man gave him another needle, "originally did not want to save you, after all, people like you have an incomparably evil heart, save you may be the world to chaos into what." Mu Yanjun's voice was soft and eerie, "Let go of me." The bad old man shook his head, "This is not possible, I can not save your heart, save you is also considered compensation." Mu Yanjun suddenly laughed harshly, "You can't pay, how can you pay, even if you save everyone in this world, you can't pay her a hair." out of danger
