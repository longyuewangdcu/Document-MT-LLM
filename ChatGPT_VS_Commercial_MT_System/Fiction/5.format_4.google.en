For a moment, Xiaomo was full of heart and sadness.	 The master is ... dare not move.	 Once his body moves, his mind is about to move. How could he not know that Bai Weiwei was dead.	 He did not want to admit it, and did not dare to think deeply. He could only force himself to sit like this. He convinced himself that Bai Weiwei just fell asleep and would wake up.	 Xiao Mo felt that only Bai Weiwei's corpse began to rot, and the master of the supervisor would truly restore his mind. He knew that the person he was holding his hand had been dead for a long time.	 But strangely, Bai Weiwei's body did not change.	 Even her pale face was a lot better. Although her body was cold, she had no doubt.	 No trace of corpses appear.	 Mu Yanjun guarded her, her eyes became brighter and brighter.	 The old man of the goddess was finally escorted, and he ate Huxin Pill, "My old life is estimated to go mostly." Mu Yanjun hasn't slept for five days, and everyone can see how tired he is.	 But the whole person was extremely awake, awake and terrible.	 "After letting her take the medicine, she fell asleep like this. I felt that you should ask you to see it, when will she wake up?" The old man sighed before going to the bed and gave Bai Weiwei the pulse.	 "In fact, this phenomenon is extremely rare, but healing is not needed, but there is a particularly important thing to do ..." Mu Yanjun focused on listening, just like a good student, and his eyes were burning.	 The old man's voice was low, "I should heal another person ..." Mu Yanjun leaned forward, and he didn't want to miss him.	 As a result, the old man's technique was like electricity, and he instantly picked into his neck.	 Mu Yanjun's eyes suddenly widened, and his hands had been patted on the old man's Tianling Gai. Xiao Mo's hand ran out of his hand, grabbing Mu Yanjun's attack.	 In this way, Mu Yanjun couldn't help falling asleep.	 The bad old man touched his head, "I almost died, but I guess I couldn't live long. He woke up without crazy, even if he woke up." Bai Weiwei couldn't save it.	 And Mu Yanjun's state is simply sad, and there are problems with the five internal organs.	 Do n’t eat or sleep, do n’t have to sleep, there ’s no different from the living dead. It is estimated that people are gone with Bai Weiwei for two days.	 Xiaomo looked at the bad old man, "You protect the life of my family, if you can't protect it this time, I will kill you by myself." After that, she turned around, walked to the place where they led, and was silently punished.	 Essence	 The bad old man sighed, "No wonder my master said that selling sweet potatoes can not be a god doctor, and everyone treats me as a god, that is, God can't let a person who wants to die." Mu Yanjun just slept only two two times.	 At the time, the eyes opened. He was shocked, his eyes were rarely panicked, but he found that he could not move.	 The old man saw him awake, "I have a needle for you, you have a decline in your mind, but you should be able to see the king of the Yan."	 Seeing it chilling.	 The old man tied him again, "I didn't want to save you, after all, people like you are extremely poisonous, and saved what you may be in the world." Mu Yanjun's voice was soft and weird, ""	 Remove me. "The bad old man shook his head." This is not enough. I can't save your heart, and it is compensated to save you. "Mu Yanjun suddenly laughed.	 Even if you save everyone in this world, you can't pay her hair. "
