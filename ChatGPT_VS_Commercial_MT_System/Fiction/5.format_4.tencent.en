For a moment, Xiao Mo's mind was moved and she started to grieve. The Supervisor…didn't dare to move. Once his body moved, his brain would also start to move. He was so smart, how could he not know that Bai Weiwei was dead? He didn't want to admit it, nor did he dare to think deeply. He could only force himself to sit like this, convincing himself that Bai Weiwei was only asleep and would wake up. Xiao Mo felt that only when Bai Weiwei's corpse began to rot would the Supervisor truly regain his rationality. He knew that the person he was holding hands with ...She had been dead for a long time. However, the strange thing was that Bai Weiwei's body had not changed at all. Her pale face had even improved a lot. Although her body was cold, she was undoubtedly asleep. There were no signs of a corpse. Mu Yanjun watched over her, his eyes shining brighter and brighter. The divine doctor was finally brought over. He took a heart-protecting pill. " I think I've lost half my life. " Mu Yanjun hadn't slept for five days. Everyone could see how tired he was. However, he was unusually awake. He was terrifyingly and abnormally awake. " She fell asleep after I gave her the medicine. I think I should invite you to come and see when she wakes up. " The disheveled old man sighed and walked to the bed to take Bai Weiwei's pulse. " Actually, this phenomenon is extremely rare. There's no need for medical treatment.However, there's still one more important thing that needs to be done…" Mu Yanjun listened attentively, like a good student. His eyes were burning with fire. The disheveled old man's voice lowered. " It's just that I should treat another person…" Mu Yanjun leaned forward, unwilling to miss his words. The disheveled old man's technique was like lightning, and the needle instantly pierced into his neck. Mu Yanjun's eyes widened, and his hand was already slapping the disheveled old man's head. Bubbly Foam's hand stretched out and caught Mu Yanjun's attack. Mu Yanjun could not hold on any longer and fell asleep. The disheveled old man rubbed his head. " He almost died, but I don't think I'll live for long. It's good that he didn't go crazy when he woke up. " Bai Weiwei couldn't be saved. Mu Yanjun's state was so sad that his internal organs had problems. He didn't eat, sleep, or think. He was no different from a living dead.Bubbly Foam looked at the disheveled old man. " You protected the life of my Supervisor. If you can't protect him this time, I'll kill you myself. " She turned around and walked towards the place where they were being punished. The disheveled old man sighed. " No wonder my master said that selling sweet potatoes can't be a godly doctor. Everyone treats me like a god. Even a god can't let a person who wants to die live. " Mu Yanjun only slept for four hours before his eyes opened. He was shocked. It was rare for him to show panic in his eyes, but he realized that he could not move. The disheveled old man saw that he had woken up. " I'm giving you an injection. Your mind is weak. However, if I give you rest, you should go to see the King of Hell. " Mu Yanjun's eyes darkened. His face was pale and haggard, but he was filled with a murderous aura that made people shudder. The disheveled old man gave him another injection. " I didn't want to save you at first. After all, people like you are extremely vicious." If I save you, the world might turn into chaos. " Mu Yanjun's voice was gentle and strange. " Let go of me. " The disheveled old man shook his head. " That won't do. I can't save the person in your heart. Saving you is considered compensation. " Mu Yanjun suddenly laughed bitterly. " You can't pay for it, how can you? Even if you save everyone in the world, you can't pay for a single hair on her head. " She was out of danger.
