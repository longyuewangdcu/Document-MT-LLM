The situation has reversed and both sides are firing with all their might, and the entire sky above the ocean is filled with smoke. White Night's high-speed magnetic wave scanning gun fired again, and another plane was shattered by him. This gun is really useful, and he's addicted to using it. The little milk bag is commanding confidently, and the air force of the first terrorist organization forms an indestructible offensive and defensive team, and begins the final round of fierce attack. Nickla saw that the situation was not good and didn't care about dignity, and his voice rose, "Master, retreat, if we continue to fight like this, we will be defeated." Louis fists clenched tight, his face was dark, and he was full of resentment. He couldn't see the current situation. But he was unwilling, being defeated like this, when victory was so close, he could retrieve them. What a shame. The man's jade green eyes swept over the killing intent, and then disappeared into those quiet and melancholy eyes. He nodded to Nickla, and he immediately ordered to cover the retreat. Louis glared at the two people floating in the sky, sneered coldly, this time they were lucky, he wouldn't let it end like this. "Baby, they're retreating, pursue?" White Night laughed lightly. He has a special affection for the magnetic wave scanning gun, and he holds it like a child. The corners of his lips lift a calm and dangerous smile. The little milk bag also smiled elegantly, ordered to stop the attack, and in the dark big eyes, there was a calmness, slowly saying: "Don't pursue, let him die like this, it's too much of a waste. The game of cat catching mouse has just begun." This game has already reversed the situation. Louis, he should never have provoked him. The death of Nuno, he must find someone to accompany the funeral, otherwise he won't be able to swallow this anger. When the game starts, Louis calls the shots, but... Little milk bag's laughter is cold and sharp, what's the end, he decides. White night smiles, elegant and carefree, "Agreed, no pursuit. We have enough capital to play with him. Maybe it's not their turn to take action, Louis might have someone eager to clean up." Little milk bag looks at the direction of their escape, coldly laughing without a word. "Chuli, it's over, no need for support, we're going back immediately." White night and Chuli had a phone call and ordered their subordinates to turn back to Rome. Black Eagle and others exhausted all their strength to drag Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya up, they all knew that Cheng Anya had a virus and had already taken protective measures, Ye Sanshao also warned them that he also had a virus, Black Eagle and others were even more careful with Ye Sanshao lying down, panting like a bull, couldn't help but kick Cheng Miss, "Little Anya, you need to lose weight, you'll die if you're too heavy." His whole shoulder was a little numb, because he had been swimming in seawater for a long time, consumed a lot of energy, and then hung Cheng Anya so swaying, it really was a hassle for his arms. He almost didn't catch her and dropped her into the sea, and he still feels a little frightened when he thinks about that scene. Black Hawk and others cheered for their safety, passing towels, pouring hot water, everyone was busy, and someone took the opportunity to joke with Ye San Shao about how he was spending these days. The plane was lively, men were together, and there was a sense of bravery. Cheng Anya wiped her hair with the towel that Black Hawk passed to her, and wrapped herself in a blanket to keep warm. Her ears automatically blocked out his words. Finally, she was safe. She sneezed and couldn't help but wrap herself up tighter. Black Hawk laughed and said, "San Shao, if the lady gets any skinnier, you'll complain she's just bones." "I'm complaining now," Ye San Shao also got up, dried the sea water on his body, "That's why it's so heavy, just because of bones." Cheng Anya continued to uphold the virtue of silence is golden, Black Hawk found two sets of clothes for them to change into. Because it was men's clothes, it was funny to see them on Miss Cheng. She simply wrapped herself in a blanket. Just after changing clothes, Black Hawk told her that Ning Ning wanted to talk to her. Cheng Anya eagerly grabbed the microphone, "Baby, it's Mommy." "Hi, Mommy, have you missed your baby?" Little milk bag sat on the sofa, chatting with Cheng Anya with a smiling face, it's been a long time since she heard her mom's voice, it's strange to miss her. "Not at all." Cheng Anya snorted coldly, showing a fierce tone, "You're too inexperienced, it's so late to find Mommy, you should be beaten." Ning Ning thought of the promise, and her heart choked, and instead she smiled, "Okay, baby will take the call, when I return to Rome, you can beat me however you like, I really miss Mommy, Mommy, you don't love me too much, I despise you." "Despise back." Cheng Anya laughed, and asked worriedly, "Are you hurt?" "No, I'm fine, nothing has happened, don't worry." Ning Ning smiled and said, "Mommy, the plane is about to land, talk in a minute." "Okay." Little milk bag closed the communicator, Cheng Anya drank hot water to warm herself up, and Ye Sanshao was originally eagerly looking forward to chatting with his son, but he couldn't chat and it was disconnected, he was very unhappy, and his eyes looked at Cheng Anya in protest. Miss Cheng calmly ignored him. The Black Hawk laughed and said, "Third Young Master, the plane is landing soon, we'll be able to see Young Master in a moment." Ye San Sha felt thoroughly ignored and couldn't help but pull Miss Cheng, "Conscienceless little thing." "Stingy." Cheng An Ya laughed and scolded him, giving him hot water. Ye San Sha drank the remaining hot water from Miss Cheng's cup. If there was a bit of alcohol to warm up, it would be even more wonderful. The plane soon landed, all landing in the castle. Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, and others were all there. Upon seeing that Ye San Sha and Cheng An Ya were safe, everyone finally relaxed. "Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, you two are really in a mess..." Ye Wei laughed so hard that her arms were shaking, "Third Brother, I should take a photo as a memento." "Stinky girl." Ye San Sha scolded with a smile. As long as Wei Wei, Eleven, and the little baby were safe, he finally felt relieved. After putting in so much effort, how could there still be any accidents? Little Milk Bag excitedly wanted to hug Cheng Anya, but she sternly stopped him. Only then did he remember that his mother was carrying a virus, and Black Hawk had already said so. Then he looked at his father and mother holding hands, his heart sank slightly. "Daddy, Mommy, you both... White Night, you help them take a look quickly." Little Milk Bag's first reaction was to find White Night. He was a genius doctor, and there was no disease that he couldn't cure. "I know, I know, don't worry." White Night smiled. "Virus?" A blonde handsome man with blue eyes blinked his eyes. "Little White, isn't this your strong point?" Little White? White Night twisted his wrist and smiled in a charming and gentle manner. "Jason, try calling me Little White again?" "...F*ck, what's wrong with calling you Little White? It's already Little White, you guys also call me Black Jack." Jason, who is known as the Fire-Breathing Dragon, shoots fire on the spot, like a golden lion king, but equally handsome and irritating. Especially those blue eyes, they shine like blue gems. When angry, there's a chill-inducing aura, like a volcanic eruption, with a very apparent dominance. Black Jack, who is a young man in his twenties, is delicate in appearance. He's a mixed-race of Chinese and British descent, with mysterious Eastern facial features and deep Western features, with a pair of gray-blue eyes that always look hazy and dreamy, giving people a sentimental illusion.But upon closer examination, you will find that he is extremely sensitive and has a hidden reserved demeanor. The two leaders of the first terror organization are not old, but have different personalities. Their aura is strong, with one of them having a dominant presence as if ruling the world, let alone when all three of the big leaders are present. This line of sight is visually stunning. "Jason, you really need repair." Eleven snorted, "Don't call me by name, call me Little White, Little White, hit him." Ye Wei looked at them and shook her head, "Three elder brother, Three elder sister, don't pay attention to them. You should still take a hot bath and check later, so as not to get sick." She summoned the maid to take Ye Chen and Cheng Anya to wash, and although the little girl wanted to follow, she stayed here. White Night was about to hit someone, and the little girl quickly grabbed his sleeve. "White Night, can you find a way to save my dad and mom?" The child's eyes are bright, like two black grapes inlaid on a white and tender face, full of anticipation, as if White Night shook his head, the light in his eyes would fade. Jason picked up the little baby and hugged him in his arms, full of bravery, "Baby, don't worry, White Night can save even dead people, let alone living people, you worry about nothing, come over when you have time and blow up the protection of the Black Hand gang for me." "Who was just questioning White Night's medical skills?" Black Jack expressed doubt, Jason hit him with a palm, but he dodged agilely. The little baby was held by the tall man, abnormally tangled, kicked Jason, "Put me down." "I also want such a son, Ning Ning, come be my son? I have been longing for you for a long time." Jason's blue eyes burst with surging light, alive like the little baby is a piece of fat meat. Everyone, "..." White Night smiled and said, "Jason, let your mom teach you Chinese again, don't keep saying that the commander can't use words, you are not going anywhere either." "I'm not on the same level as the commander, am I?" Jason was very dissatisfied with someone connecting him with the commander. The so-called official bandits are not of the same kind, this is a principle problem. Little baby struggled a bit, and Jason put him down. Little baby asked, "Baiye..." "Ningning, wait for me to give them an examination before we can determine anything, don't be anxious." Baiye said, rubbing little baby's head, "I promise to do my best." Little baby, who had just lost the promise, and his parents' life and death couldn't be guaranteed, no matter how calm he was, he was still uneasy. He couldn't lose them again. Baiye understood his current mental state very well. "Don't worry too much." Baiye said. Ye Wei said, "Alright, leave it to Baiye. There is no problem in the world that cannot be solved. Since Louis can research the virus, there must be a cure, it cannot be unsolvable. If Baiye can't solve it, take his signature." Chu Li smiled, "I agree." "Little White, do you have a signature?" Jason expressed deep doubt. He always didn't know what his signature was. Eleven really wanted to punch him. "Speaking of this, how come you two didn't catch Louis coming back?" Jack asked. "The guy is dead and we've been at peace for a long time." "I've been wanting to kill him for a long time, these days the gangs are challenging each other all over the place, this guy's headquarters has been bombed and he still has the heart to play the long-standing grudges, it's really stupid." "Louis isn't in a hurry," Little Milk Pack said slowly, with a dangerous curve on his face. Those jet-black pupils were filled with calculating light. "Victory without fighting is the highest level of victory. He and I have personal grudges, but the struggle between the gang and the terrorist organizations is another matter. To destroy the gang, we will have to spend a lot of money and resources. After this, his position in the gang is shaky, I have always suspected that there is a power hidden in the gang that we can't see. Otherwise, the gang wouldn't have let Louis take such action to destroy himself. Since that's the case, let Louis lead the way for us, uncover this power and destroy it with one strike." What a cunning person... This is what everyone thinks. Although they know that he is always very cunning and treacherous, because he is too young, everyone inevitably spoils him, and combined with his pink and tender appearance, people always neglect his nature. "Treacherous!" Jason raised his thumb. He is always a man of action and doesn't think too much like others. But most of the time, he listens to the plans of Black Jack and Chuli. He always follows the plans of Little Milk Bag even more. A man of action also has a strong team of advisors, and their power is quite terrifying. "I agree with Ning Ning's method," Chuli said, he and White Night always agree with his ideas, "once and for all, so that no one will be ignorant and always come to provoke us." "Ning Ning, when have you ever contradicted, acting like a traitor?" Black Jack laughed, "but this time, we should give the Mafia a lesson, let them avoid us for fifty years if they see us." White Night nodded, he also had no objections. The most important thing for him was to cure the viruses on Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anyan. That was crucial, and the rest could be left to Chuli. Ye Wei and Eleven looked at each other, another force? They both had a vague idea of who it might be, Mo Ye and Mo Jue? In the Mafia, only they have enough charisma and are unpredictable. They could not think of anyone else who could have such courage. Louis, who was supposed to be superior to everyone, should not be taking orders from him. Everyone moved to the living room, Little Nai-Bao went to find Cheng Anya, just as she finished taking a bath, had a cup of hot tea and was feeling warm and cozy. She was lying on the bed, looking at her fingers with a thoughtful expression. "Mommy..." Little Nai-Bao pushed the door open and walked in with a smile. Cheng Anya snapped back to reality, squinting her eyes and praised, "Baby, you really have style." This outfit really had a powerful impact, and there wasn't a trace of a child, it was like a dangerous person. "Thank you, Mommy, for the compliment," said Little Nai-Bao. "Don't come too close, sit further away, I'm afraid I won't be able to resist hitting you," Cheng Anya pointed to the sofa across from her, "Sit over there." Little Nai-Bao glared at Cheng Anya with resentment, "Mommy, you're rejecting me." "Exactly," replied Cheng Anya. Cheng Anye laughed and looked at Little Milk Bag. She always felt that there was something different about this child, even though it looked no different from the past. But mothers are the ones who understand their children the most. No matter how well hidden the changes on their bodies are, she can still feel them. "Mommy, why are you looking at me like this? Do you think I'm handsome?" Little Milk Bag mischievously blinked his eyes, and his expression was extremely cute. Cheng Anye glared at him, smiling but not smiling. "You've learned 8 or 9 points of your father's self-love skills. Are you okay lately? Tell Mommy the truth, are you being bullied?" Little Milk Bag shook his head. "No." "Nonsense, Lewis showed me a picture, clearly beaten all over with blood," Cheng Anye obviously didn't believe it and gritted her teeth, "I don't hate him for being cut a thousand times." Thinking about everything she had experienced before, Cheng Anye hated Louis deeply in her heart. Her bright face was covered with a layer of coldness, and when she thought of what Little Milk Bag had gone through, she had an even worse premonition. "Mommy, I'm really okay. Most of it was probably fabricated by him." The Little Bun elegantly smiled, rolled up his sleeves, revealing a white and tender arm, "Look, there isn't a single scar." The bullet wounds on his arm had healed quite nicely, and he wasn't afraid of Cheng Anya finding out. The whip marks he had received were all promises left behind by Xu Nuo, and since they were inflicted by Xu Nuo, he didn't feel like he was being bullied. Instead, he felt a little nostalgic for the pain he used to feel when she hit him. If Xu Nuo were still alive, he would have willingly let her beat him like this for the rest of his life. "Ningning, are you really okay?" Cheng Anya frowned, and didn't miss the pain that flashed through her son's eyes. The Little Bun nodded, "I'm really fine, Mom. What's wrong is you and Dad. Uncle Black Hawk said you have a virus and Dad got it too?" Cheng Anya remembered the worm-filled Ye Sanhao, and her cheeks turned red again. She no longer had the desire or intention to speak, "Don't bring it up. We jumped a plane in the desert and another one on the sea, how could we not have come in contact?" Miss Cheng spoke very calmly, and Little Bun didn't doubt her. "Mom, it'll be okay, White Night's medical skills are so advanced, there must be a way to save you guys."
