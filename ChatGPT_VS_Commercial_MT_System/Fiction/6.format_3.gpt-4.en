The situation was one-sided, with both sides going all out and firing, filling the entire sky above the ocean with gun smoke. Bai Ye's high-speed magnetic wave scanning gun fired again, shattering another aircraft. The gun was so useful that he was becoming addicted to it. Xiao Naibao commanded calmly as the air force of the First Terrorist Organization formed an indestructible offensive and defensive team, launching their final round of fierce attacks. Upon seeing the unfavorable situation, Nikola couldn't care about hierarchy and raised his voice, "Master, let's retreat. If we continue like this, our entire army will be wiped out." Louis clenched his fists tightly, his face gloomy and his whole body full of anger. He could see the situation clearly, but he was unwilling to be driven back like this, especially when his goal was so close. He could have recaptured them, but it was all ruined now, which was infuriating. The man's emerald green eyes flashed with murderous intent, then it hid within his deep, melancholic gaze. He nodded at Nikola, who immediately ordered a covering retreat. Louis stared at the two of them drifting in the sky above the sea and snorted coldly, thinking they were lucky this time, but he wouldn't let it go so easily. "Baby, they're retreating. Shall we pursue?" Bai Ye chuckled lightly, holding the magnetic wave scanning gun like a beloved child, the corner of his lips curled into a faint yet dangerous smile. Xiao Naibao also smiled gracefully, ordered to stop the attack, and said slowly with a calm and dark gaze, "No pursuit. It would be a pity to let them die just like this. The cat and mouse game has just begun." This game had already turned the tide. Louis shouldn't have provoked him at all. To avenge Nono's death, he had to find someone to accompany him in the grave; otherwise, he couldn't swallow his anger. As for when the game began, Louis had the final say, but... Xiao Naibao's smile was cold and sharp, as for when it ended, he had the final say. Bai Ye smiled and waved his hand casually, "Alright, no pursuit. We have plenty of capital to play with him. Maybe it won't even be our turn to take action before someone else is eager to clean up Louis." Xiao Naibao looked in the direction of their escape and sneered silently. "Chu Li, it's over. No need for backup. We're going back right away." Bai Ye called Chu Li and ordered his men to return to Rome. Black Hawk and the others had used all their strength to pull Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya up. They knew Cheng Anya was infected with a virus and had already taken protective measures. Ye Sanshao also warned them that he was infected as well, so Black Hawk and the others were extremely cautious. Ye Sanshao lay there, panting heavily, and couldn't help but kick Miss Cheng, "Little Anya, you need to lose some weight. You're so heavy." His entire shoulder was a bit numb because he had swum in the sea for a long time, consuming a lot of energy, and carrying Cheng Anya like that was quite a strain on his arm. He almost didn't catch her and dropped her into the sea. Recalling that scene still sent shivers down his spine. Black Hawk and the others cheered for their safety, passing out towels and pouring hot water. Everyone was busy, and some even joked about how Ye Sanshao had been doing these days. The atmosphere on the plane was lively, with men gathered together, there was an air of boldness. Cheng Anya took the towel from Black Hawk to dry her hair, then wrapped herself in a blanket to warm her cold body. She automatically blocked out their conversation with her ears. Finally, she was safe. She sneezed and couldn't help but wrap herself tighter in the blanket. Black Hawk chuckled and said, "Third Master, if the lady were any thinner, you would complain that she's all bones." "I'm complaining now," Ye Sanshao also got up and wiped the seawater off his body, "It's because she's bony that she's so heavy." Cheng Anya continued to uphold the virtue of silence being golden. Black Hawk found two sets of clothes for them to change into. Since they were men's clothes, they looked quite comical on Miss Cheng, so she simply wrapped herself in the blanket. As soon as they changed their clothes, Black Hawk told her that Ningning wanted to talk to her. Cheng Anya excitedly grabbed the microphone, "Baby, it's mommy." "Hi, mommy, do you miss your baby?" Xiao Naibao sat on the sofa with a smile on his face, chatting with Cheng Anya. He hadn't heard his mommy's voice in a long time and missed her a lot. "Not at all," Cheng Anya snorted coldly, revealing a fierce tone, "You're too slow. You only found mommy this late. You deserve a spanking." Ningning thought of Xu Nuo, and his heart skipped a beat, then he smiled, "Alright, baby will take the spanking. When we get back to Rome, you can hit me however you want. I really miss mommy. Mommy, you don't love me enough. I despise you." "I despise you back," Cheng Anya laughed and asked worriedly, "You're not injured, are you?" "No, I'm fine. Nothing happened to me, don't worry," Ningning smiled and said, "Mommy, the plane is about to land. We'll talk later." "Okay." Xiao Naibao turned off the communicator, and Cheng Anya drank some hot water to warm her body. Ye Sanshao had been looking forward to chatting with his son, but the call ended before he had a chance to talk. He was very dissatisfied and looked at Cheng Anya with accusing eyes. Miss Cheng calmly ignored him, and Black Hawk laughed, "Third Master, the plane is about to land. You'll be able to see the young master soon." Ye Sanshao felt thoroughly ignored and couldn't help but pinch Miss Cheng, "You ungrateful little thing." "Stingy," Cheng Anya laughed and scolded, handing him the hot water. Ye Sanshao shared Miss Cheng's cup and drank the remaining hot water. It would be even more wonderful if they had some alcohol to warm their bodies at this moment. The plane landed quickly, and everyone descended at the castle. Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, and others were all there. Seeing Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya safe, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. "Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, you two are in such a sorry state..." Ye Wei laughed with her flowers trembling, "Third Brother, I should have taken a picture as a souvenir." "You naughty girl," Ye Sanshao laughed and scolded. With Weiwei, Eleven, and Xiao Naibao all safe, he finally felt at ease. After all the effort they had put in, how could anything else go wrong? Xiao Naibao happily wanted to hug Cheng Anya but was stopped by her stern order. It was then that he remembered that his mommy had a virus on her, as Black Hawk had already mentioned. He then looked at his daddy and mommy's hands clasped together, and his heart sank slightly. "Daddy, mommy, you both... Bai Ye, quickly check on them." Xiao Naibao's first reaction was to find Bai Ye, as he was a genius doctor, and there was no illness he couldn't cure. "I got it, I got it, don't worry," Bai Ye laughed. "A virus?" A handsome blonde-haired, blue-eyed guy blinked, "Xiao Bai, this isn't your strong suit, is it?" Xiao Bai? Bai Ye twisted his wrist and laughed gracefully and gently, "Jason, want to try calling me Xiao Bai again?" "...Damn, what's wrong with calling you Xiao Bai? You're originally Xiao Bai, and you guys also call Black Jack Xiao Tie." Known as the Fire Dragon, Jason erupted with anger on the spot, looking like a golden-haired lion king, but still handsome enough to make people jealous. Especially those sky-blue eyes, as dazzling as sapphires. When angry, he exuded a kind of chilling aura, as if a volcano was erupting, with a very overt dominance. Black Jack, standing nearby, was a young man in his twenties, very delicate-looking. He was of Chinese and British mixed heritage, with the mysterious features of Eastern people and the deep features of Westerners. He had a pair of gray-blue eyes, always appearing misty, giving people an illusion of deep affection, but upon closer inspection, you would find that he was extremely sharp, with a deeply hidden restraint. The two leaders of the first terrorist organization were not old, with very different personalities, but both had a strong presence. Each had a king-like demeanor, let alone having all three major leaders here. Looking down the line, it was quite a visual impact. "Jason, you really need to be taught a lesson." Eleven snorted, "What's wrong with calling him Xiao Bai? Xiao Bai, beat him up." Ye Wei glanced at them and shook her head, "Third brother, third sister-in-law, don't mind them. You two should take a hot bath first, and then get checked later to avoid getting sick." She called a maid to take Ye Chen and Cheng Anya to wash up. Although Xiao Naibao really wanted to follow, he stayed here instead, as Bai Ye pretended to beat someone up, and Xiao Naibao hurriedly grabbed his sleeve. "Bai Ye, do you have a way to save my daddy and mommy?" The child's eyes were very bright, like two black grapes embedded in his fair face, full of hope. It seemed as if the light in his eyes would dim if Bai Ye shook his head. Jason grabbed Xiao Naibao and hugged him, full of confidence, "Baby, don't worry. Xiao Bai can even save the dead, let alone living people. You have nothing to worry about. If you have time, come and help me attack the Mafia's defense." "Who was just questioning Bai Ye's medical skills?" Black Jack expressed his doubts, and Jason slapped him, but he swiftly dodged. Xiao Naibao, being held by the tall man, felt very conflicted and kicked Jason, "Put me down." "I wish I had a son like this too. Ning Ning, would you like to be my son? I've been coveting you for a long time." Jason's deep blue eyes burst with radiance, as if Xiao Naibao were a piece of delicious meat. Everyone, "..." Bai Ye smiled and said, "Jason, let your mom teach you Chinese again. Don't always say that the commander doesn't know how to use words; you're not much better." "Am I even on the same level as the commander?" Jason was very dissatisfied with someone linking him to the commander, as the saying goes, "officials and bandits are not from the same family," which was a matter of principle. Xiao Naibao struggled a bit, and Jason let him down. Xiao Naibao asked, "Bai Ye..." "Ning Ning, I need to perform an examination on them before I can be sure. Don't worry for now," Bai Ye said, rubbing Xiao Naibao's head, "I promise to do my best." Xiao Naibao had just lost Xu Nuo, and the uncertain life and death situation of his parents made him uneasy, no matter how calm he appeared. He couldn't lose them as well, and Bai Ye understood his current state of mind. "Don't worry too much," Bai Ye said. Ye Wei said, "Alright, leave it to Bai Ye. There is no problem in this world that cannot be solved. Since Louis was able to develop the virus, there must be an antidote. It's impossible that there is no solution. If Bai Ye can't solve it, we'll take down his signboard." Chu Li laughed, "I agree." "Xiao Bai, do you have a signboard?" Jason asked doubtfully, as he had never known that he had a signboard. Shi Yi really wanted to punch him. "Speaking of which, why didn't you two catch Louis and bring him back?" Hei Jack asked, "If this guy dies early, we can be at ease." "I've wanted to eliminate him for a long time. Recently, the Mafia has been provoking us everywhere. Even with his headquarters being bombed, he still has the mood to play around with love affairs. He is really incompetent." "Louis is not in a hurry," Xiao Naibao slowly said, a dangerous curve appearing on his face, and his pitch-black eyes were filled with calculating glimmers. "To win without fighting is the highest level of victory. Our personal enmity with him is one thing, but the struggle between the Mafia and the terrorist organization is another. To annihilate the Mafia, we would need to spend a lot of financial and material resources. After this, his position in the Mafia is shaky. I have always suspected that there is another force within the Mafia hidden in a place we can't see. Otherwise, they would not allow Louis to engage in such self-destructive actions. In that case, let's let Louis lead the way for us, expose this force, and eliminate them in one fell swoop." Cunning... That was the unanimous thought of everyone. Although they knew that he was always scheming and treacherous, because of his young age, everyone couldn't help but spoil him. Plus, with his delicate and tender appearance, people would often overlook his true nature. "Scheming!" Jason gave a thumbs up. He was always a man of action, not one to think as much as others, but most of the time, he would listen to Hei Jack and Chu Li's plans. He would always follow Xiao Naibao's plans without question. A strong man of action backed by a powerful group of strategists is a formidable force. "I agree with Ning Ning's method," Chu Li said. He and Bai Ye had always agreed with Xiao Naibao's ideas, "Let's solve the problem once and for all, so that people who don't know their own limitations will stop provoking us." "When has Ning Ning ever been refuted by you? You guys are in cahoots," Hei Jack laughed. "But this time, it's indeed necessary to teach the Mafia a lesson, so that they will avoid us for the next fifty years." Bai Ye nodded, having no objections. His primary concern was to cure the virus in Ye Sanshao and Cheng An Ya. Everything else was up to Chu Li.  Ye Wei and Eleven exchanged glances. Another force? The faces of Mo Ye and Mo Jue came to their minds simultaneously. In the Mafia, only they had enough influence and were mysterious enough. They couldn't think of anyone else who would have such power, who should have been above Louis in the first place and wouldn't have been under his command. Everyone moved to the living room, while Xiao Naibao went to find Cheng An Ya. She had just finished a warm bath and drank a cup of hot tea, feeling warm and cozy. Her cheeks were flushed with a hint of pink as she sat on the bed, lost in thought while looking at her fingers. "Mommy..." Xiao Naibao pushed the door open and walked in with a smile. Cheng An Ya came back to her senses, squinted her eyes, and praised, "My dear, you really have style." This outfit truly had an imposing air, with no trace of a child's innocence, making him look like a dangerous character. "Thank you for the compliment, Mommy." "Don't come close. Sit further away, I'm afraid I won't be able to resist hitting you," Cheng An Ya pointed to the sofa across the room. "Sit there." Xiao Naibao glared at Cheng An Ya resentfully, "Mommy, you're rejecting me." "Exactly," she replied. Cheng An Ya laughed and glanced at Xiao Naibao. She always felt that there was something different about the child. Although he looked the same as before, a mother knows her child best, and she could sense any changes in him no matter how well they were hidden. "Mommy, why are you looking at me like that? Do you think your baby has become handsome?" Xiao Naibao playfully blinked his eyes, looking extremely adorable. Cheng An Ya gave him a half-smile, "You've certainly learned eight or nine points of your father's narcissism. Have you been okay during this time? Tell your mommy the truth. Have you been bullied?" Xiao Naibao shook his head, "No." "Nonsense, Louis showed me pictures of you covered in blood," Cheng An Ya clearly didn't believe him, gritting her teeth in anger, "Even if he's cut a thousand times, I won't be satisfied." Recalling everything she had experienced, Cheng An Ya harbored immense hatred for Louis. Her radiant face was covered with a layer of coldness, and thinking of Xiao Naibao's past experiences, she had an even worse premonition. "Mommy, I'm really fine. Most of it was probably synthesized by him." Xiao Naibao smiled elegantly, rolled up his sleeve, and revealed a fair and tender arm. "Look, there's not a single scar." The gunshot wounds on his arm had mostly healed, and he wasn't afraid of Cheng An Ya discovering them. As for the whip wounds he once had, they were left by Xu Nuo. Since it was Xu Nuo who had beaten him, he didn't feel bullied. On the contrary, he somewhat missed the pain from being beaten by her. If Nuo Nuo could be alive, he'd willingly be beaten by her for the rest of his life. "Ning Ning, are you really okay?" Cheng An Ya's eyebrows furrowed, not missing the flash of pain in her son's eyes. Xiao Naibao nodded, "I'm really fine, Mommy. The ones in trouble are you and Daddy. Uncle Heiying said that there's a virus in your body, and Daddy has been infected too?" Cheng An Ya thought of Ye Sanshao, who had been lustful, and her cheeks turned red again. She didn't even want to mention desire. "Don't mention it. We jumped out of a plane in the desert and jumped again in the sea. How could we not be in contact?" Miss Cheng spoke calmly, and Xiao Naibao didn't doubt her words. "Mommy, everything will be fine. Baiye's medical skills are so brilliant; he will definitely find a way to save you both."
