As the situation fell, both sides opened the fire, and there was a smoke over the entire ocean.	 The high -speed magnetic wave scanning gun in Bai Ye fired again, and another plane was broken by him. This gun was really easy to use. He used it with addiction.	 The offensive and defensive team started the last round of attack.	 When the situation was not good at the time of the situation, he couldn't take care of his inferiority, and his voice became louder.	 He was full of anger, and he couldn't see the current situation.	 But he was unwilling to be retired like this. He was close at hand, and he could catch them back.	 The man's emerald green eyes crossed the murderous and turned into the silent and melancholy eyes. He nodded towards Nicholas, and he immediately ordered the cover to retreat.	 Louis stared at the two who were floating over the sea and hummed coldly. This time, they were lucky, and he would not just count it.	 "Baby, are they going to retreat and chase?" Bai Ye laughed, and he had a soft spot for this magnetic wave scanning gun. Holding it like holding a child, his lips were gone indifferent and dangerous.	 The little milk bag also smiled elegantly and ordered to stop attacking. The dark eyes were quiet and said slowly: "If you don't chase, let him die like this, it is a pity that the cat catching the mouse's game has just begun." This is the beginning. "This is the beginning."	 The game game has reversed the situation. Louis, he shouldn't mess with him, Nuo's death, he had to find someone to be buried, otherwise he couldn't swallow it.	 When did the game start, Louis said the final say, but ... the little milk bag smiled coldly, and it was compelling. When did he finish?	 Bai Ye smiled, and she was smart, "Success, not chasing, we have capital to play with him, maybe they can't turn them, and some people will be in a hurry to clean up." The small milk bag looked at the direction they escaped, and sneered without sneering.	 language.	 "Chu Li, it's over, don't support it, let's go back immediately." Bai Ye and Chu Li made a call and ordered his men to turn back to Rome.	 Black Hawk and others abolished the power of nine cows and two tigers to drag Ye San Shao and Cheng Anya. They all knew that Cheng Anya had a virus on her body.	 Black Hawk and others were be careful of the wing -wing leaf lying down, panting like a cow, and couldn't help kicking Miss Cheng, "Xiao Anya, you have to lose weight, and he died heavy." His entire shoulder was a little numb,	 Because I swam in the sea for a long time, I consume a lot of physical energy, and then hanging Cheng Anya is so fluttering, it is really enough to toss her arms. I almost caught her and left her to the sea. Recalling the picture, he still felt a little hipmed.	 Black Hawk and others cheered because of their safety. They handed towels to the towels and poured hot water with hot water. They were too busy to live, and there were people who were in the time when they were in the time.	 The plane is very lively, and men are together.	 Cheng Anya wiped her hair with a towel handed over with the Black Hawk, and wrapped her cold body with a blanket, and she automatically shielded him in both ears. She was finally safe.	 A bit.	 The Black Eagle laughed and said, "San Shao, your wife is thinner, you have to think of her pork ribs." "I have disgusted it now." Ye San Shao also got up and wiped the sea water on his body, "It is because of the pork ribs so heavy.	 "Cheng Anya continued to carry forward the virtue of Silence. The Black Eagle found two sets of clothes for them, because it was a man's clothes. It was funny to wear on Miss Cheng. She simply wrapped herself with a blanket.	 As soon as she changed her clothes, Black Hawk told her that Ning Ning wanted to talk to her.	 Cheng Anya grabbed the microphone excitedly, "Baby, it's mommy." "Hi, Mommy, do you want your baby?" The little milk bag sat on the sofa with a smile on her face and chatted with Cheng Anya. I haven't listened to her mother's voice for a long time.	 "I don't want to." Cheng Anya hummed coldly, showing a fierce tone, "You are too vegetable, you can find Mommy so late, it's time to fight." Ning Ning thought of promise, suffocating, and smiled, "Okay,	 Baby picked up, and when I returned to Rome, you can do it, but I really want Mommy, Mommy, you do nâ€™t hurt me too much, despise you. "	 "You didn't get anything hurt?" "No, I'm fine, there is nothing at all, don't worry." Ning Ning said, "Mommy, the plane is about to land, say it for a while." "Okay."	 The milk bag closed the communication device. Cheng Anya drank hot water and warm her body. Ye San Shao looked at it with a few words with his son. As a result, he hung up without talking. He was very dissatisfied.	 Anya. Miss Cheng calmly ignored him, and the Black Eagle laughed, "San Shao, the plane is fast, and you can see the young master in a while." Ye San Shao felt that he was ignored and completely twisted Miss Cheng.	 "Small things without conscience." "Xiaobu." Cheng Anya smiled and scolded him, gave him the hot water, Ye San Shao co -authored Miss Cheng's cup and drank the rest of the hot water. At this time	 The body is even more wonderful.	 The plane landed soon, all landing in the castle, Chu Li, Ye Wei, eleven and others were there. At first sight, Ye San Shao and Cheng Anya were safe, and everyone was relieved.	 "Three Brother, Sanji, it's really embarrassed ..." Ye Wei laughed and trembled. "Three brothers, I should take a picture of it."	 Eleven and small milk bags are fine, he finally reassured.	 How can I happen to happen again after spending so hard? The little milk bag wanted to hold Cheng Anya happily, but she was strictly ordered by her. The little milk bag remembered that his mother had a virus on his mother. The Black Eagle had already said, and then he watched his father's mother holding it.	 Together, my heart sank slightly.	 "Daddy, Mummy, you all ... Bai Ye, you can help them see it." The first reaction of the little milk bag was to find Bai Ye. He was a genius doctor and had no illness that he could not cure.	 "I know, you know, don't worry." Bai Ye smiled.	 "Virus?" A blonde blue -eyed handsome guy blinked, "Xiaobai, isn't this your strength?" Xiaobai?	 Bai Ye's wrist twisted, smiling and gentle, "Jason, shout a little white to try?" "... Fortunately, what happened to Lao Tzu calling you Xiaobai? Originally Xiaobai, you also called Black Jack Xiao Xiao,	 iron." Jason, known as a fire dragon, scratched the fire on the spot, like the Golden Lion King, but he was so handsome.	 Especially the pair of blue eyes, as dazzling as sapphire.	 Initially, there is a shudder, as if the volcano erupted, there is a very exposed and domineering domineering.	 Black Jack on the side is a young man in his twenties. He is very delicate. He is a Chinese -English mixed -race. The facial features have the mystery of Orientals and the depth of Westerners. There are gray and blue eyes.	 It looks like an illusion of affection, but if you look closely, you will find that he is extremely sharp and has a deep and restrained restraint.	 The two major leaders of the first terrorist organization are not very old and have a very different personality, but the aura is very strong. One person has a kind of momentum of the monarch, let alone the three giants are here.	 This row looks very visual.	 "Jason, you really owe it." Eleven hummed, "What's the bad name, called Xiaobai, Xiaobai, beat him." Ye Wei glanced at them and shook his head, "Three Brothers, Three Aunt	 Don't care about them, you still take a hot bath and check again in a while, so as not to get sick. "She recruited the maid with Ye Chen and Cheng Anya to wash down. Although the small milk bag wanted to follow, he still stayed here.	 Bai Ye was about to be beaten, and the little milk bag quickly pulled his sleeve. "Bai Ye, can you have a way to save my father's mother?" The child's eyes were bright, such as two black grapes inlaid on Bai Nen's face, full of expectations, as if Bai Ye shook his head, the light in his eyes, his eyes	 It will be dim.	 Jason picked up a small milk bag and hugged it in his arms. "Baby, you can rest assured, Xiaobai dead can save, let alone live people, you are worried about a fart, come and come to me.	 The protective party's protection. "" Who just questioned Bai Ye's medical skills? "Black Jack doubted this, Jason passed, and he flashed agile.	 The little milk bag was held by the big tall, and the abnormally tangled, kicked Jason, "Let me down." "Lao Tzu also wants such a son, Ning Ning, come as my son?	 . "Jason's blue eyes burst into surging light, living like a small milk bag is a piece of fat.	 Everyone, "..." Bai Ye said with a smile, "Jason, you let your mother teach in Chinese, don't always say that the chief will not use words, and you can't go anywhere."	 ? " Jason was dissatisfied with someone connecting him with the chief.	 The little milk bag struggled, Jason put him down, and the little milk bag asked: "Bai Ye ..." "Ning Ning, wait for me to check them to be determined, don't worry first." Bai Ye said, rubbing the little milk	 The head of the bag, "I guarantee that I will do my best." The little milk bag just lost promises, and when the life and death of both parents could not guarantee, no matter how calm, he was disturbed. He could no longer lose them. Bai Ye understood that he was mentally mentally mentally mentally mentallyaring.	 "Don't worry too much." Bai Ye said.	 Ye Wei said, "It is done, to Bai Ye, there is no problem in this world that it cannot be solved. Since Louis can develop viruses, there must be a antidote.	 With a smile, "Agree." "Xiaobai, do you have a signboard?" Jason was deeply confused, and he never knew what signboard he had.	 Eleven wants to punch him in the past. "Speaking of which, why didn't the two of you caught Louis back?" Black Jack asked, "This guy died early, we were at ease early." "Lao Tzu has long wanted to destroy him. This time, the Mandarin Party was provoked all over the place.	 The guy's headquarters is bombarded and what kind of children are in the mood, it is really faint. "" Louis is not anxious. "The small milk bag slowly said, and a dangerous arc on his face, the dark eyes were clean, the dark eyes were clean.	 It is the light of calculations. "It is the one to win the highest level of victory without fighting. It is the same thing that he and us have a private hatred, but the battle between the black hand and the terrorist organization is another thing.	 A lot of financial resources. After this time, his status in the black hand party is crumbling. I have always doubted that the black hand party still has a force hidden in the place where we cannot see, otherwise, it is impossible for them to be such a self -destruction operation.	 It will not stop. In this case, we let Louis bring us the way, get out of this power, and annihilate it in one fell swoop. "Cursive ... This is the consistent idea of everyone.	 Although he knows that he has always been dark and insidious, because he is too young, everyone will always be doting, and with a pink and tender appearance, people will always ignore his essence.	 "Belly!" Jason raised his thumbs. He has always been actions. No other people think so much, but most of the time, he will listen to Black Jack and Chu Li's plan.	 He has always obeyed the plan of the small milk bag.	 After a full -scale action, there is a pair of powerful think tanks, which is terrible.	 "I agree with this method of Ning Ning." Chu Li said, he and Bai Ye have always agreed with his thoughts. "Once and for all, some people don't know that people do not know the heights of the sky, and always come to provoke."	 . "Black Jack laughed," But this time, it is indeed a lesson to give the Mafia a little lesson, so that he would have to detour when we saw us in 50 years. "Bai Ye nodded, and he had no opinion. What he did first was to solve	 Ye San Shao and the viruses on Cheng Anya are closely closed, and the rest are given to Chu Li.	 Ye Wei and Eleven looked at each other, is the other power?	 A face of the same face floating in their hearts, is it Mo Yan and Mo Yan?	 In the Malfe Party, only they can have enough appeal and mysterious. Except for them, they can't think of anyone else, and they can have such courage.	 Listen to him. Everyone moved to the living room, and the little milk bag went to Cheng Anya. She just took a bath and drank a cup of hot tea again.	 Finger.	 "Mommy ..." Little milk bag pushed in, and approached with a smile.	 Cheng Anya turned back, narrowed his eyes, and praised, "Baby, you really have a fan." This costume, Zhenya has a momentum, where there is a little child's taste, the whole is a dangerous person.	 "Thank you Mommy for praise." "Don't approach, sit away, I'm afraid that I can't help but beat you." Cheng Anya pointed at the sofa opposite, "Sit and go." Little milk bag stared at Cheng Anya resentfully	 A glance, "Mommy, you have abandoned me." "Positive solution." Cheng Anya laughed and glanced at the small milk. She always felt that this child was different. Although it seemed that it was no different from the past, the mother knew the child the most.	 Okay, she can feel somewhat.	 "Mummy, why do you think of me like this? Do you think the baby is handsome?" The milk bag blocked naughtyly, looking very cute.	 Cheng Anya smiled at him with a smile, "You have learned eight or nine points in your narcissistic kung fu. For a while, you are okay, tell Mommy the truth? Is it bullied?" Little milk bag shook his head,	 "No." "Non -nonsense, Louis showed me a photo, and was obviously beaten with blood." Cheng Anya obviously didn't believe it, gritted his teeth, "He was tens of thousands of swords, I don't hate it." I remembered that I had encountered encounter	 Everything, Cheng Anya hated Ji Louis.	 The bright face was covered with a layer of condensation. When she thought of the little milk bag, she had a bad premonition.	 "Mommy, I'm really okay, most of them are he's synthesis." Little milk bag smiled elegantly, lifted his sleeves, and revealed a white tender arm. "Look, there is no scar."	 Discover.	 And the whip injuries he had suffered were promised to stay. Since it was promised, he didn't think he was bullied, but he missed the pain he had been beaten by her.	 If Nono can live, he is willing to be stunned in this life.	 "Ning Ning, are you really okay?" Cheng Anya condensed, and did not miss the pain in his son's eyes.	 Little milk nodded, "I'm really okay, Mommy, you and Daddy, Uncle Black Eagle said that you have a virus, how can Daddy be stained?" Cheng Anya remembered Ye San Shao, who was full of sperm worm,	 The cheeks were red again. She didn't even have the desire and hope. "Don't mention it, jumping over the plane once in the desert, and jumping again at sea. How could it not be touched?"	 There is no doubt about him.	 "Mommy, there will be no matter, white night medicine is so clever, there must be a way to save you."
