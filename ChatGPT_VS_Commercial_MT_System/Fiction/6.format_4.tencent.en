The situation was one-sided. Both sides opened fire with all their might, and the entire ocean was filled with smoke. White Night's high-speed magnetic wave scanning gun opened fire again, and another plane was destroyed by him. This gun was really useful, and he was addicted to it. Little Lil Bun commanded calmly. The air force of the No. 1 terrorist organization formed an indestructible offensive and defensive team and began to launch the final round of fierce attacks. When Nicola saw that the situation was not good, he did not care about his status and raised his voice. " Master, retreat.If we continue fighting like this, we will all be wiped out. " Louis clenched his fists tightly. His face was dark and his entire body was filled with hostility. How could he not see the current situation clearly? But he was very unwilling to be pushed back like this. He was clearly close, but he could still capture them. It was a waste of time. It was really hateful. The man's emerald green eyes flashed with killing intent, and then it disappeared into his silent and melancholy eyes. He nodded at Nicola." Baby, they're going to retreat. Are you going to pursue them? " White Night chuckled. He had a special liking for this magnetic wave scanning gun. Holding it was like holding a child. The corners of his lips curled up into an indifferent and dangerous smile. The little one also smiled elegantly and ordered the attack to stop. His big black eyes were calm as he slowly said, "" If we don't pursue him and let him die like this, it would be a pity. The game of cat and mouse has just begun. " This game had already turned the tables. Louis, he should never have offended him. He had to find someone to bury Nuonuo's death. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to swallow his anger. Louis had the final say when the game started, but…The little one smiled coldly. He was extremely aggressive. He had the final say when it ended. Bai Ye smiled and waved his sleeves. " Alright, we won't pursue him. We have the capital to play with him. Maybe they won't even be able to do anything."Chu Li, it's over. We don't need any more support. We'll go back immediately." White Night called Chu Li and ordered his men to turn around and return to Rome. Black Hawk and the others spent a lot of effort to drag Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya up. They all knew that Cheng Anya had the virus and had already taken protective measures. Third Young Master Ye also warned them that he had the virus.Black Eagle and the others were even more careful as Third Young Master Ye lay down, panting like an ox. He couldn't help but kick Miss Cheng. " Little Anya, you have to lose weight. You're so heavy. " His entire shoulder was a little numb. Because he had been swimming in the sea for a long time, he had consumed a lot of physical energy. It was really tiring to hang Cheng Anya and float like this. Almost didn't catch her thrown into the sea, recall that picture he still feel a little hair scared. Black eagle and others are because they are safe and cheering, hand towel hand towel, pour hot water pour hot water, all busy, there are people take the opportunity to tease leaves three little how to live these days. The plane is very lively, men together, without a heroic spirit. Cheng Anya took the towel handed over by the black eagle to wipe his hair, and wrapped his cold body with blankets,Her ears automatically blocked his words and she was finally safe. She sneezed and could not help but wrap her body tighter. Black Hawk laughed and said,"Three little, madam is a bit thinner you want to dislike her ribs.""I dislike now." Leaf three little also rise, dry the seawater on the body,"is because ribs just so heavy." Cheng Anya continues to carry forward the virtue that silence is gold, black eagle found two sets of clothes to change for them, because it is a man's clothes, wear on Cheng Miss body is very funny, she simply wrapped herself with a blanket. Just changed clothes, black eagle told her, rather rather want to talk to her. Cheng Anya excitedly grabbed the microphone,"Baby, it's mommy." "Hi, mommy, want to baby?" Little milk bag sitting on the sofa, full of smiles and Cheng Anya chat, long time did not hear her mommy's voice, strange miss."Not at all." Cheng Anya cold humph, revealing a fierce tone,"you are too vegetables, so late to find mommy, the fight." Ning Ning thought of promise, heart a stifle, turn to smile,"good, baby take a fight, wait back to Rome, you love how to play can, but I miss mommy, mommy you also too don't love me,"Despise you.""Anti-contempt." Cheng Anya laughed, worried to ask,"You didn't get any injury?""No, I'm fine, nothing, you don't worry." Ning Ning smiled and said,"Mommy, the plane is about to land, say in a while.""Good." Small milk bag off the communicator, Cheng Anya drink hot water warm body, leaves three little originally eagerly looking at can and son chat two words, the result didn't chat to hang up, he was very dissatisfied, eyes accused to see Cheng Anya. Miss Cheng ignored him calmly. Black Hawk smiled and said, " Third Young Master, the plane is about to land. We'll be able to see the young master in a while. " Third Young Master Ye felt that he had been completely ignored and could not help but pinch Miss Cheng. " You heartless little thing. "Chu Li, Ye Wei, 11 and others are in, a see leaves three little and Cheng Anya safety, everyone breathed a sigh of relief."Three elder brother, three sister-in-law, can be really embarrassed ah ......" Ye Wei smiled flower branch disorderly tremble,"three elder brother, I should take a picture to make a souvenir.""Stinky girl." Leaves three little scold with a smile, Wei Wei 11 and small milk bag are all right, he finally also at ease. Spent so much effort, how can again accident? The little one wanted to hug Cheng Anya cheerfully, but was stopped by her strict orders. The little one then remembered that his mommy had a virus, and Black Hawk had already said that. Then he looked at his daddy and mommy holding hands together, and his heart sank slightly." Virus? " A handsome man with blond hair and blue eyes blinked. " Little White, this isn't your forte, right? " Little White? White Night twisted his wrist and smiled gracefully and gently. " Jason, try calling me Little White again? " Jason, who was known as the Fire-breathing Dragon, was enraged on the spot. He looked like a golden-haired lion king, but he was also handsome enough to make people and gods angry. Especially his pair of sky-blue eyes, which were as dazzling as sapphires. When he was angry, there was a kind of arrogance that made people tremble, like a volcanic eruption, and there was a kind of domineering aura that was very exposed. Black Jack was a young man in his twenties. He had a very delicate appearance. He was a Chinese-English mixed-blood. His facial features were mysterious from the East, but also deep from the West. He had a pair of gray-blue eyes.He always looked hazy, giving people the illusion of deep affection. However, if you looked closely, you would find that he was extremely sensitive and had a hidden introversion. The two leaders of the first terrorist organization were both young and had different personalities, but their auras were very strong. One person had the aura of a ruler, not to mention the three giants were here. This row looked very visual.Beat him."Ye Wei looked at them and shook his head," Three elder brother, three sister-in-law, ignore them, you still soak a hot bath, check again in a while, lest fall ill."She called for the maid to take Ye Chen and Cheng Anya to wash, although the little milk bag wanted to follow, but he still stayed here, white night pretended to beat people, the little milk bag hurriedly pulled his sleeves. " Bai Ye, can you save my daddy and mommy? " The child's eyes were very bright, like two black grapes inlaid on his fair and tender face. They were full of expectation, as if the light in his eyes would dim once Bai Ye shook his head. Jason grabbed the little one and hugged him in his arms, full of heroism. " Baby, don't worry. Xiao Bai can save a dead person, let alone a living person. What are you worried about? ""Who was the one who questioned White Night's medical skills?" Black Jack expressed his doubts. Jason's palm went over, but he quickly dodged it. The little one was hugged by the tall man, and he was unusually conflicted. He kicked Jason and said,"Put me down."" ... " Bai Ye smiled and said, " Jason, let your mother teach you Chinese. Don't keep saying that the officer doesn't know how to use words. You're not much better. I'm not on the same level as the officer, okay? " Jason was very dissatisfied with someone associating him with the officer. As the saying goes, officials and bandits are not one family. This is a matter of principle. The little one struggled for a while. Jason put him down. The little one asked," Bai Ye…" " Ningning, wait for me to examine them before I can confirm. Don't worry, " Bai Ye said and rubbed the little one's head. " I promise I'll do my best. " The little one had just lost his promise. His parents 'life and death could not be guaranteed. No matter how calm he was, he would feel uneasy. Bai Ye understood his current mentality. " Don't worry too much, " Bai Ye said. Ye Wei said, " It's done. Leave it to Bai Ye. There's no problem in this world that can't be solved.Since Louis was able to develop the virus, there must be an antidote. It's impossible for there to be no cure. If Bai Ye can't cure it, we'll take away his brand."Chu Li smiled." Agreed." "Speaking of which, why didn't the two of you catch Louis and come back?" Black Jack asked,"The sooner this guy dies, the sooner we'll be at ease. I've wanted to destroy him for a long time. Recently, the Mafia has been provoking all over the place. This guy's headquarters has been bombed, and he still has the mood to play with love. He's really stupid."It's one thing for him to have a personal vendetta against us, but it's another thing for us to have a war between the Mafia and terrorist organizations. It's going to take a lot of money and resources to wipe out the Mafia. After this, his position in the Mafia is on the verge of collapse. I've always suspected that there's another force in the Mafia that's hidden from us. Otherwise, they wouldn't have stopped Louis's suicidal actions. In that case, we'll let Louis lead the way for us and find out this force." He's cunning…This was the same thought everyone had. Although they knew that he had always been very scheming and sinister, because he was too young, everyone would inevitably spoil him. Coupled with his tender appearance, people would always overlook his true nature. Jason gave him a thumbs up. He had always been a man of action and did not think as much as the others. However, most of the time, he would listen to Black Jack and Chu Li's plans. He had always listened to the little one's plans. A man of action with a pair of powerful think tanks was a terrifying force."Ningning's words, when have you ever refuted them? They're in cahoots." Black Jack laughed."But this time, we should really teach the Mafia a lesson. Let him take a detour when he sees us in the next 50 years." Bai Ye nodded. He did not have any objections. His first priority was to be able to detoxify the virus on Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya. That was what was important. The rest was left to Chu Li." Another force? " A similar expression surfaced in their hearts. Was it Mo Ye and Mo Jue? In the mafia, only they had enough appeal and were mysterious. Other than them, they could not think of anyone else who could have such courage. They should be men who were above Louis. There was no reason for them to listen to him. Everyone moved to the living room, the little milk bag to find Cheng Anya, just as she had a bath, and drank a cup of hot tea, body warm, cheeks also rose two pink, is on the bed, thoughtfully looking at his fingers."Mommy ..." Little milk bag pushed the door and walked in, smiling and approaching. Cheng Anya came back to God, narrowed his eyes, praised,"Baby, you really have style." This dress, really Yaya have momentum, where there is a little child's taste.The whole is a dangerous person."Thank you mommy praise.""Don't go near, sit far, I'm afraid I can't help beating you." Cheng Anya pointed to the opposite sofa,"Sit there." The little milk bag resentfully glared at Cheng Anya,"Mommy, you despise me." Cheng Anya smiled and looked at the little milk bun. She always felt that there was something different about the child. Although it looked the same as in the past, the mother knew her child best. What changes were there in him? No matter how well he hid it, she could feel it."Your daddy 's narcissistic kung fu you actually learned 80 - 90%, this period of time, you are all right, tell mommy the truth? Were you bullied?" The little milk bag shook his head,"No""Nonsense, Louis showed me the picture, obviously was beaten a whole body is blood." Cheng Anya obviously did not believe, gnashed her teeth,"He was cut into pieces, I do not vent my hatred." Remembering everything that had happened to her, Cheng Anya hated Louis in her heart. Bright and beautiful face, covered with a layer of cold color,"Mommy, I 'm really fine. It' s most likely that he synthesized it." She had a bad feeling when she thought of what the little one had suffered in the past. The little milk packet smiled elegantly, rolled up his sleeves, revealing a fair and tender arm. " Look, there's no scar at all. " The bullet wound on his arm was almost healed, and soon, he was not afraid of being discovered by Cheng Anya. And the whip wounds he had suffered were all left behind by Promise. Since it was Promise's beating, he didn't feel bullied, but he missed the pain of being beaten by her. If Nono could live, he would rather be beaten by her like this for the rest of his life."You are really all right?" Cheng Anya eyebrows a condensation, did not miss the son eyes flash of pain. Little milk bag nodded,"I am really all right, mommy, something is you and daddy, black eagle uncle said you have a virus, daddy how also infected?" Cheng Anya thought of sperm filled brain leaves three little, cheeks are red, she even said desire, hope all have no,"Don't mention, in the desert when jumping a plane, in the sea and jump again," How could I not? " Miss Cheng said calmly. The little one did not suspect him. " Mommy, it'll be fine. Bai Ye's medical skills are so brilliant. He will definitely have a way to save you. "
