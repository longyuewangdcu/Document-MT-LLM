At this moment, the blue-silver golden light array appeared, and the fire light immediately dimmed and was guided downward. But that fireball was clearly not that easy to deal with. It fiercely inhaled upwards and actually snatched away a portion of the flames, then flew to one side with a "swoosh" and broke out of the range of the blue-silver golden light array. These changes were extremely fast and gave people a feeling of being unable to keep up. It's not easy to deal with this person. He must be taken down quickly, otherwise the enforcer will come. The fireball spews downwards, and the woman reappears, her eyes full of malice. "What are you doing?" In the time she was speaking, a golden light flickered at her feet, a gorgeous light pattern quietly appearing, and the woman's body immediately stiffened. Tang Wulin's blue-silver grass coiled upward, Ye Xinglan pointed the Star God Sword forward, pointed to the opponent's chest, Xie Xie had already quietly arrived behind her, and the Light Dragon Dagger was aimed at her neck. Everything is a routine! What is better than Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Chain for dealing with a single opponent? The absolute existence of the Starlight Lock Chain is a defiance of the heavens!  Just when everyone relaxed and thought they had defeated their opponent, an anomaly occurred! The Star God Sword had already arrived in front of them, and the sharp edge of the light dragon dagger was already at their neck. Under the threat of life, the woman's eyes suddenly lit up.  A clear phoenix cry echoed from her, and then, an unmatched powerful soul force burst out from within her. As if stimulated by something, red light circles shone under her clothes, they were halo, but they looked like they were inside her clothes, at the neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, knees, and other places. In the next moment that these red lights appeared, an extremely powerful soul force suddenly burst from the woman.  Much stronger than before, the soul force soared and turned into a huge ring of fire, and a layer of delicate golden patterns appeared on the floating fire gourd in the air.  The fire gourd, originally only a foot high, directly rose to two feet, becoming several times larger. The powerful fire element fluctuations suddenly erupted, and the severe impact forcibly knocked Tang Wulin and several others flying out, and the flames also burned their soul force like maggots.  The phoenix cry became even clearer, and the woman exuded a majestic aura. Then, dark red armor pieces rapidly appeared and covered her body. On her head is a phoenix helmet that covers her head and extends to both sides in dark red armor. The elegant streamline continues downward, curving and outlining the female's features. On the shoulders, the soft lines are enveloped and cover the entire arm.  Dark red flame patterns are all over the armor, and there is a golden-red phoenix pattern on the chest armor. The armor is not particularly magnificent, but when it covers her, the woman's breath has already risen several levels.  Tang Wulin spoke out, with a bitter smile already on his face.  Battle armor, yes, this is battle armor! From its complexity and aura fluctuations, it should be a one-word battle armor, and the halo that appears on the woman's body is the tool for storing the battle armor. The one-word battle armor cannot be integrated into the body of the battle armor master. But even so, this is a complete set of one-word battle armor! It means that the original five-ring cultivation of the woman was directly lifted to the seven-ring realm. Yanfeng was very angry at this time. She was in a particularly good mood and very happy today. She just went to the Sky Spirit Transmission Tower to register and officially become a one-word battle armor master. Battle armor masters are top-level existences that any organization is willing to cultivate, and just during the signing, the Sky Spirit Transmission Tower promised her a series of welfare policies. She is only 27 years old this year and is one of the youngest battle armor masters in Sky Spirit City with boundless future prospects. The Sky Spirit Transmission Tower has promised to assist her in providing a large amount of resources and help her to break through to a two-word battle armor master. Once she becomes a two-word battle armor master, she will have a place on the entire continent. But who would have thought that as soon as she left the Sky Spirit Transmission Tower, she was surrounded by a group of young guys not much older than her. And their abilities are quite strong, if they don't use the battle armor, they will really be hit. She doesn't know that Tang Wulin and the others have no malicious intentions. The Star God Sword and the Light Dragon Dagger made her feel the threat of death. At this time, Wu Zhangkong's voice sounded in the ears of the six people of Tang Wulin, "As long as you defeat her, this city is considered passed by you." Tang Wulin's mouth twitched, "Dance teacher, dance teacher, you have a dark side too! This is a complete state of the word-armored warrior, equivalent to the level of the seven-ring soul saint, can we win others? Before he had time to think more, Yan Feng had already started. The powerful soul force rose instantly, his right hand pointed towards Tang Wulin, and a fire line suddenly burst out from the fire gourd on top of his head, instantly reaching Tang Wulin's face. Now that it's come to this, I can only try my best, explanations are undoubtedly useless. Judging by the look in others' eyes, they know they have been angering. They have no advantage in this matter! Let's respond first and then talk. Tang Wulin took a deep breath, and the three purple soul rings on his body suddenly disappeared, a golden halo appeared, the halo shone, his right arm swelled, and golden dragon scales spread, at the same time, a dazzling star line quickly condenses on his right hand, and the hand guard of the armored warrior appeared. To deal with a real armored warrior, how can he not give it his all! "Armored warrior?" Yan Feng was also shocked when she saw the hand guard of the armored warrior on Tang Wulin's right hand. What appeared in her mind in an instant was just three impossible words! How old is he? Moreover, she clearly saw that Tang Wu Lin's armor emerged directly from his body. Could it be that he has two-character armor? Although it was only one armor piece, to have armor at this age is simply unimaginable. When she obtained her first armor piece, she was already 21 years old and was considered a genius. She has been working hard for these years and has finally become a true one-character armor master. But how old are these little guys in front of her? As Tang Wu Lin took action, the others quickly followed suit. Xu Li Zhi retreated earlier and it is needless to say that one by one, steamed buns flew out of his hand, light and delicate baozi, bloodthirsty red bean paste baozi, one per person. With his left hand on his back, Tang Wu Lin already caught two baozi, and without hesitation, stuffed them both into his mouth. A quick decision must be made. Even if it's only a one-character armor, after the complete set is collected, it has the ability to help the soul master quickly recover their soul power. "Fighting a persistent battle with others, they have no chance at all. With a forceful step on the ground with his left foot, making a loud "boom", Tang Wulin launches himself like a copper arrow. With his right arm in front of his body, his veins boiling with excitement, the golden dragon king's aura surges out. His eyes become completely golden, and the blood and qi fluctuations within his body are full of intense flavors. His right hand, golden dragon claws, blocks in front of his body, hard-slamming against the opponent's flame, and hard-pushing forward. As the team leader and a powerful soul master of the attack system, he cannot retreat even a bit now. Only by blocking the front can his partners have a chance. Under the stimulation of the blood-thirsty bean paste bun, his own soul power and blood and qi force instantly burst to the peak. His entire skin shows a light golden scale, especially on his right hand, right arm, and right chest. Is he a double-soul martial soul? Yan Feng was stunned. "Hmph!" She didn't dodge at all, and the fire gourd on top of her head suddenly rotated, turning the original fire line into a large flame spray, sweeping over the top of Tang Wulin's head, covering his partners and blocking the others. She wants to isolate Tang Wulin and first deal with this clearly obvious leader of the other side. The golden dragon's claws arrived in front of the opponent like lightning, and Yanying's right hand was also raised, clenching into a fist, hard slamming forward. Seeing that the two were about to collide, the dragon roar in Tang Wulin's body suddenly became excited, and a giant golden dragon head with a diameter of more than two feet appeared without warning, directly devouring Yanying's right arm. The golden dragon was shocking! After eating the red jade shrimp that day, Tang Wulin's own qi and blood did not break through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, but it also had a very big improvement, which made him more skilled in controlling the shocking golden dragon. Yanying was also shocked. She only felt a great force coming from the front, followed by a punch she blasted out. The flames were like being devoured, and the golden dragon claws were like big pliers, grabbing her right hand. The golden dragon's claws exerted force, and Yanying's one-word armor lit up all over, with all the flames on it coming to life, especially the fiery phoenix on her chest, which actually moved, turning into a phoenix fire shadow that directly slammed into Tang Wulin's chest.
