At this moment, the blue-silver-golden light array emerged, and the fiery light dimmed for a moment, being drawn and guided downward. However, the fire gourd was obviously not that easy to deal with. It suddenly exerted force to suck upward, taking away a part of the flame, and then "whooshed" to the side, breaking free from the range of the blue-silver-golden light array. These rapid changes were so fast that they were almost hard to catch with the naked eye. This person is tough to handle! They must be taken down quickly, or the enforcer will arrive. The fire gourd spewed downward, and the woman reappeared, her eyes filled with murderous intent, "What are you doing?" Just as she spoke, a golden light flashed beneath her feet, and a circle of magnificent light patterns quietly emerged, causing the woman's body to stiffen immediately. Tang Wulin's blue-silver grass entwined around her, and Ye Xinglan's Star God Sword pointed at the opponent's chest, while Xie Xie silently arrived behind her, his light dragon dagger held to her neck. It was all a set up! What could be better than Xu Xiaoyan's starlight chain for dealing with a single opponent? The absolute existence of the starlight chain was indeed a heaven-defying presence! Just as everyone breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had subdued their opponent, an unexpected change occurred! The Star God Sword had reached her front, and the sharp edge of the light dragon dagger behind her had reached her neck. Under the threat to her life, the woman's eyes suddenly lit up. A clear phoenix cry sounded from her body, followed by an unrivaled soul power that burst out from her in an instant. As if stimulated by something, under her clothes, circles of fiery red light shone brightly. They were halos that appeared to be inside her clothes, located at her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, knees, and other places. The moment these fiery red lights appeared, an incredibly powerful soul power suddenly erupted from the woman's body. It was many times stronger than before, with soul power soaring, transforming into a huge circle of fire that surged out. A layer of intricate golden patterns emerged on the fire gourd floating in the air, which had originally been only a foot high but now shot up to two feet, growing several times larger. The formidable fire elemental fluctuations burst out in an instant, forcefully knocking Tang Wulin and the others flying, and the flames burned their soul power like maggots gnawing on bones. The phoenix cry became even more resounding, and the woman exuded an imposing aura. Following that, pieces of dark red armor rapidly appeared, covering her entire body. A phoenix helmet covered her head, with the dark red armor extending to both sides, forming graceful lines that flowed down and curved, outlining the female's features. At the shoulders, gentle lines wrapped around and covered her entire arm. The dark red armor was adorned with flame patterns, and a golden-red phoenix design on the chest plate. The armor wasn't particularly extravagant, but with it covering her, the woman's aura had risen several levels. Tang Wulin blurted out, his face full of bitter smiles. Battle armor, yes, this was battle armor! Judging from its complexity and aura fluctuations, it should be a one-word battle armor, and the circles of light appearing on the woman were the tools for storing the armor. A one-word battle armor cannot be integrated into a battle armor master's body. Even so, this was a complete set of one-word battle armor! It meant that the woman, who originally had a five-ring cultivation base, had her strength directly elevated to the seven-ring realm. Yan Feng was very angry at this moment. She had been in a particularly good mood and very happy today. She had just gone to the Sky Spirit Messenger Tower to register, officially becoming a one-word battle armor master. Battle armor masters are top-tier existences that any organization would be willing to support. When she had just signed the contract, the Messenger Tower had agreed to a series of welfare policies for her. At 27 years old, she was one of the youngest battle armor masters in Sky Spirit City, with a boundless future ahead of her. The Messenger Tower had promised to provide her with a large amount of resources in the future to help her break through to the two-word battle armor master realm. Once she became a two-word battle armor master, she would be a true battle armor master in every sense of the word, with a place on the entire continent. Who could have expected that just after she had excitedly left the Messenger Tower, she would be besieged by this group of young people? Moreover, their abilities were quite strong; if she hadn't used her battle armor, she would have been in real trouble just now. She didn't know that Tang Wulin and the others had no malicious intent. The Star God Sword and the light dragon dagger made her feel the threat of death. At this moment, Wu Zhangkong's voice rang in the ears of Tang Wulin and the other five, "As long as you defeat her, you can consider this city conquered." Tang Wulin's mouth twitched a bit, "Teacher Wu, you have a dark side too! This is a complete one-word battle armor master, equivalent to a seven-ring Soul Saint level powerhouse. Can we really defeat her?" Before he had time to think more about it, Yan Feng had already taken action. Her powerful soul power surged instantly, and she pointed her right hand at Tang Wulin. The fire gourd above her head immediately spewed out a line of fire, reaching Tang Wulin's face in an instant. At this point, they could only give it a try, as explaining would undoubtedly be useless. Judging by her eyes, she was already infuriated. They were not in the right in this situation! They had to deal with it first. Tang Wulin took a deep breath, and his three purple soul rings suddenly disappeared, replaced by golden rings that emerged and bloomed. His right arm swelled, golden dragon scales spread, and at the same time, dazzling starlines quickly condensed in his right hand, revealing the battle armor gauntlet. To face a true battle armor master, how could he not give it his all? "Battle armor?" Yan Feng was also startled when she saw the battle armor on Tang Wulin's right hand. The words "not possible" instantly appeared in her mind! How old was he? Moreover, she clearly saw that Tang Wulin's battle armor emerged directly from his body. Could it be that he had two-word battle armor? Although it was only one piece of battle armor, having battle armor at this age was simply unimaginable. When she had her first piece of battle armor, she was already twenty-one years old, and she was considered a genius. After years of hard work and practice, she finally became a true one-word battle armor master. But how old were these youngsters in front of her? As Tang Wulin launched his attack, the others also sprang into action quickly. Xu Lizhi had already retreated far earlier, and without saying much, one bun after another flew out of his hands, including the nimble little steamed buns and the bloodthirsty red bean buns, one for each person. Tang Wulin's left hand was behind his back, having already received two buns and stuffed them into his mouth without hesitation. They had to fight quickly and decisively. Even if it was just one-word battle armor, once the full set was assembled, it had the ability to help soul masters recover their soul power quickly. In a battle of endurance, they had no chance at all. Stomping his left foot on the ground with a loud "boom," Tang Wulin shot up like a bronze arrow, his right arm blocking in front of him. The boiling blood in his body was stimulated, and the majestic aura of the Golden Dragon King surged forth. His eyes had turned completely golden, and the blood fluctuations bursting from his body were filled with an intense fierceness. With his right hand's golden dragon claw blocking in front of him, he braced himself against the opponent's flame and charged forward. As the team leader and a strong offensive soul master, he couldn't retreat even a little. Only by holding the front could his teammates have a chance. Under the stimulation of the bloodthirsty red bean buns, his soul power and blood energy exploded to their peak in an instant, and faint golden scales emerged all over his skin. The scales on his right hand, right arm, and right chest area were particularly dazzling. He had twin martial souls? Yan Feng was taken aback. "Humph!" She didn't dodge at all. The fire gourd above her head suddenly began to spin, and the original fire line turned into a large spray of flames that swept over Tang Wulin's head and covered his teammates, blocking the others. She wanted to isolate Tang Wulin and deal with this youngster, who was obviously the leader of the opposing side, first. The golden dragon claw reached Yan Feng's face like lightning, and she raised her right hand, clenching it into a fist to face the attack head-on. Just as the two were about to collide, the dragon chant within Tang Wulin's body suddenly became more intense, and an enormous golden dragon head with a diameter of over two feet appeared without warning, directly swallowing Yan Feng's right arm. This was the Golden Dragon Shock! After eating the Red Jade Shrimp that day, although Tang Wulin's own blood energy hadn't been able to break through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, it had greatly improved, allowing him to better control the Golden Dragon Shock. Yan Feng was also taken aback. She only felt a great force coming straight at her, and then the flames of her powerful punch seemed to be swallowed up. The golden dragon claw, like a large pincer, grabbed her right hand. As the golden dragon claw exerted its force, the one-word battle armor on Yan Feng's body lit up entirely. All the flame patterns on it seemed to come alive, especially the fire phoenix on her chest, which actually moved and transformed into a phoenix fire shadow, charging straight at Tang Wulin's chest.
