At this point, the blue and silver golden light array out, the fire light suddenly dimmed a little, was downward suction to guide. But the fire gourd is obviously not so easy to deal with, it fierce force upward a suction, actually took away part of the flame, and then "whoosh", shot to the side, out of the blue and silver gold array range. These changes are extremely fast, people some dazzling feeling. Not easy to deal with ah! This person. It must be taken down as soon as possible, or else the enforcers will be coming. The fire gourd spewed downward, the woman reappeared, her eyes containing fury, "What are you doing?" In the work of her speech, a flash of golden light beneath her feet, a circle of magnificent light patterns quietly emerged, the woman's body suddenly stiffened.  ... Everything is a set up! What could be better than Xu Xiaoyan's starlight chains against a single opponent? The absolute establishment of the starlight chains is a heaven defying existence! Just when the crowd was relieved and thought they had taken down their opponent, a sudden change occurred! The Star God sword had already reached in front of her, the sharpness of the Light Dragon Dagger behind her had also reached her neck, and with her life under threat, the woman's eyes suddenly lit up. A loud and clear phoenix sounded in her body, followed by a strong and unparalleled soul power instantly burst out from her body. As if stimulated by something, underneath her clothes, a circle of fire-red light shone, which was a halo, but looked like inside the clothes, respectively at the neck, both shoulders, both elbows, waist, knees, etc. The next instant these fire-red rays appeared, incomparably strong soul power suddenly burst out from the woman's body. The soul power rose up, turning into a huge ring of fire surging out, a layer of fine golden lines emerged on the fire gourd in the air, originally only a foot high fire gourd directly up to two feet, several turns larger. The strong fire element fluctuations instantly erupted, the violent impact will Tang Wulin a few people rushed out, and the flame is also like the maggots burning their soul power. The phoenix chirp became more and more loud and clear, the woman's body emitted a majestic aura, followed by a piece of dark red armor appeared quickly, covering the whole body. On the head is a certain phoenix helmet that envelops the head, the dark red armor extends to the sides, a graceful streamline that goes all the way down, arcing out to outline the female features, and at the shoulders, soft lines wrap around and cover the entire arm. The dark red flame pattern all over the armor, chest armor, there is a golden red phoenix pattern, armor is not particularly magnificent, but when this armor covered under, the woman's breath has been pulled up a few notches. Tang Wulin blurted out, while his face has been filled with a bitter smile. Douluo armor, yes, this is douluo armor! From its complexity and breath fluctuations, it should be a word doujia, appearing on the woman's body that ring of light is a tool to store doujia. The one-word doujia can't be integrated into the body of a doujia master yet. But even so, this is a complete set of one-word doujia! Meaning, the woman who originally had a fifth ring cultivation, her strength was directly plucked up to the seventh environment realm. Diem Feng was furious at this time, she had been in a particularly good mood today, particularly happy. Just now, when she went to the Heavenly Spirit Transmission Tower, she was registering, registering that she had officially become a one-word Doului master. A fighting armor master was a top-level existence that any organization would be willing to provide for, and just when she was signing up, the Transmigration Tower side had promised her a series of welfare policies, and she was only twenty-seven years old this year, one of the youngest fighting armor masters in Heavenly Spirit City, with a bright future ahead of her. She was only twenty-seven years old, and was one of the youngest Doului masters in Tianling City, with a bright future. The Tower had promised to assist her with a large amount of resources in the future, helping her to become a second-word Doului master. But who would have thought that she had just exultantly left the Spirit Transmission Tower when she was besieged by this group of youngsters who were not too old in front of her. And their ability is quite weak, if not use the doujia, just really to fall into the way. She did not know that Tang Wulin and the others did not have any malicious intent. The Star God Sword and Light Dragon Dagger made her feel the threat of death. At this moment, Mai Changkong's voice rang in Tang Wulin's six ears, "You just need to defeat her, and this city will count as you passing." The corner of Tang Wulin's mouth twitched a little, Miss Dance ah Miss Dance, you also have a dark side ah! This is a complete state of the word Doujia master, equivalent to the seventh ring soul saint level of power, we can win others? The first thing you need to do is to get your hands on it. The powerful soul power instantly rose, the right hand towards Tang Wulin a finger, above the head of the fire gourd immediately spewed out a line of fire, instantly arrived in front of Tang Wulin. The matter has come to this, can only spell to try, the explanation is undoubtedly useless. Look at people's eyes, you know that people have been angered. This thing they do not take advantage of ah! The first thing to do is to deal with it. Tang Wulin took a deep breath, the body three purple soul ring suddenly disappeared, the golden halo emerged, the halo bloomed, the right arm swelled, golden dragon scales spread, at the same time, a bright star line in his right hand quickly condensed, doujia hand armor emerged. How could he not go all out against a real fighting armor master! "Douluo armor?" Diem Feng was also startled when she saw the Douluo armor on Tang Wulin's right hand. The three words that instantly came to her mind were impossible! How old was he? Moreover, she clearly saw that Tang Wulin's doujia emerged directly from his body, could it be that he was a two-character doujia? Although it was only a piece of doujia, to have doujia at this age was simply unimaginable. When she first had her first piece of fighting armor, she was already twenty-one years old, which was still called a genius. These years have been diligent cultivation, finally became a real one-word doujia master. But how old are these little ones in front of you? Tang Wulin launched at the same time, the others also quickly acted. Xu Kasazhi retreated far before, without much ado, a bun shot out from his hands, light spirit small long buns, bloodthirsty bean paste buns, a hand. Tang Wulin left hand behind his back, has picked up the two buns, without hesitation are stuffed into the mouth. Must be a quick battle. Even if it's just a one-word doujia, after collecting the complete set, it has the ability to help soul masters recover their soul power quickly. The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you want to do. The left foot on the ground with force, issued a "boom" sound, Tang Wulin whole person like a copper arrow shot up, the right arm blocked in front of the body, the body bloodline boiling excitation, the Golden Dragon King breath surging and out, his eyes completely turned golden, the body blooming blood fluctuations filled with the taste of cool. The right hand golden dragon claw block in front of the body, hard to shake each other flame, hard top forward. As a captain, but also a strong attack system battle soul master, he must not back off half a point now, only he blocked the front, the partners will have a chance. Under the stimulation of bloodthirsty beanbag, his own soul power, qi and blood power instantly exploded to the peak, the skin of his whole body emerged light golden scales, right hand, right arm and right chest part, scales extra dazzling. He was a dual-life martial soul? Diem Feng froze. "Hmph!" She didn't dodge at all, and the fire gourd above her head suddenly spun up, the original line of fire turning into a large jet of flame that swept over the top of Tang Wulin's head and covered his partners, blocking the others. She wanted to isolate Tang Wulin and settle this little guy who was obviously the head of the other side first. The golden dragon claw arrived in front of the other side like lightning, and Diem Feng's right hand was raised, clenching his palm into a fist and shaking it head-on. The two sides were about to collide when the dragon roar inside Tang Wulin's body suddenly became agitated, a large golden dragon head with a diameter of over two feet appeared without warning and directly engulfed Diem Feng's right arm. The golden dragon startled the sky! After eating the red jade shrimp that day, Tang Wulin's own qi and blood had not been able to break through the Golden Dragon King's fourth seal, but it had also improved very greatly, allowing him to become even more proficient at controlling the Golden Dragon Surprise. Diem Feng was also startled, she only felt a strong force coming from the front, immediately after, the fist she blasted out, the flames seemed to be swallowed up, the Golden Dragon Claw was like a big pincer and grabbed her right hand. The golden dragon claw is firing, the whole of Diem Feng's one-word doujia lights up, all the flame patterns on it are like coming to life, especially the fire phoenix at the chest, it actually moved, turning into a phoenix fire shadow running straight into Tang Wulin's chest.
