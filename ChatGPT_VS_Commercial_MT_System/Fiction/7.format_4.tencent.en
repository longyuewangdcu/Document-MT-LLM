At this moment, when the Bluesilver Golden Light Formation appeared, the flames instantly dimmed and were sucked downwards. However, the Fire Gourd was clearly not that easy to deal with. It suddenly sucked upwards with force and actually snatched away a portion of the flames. Then, with a "whoosh", it flew to the side and rushed out of the range of the Bluesilver Golden Light Formation. These changes were extremely fast, making people feel a little dizzying. It was not easy to deal with! This person had to be captured as soon as possible, or the law enforcers would come. The Fire Gourd spat downwards.The woman appeared once again. Her eyes were filled with malice. " What are you guys doing? " Just as she was speaking, a golden light flashed beneath her feet. A circle of magnificent light patterns quietly appeared. The woman's body stiffened instantly. Tang Wulin's Bluesilver Grass took advantage of the situation and coiled around her. Ye Xinglan's Divine Star Sword pointed forward and pointed at her opponent's chest. Xie Xie had already silently arrived behind her while the Light Dragon Dagger was aimed at her neck. Everything was a routine! What could be better than Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Chain against a single opponent? The Starlight Chain's absolute establishment was a heaven-defying existence! Just as everyone heaved a sigh of relief and thought that they had taken down their opponent, a sudden change occurred! The Stargod Sword was already in front of them, and the Light Dragon Dagger on her back was already as sharp as her neck. Under the situation where her life was threatened, the woman's eyes suddenly lit up. A loud phoenix cry sounded from her body, and immediately after, an incomparably powerful soul power burst out from her body, as if she had been stimulated by something.Under her clothes, rings of fiery red light shone. They were rings of light, but they looked like they were inside her clothes. They were on her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, knees, and so on. The moment these fiery red lights appeared, incomparably powerful soul power suddenly exploded from the woman's body. It was unknown how many times stronger than before. Soul power rose and turned into a huge ring of fire. A layer of fine golden patterns appeared on the fire gourd in the air.The Fire Gourd, which was originally only one foot tall, rose to two feet in height. It grew several times larger. Powerful fire elemental fluctuations erupted in an instant. The violent impact sent Tang Wulin and the others flying. Moreover, the flames were burning their soul power like maggots in their bones. The phoenix cry became louder and louder. The woman exuded a majestic aura. Soon after, pieces of dark red armor appeared rapidly and covered her entire body. On her head was a certain phoenix helmet that enveloped her head.The dark-red armor extended to both sides. The graceful streamlined shape continued downward and extended in an arc, outlining the characteristics of a woman. Soft lines covered the shoulders and covered the entire arm. Dark-red flame patterns covered the entire armor. There was a golden-red phoenix pattern on the breastplate. The armor was not particularly beautiful, but the woman's aura had already risen several levels under the armor.Judging from its complexity and aura fluctuations, it should be one-word battle armor. The rings of light that appeared on the woman's body were tools for storing battle armor. One-word battle armor could not be integrated into a battle armor master's body yet. Even so, this was a complete set of one-word battle armor! It meant that the woman's strength had been elevated to seven-ringed realm from her five-ringed cultivation base. Yan Feng was furious at the moment. She was in a particularly good mood today. She had gone to the Heavenly Spirit Pagoda to register herself as a one-word battle armor master. A battle armor master was a top-notch existence that any organization was willing to support. When she signed the contract earlier,The Spirit Pagoda had promised her a series of welfare policies. She was only twenty-seven years old this year and was one of the youngest battle armor masters in Heavenly Spirit City. Her future was boundless. The Spirit Pagoda had already promised to provide her with a large amount of resources in the future to help her strive for a two-word battle armor master. Once she became a two-word battle armor master, she would be a true battle armor master in the true sense of the word. She would have a place in the entire continent.She was surrounded by a group of young fellows before her. Moreover, their abilities were not weak. If they did not use their battle armors, they would have fallen for the trap just now. She did not know that Tang Wulin and the others had no ill intentions. The Stargod Sword and Light Dragon Dagger made her feel the threat of death. At this moment, Wu Zhangkong's voice rang out in Tang Wulin's ears. " As long as you defeat her, you'll pass the test in this city. " The corners of Tang Wulin's mouth twitched.'Teacher Wu, oh Teacher Wu, you have a black-bellied side too! This is a one-word battle armor master in his complete form, equivalent to a seven-ringed Soul Sage. Can we win against him?' Yan Feng had already made her move before he could think too much. Her powerful soul power rose instantly. She pointed her right hand at Tang Wulin. The Fire Calabash above her head immediately shot out a line of fire and arrived in front of Tang Wulin in an instant. Since things had come to this, she could only give it a try.Tang Wulin took a deep breath. The three purple soul rings on his body suddenly disappeared. Golden soul rings appeared. The soul rings bloomed. His right arm expanded. Golden dragon scales extended. At the same time, dazzling star threads rapidly condensed on his right hand. A battle armor appeared." Battle armor? " Yan Feng was shocked when she saw the battle armor on Tang Wulin's right hand. The word 'impossible' instantly appeared in her mind! How old was he? Moreover, she could clearly see that Tang Wulin's battle armor had emerged directly from his body. Could it be that he was wearing two-word battle armor? Although it was only a piece of battle armor, it was simply unimaginable for him to possess battle armor at such a young age. She was already twenty-one years old when she possessed her first piece of battle armor. She was even considered a genius. She had been cultivating diligently all these years and had finally become a true one-word battle armor master. However, how old were these little fellows before her eyes?The others quickly moved as well. Xu Lizhi had already retreated far away. Needless to say, buns flew out of his hands one after another. Each of them had a Light Xiaolongbao and a Bloodthirsty Bean Paste Buns. Tang Wulin placed his left hand behind his back and received the two buns. He stuffed them into his mouth without hesitation. He had to finish the battle quickly. Even if it was just a one-word battle armor, it had the ability to help a soul master recover his soul power quickly after gathering a complete set. They did not stand a chance in a prolonged battle. Tang Wulin stomped his left foot on the ground with a loud bang. He shot up like a bronze arrow. His right arm blocked in front of him. The blood vessels in his body boiled and activated. The Golden Dragon King aura surged out. His eyes turned completely golden. The blood essence fluctuations that bloomed from his body were filled with a cruel flavor. His right Golden Dragon Claw blocked in front of him. He blocked the opponent's flames and blocked the charge. As the captain, he was also an assault-type soul master.He absolutely couldn't retreat even half an inch now. Only if he blocked the front would his comrades have a chance. Under the stimulation of the Bloodthirsty Bean Bun, his own soul power and blood essence power instantly exploded to the peak. Faint golden scales appeared on his entire body. The scales on his right hand, right arm, and right chest were especially dazzling. He had twin martial souls? Yan Feng was stunned.She flew over Tang Wulin's head and covered his comrades to block the others. She wanted to isolate Tang Wulin and deal with this little fellow who was obviously the leader of the other party first. The Golden Dragon Claw arrived in front of Yan Feng at lightning speed. Yan Feng raised her right hand as well. She clenched her palm into a fist and faced the attack head-on. Just as the two sides were about to collide, the dragon's roar in Tang Wulin's body suddenly became excited. A gigantic golden dragon head with a diameter of more than two feet appeared without warning and devoured Yan Feng's right arm. Golden Dragon Shocks the Heavens! After eating the Red Jade Shrimp that day, Tang Wulin's blood essence had improved tremendously even though it had not broken through the Golden Dragon King's fourth seal.Yan Feng was startled as well. She felt a strong force coming at her head. Immediately after, the flames in her punch seemed to have been swallowed. The golden dragon claw was like a pair of pincers as it grabbed her right hand. The golden dragon claw exerted its strength and Yan Feng's one-word battle armor lit up. All the fire patterns on it seemed to have come alive. The fire phoenix on her chest was especially moving.He transformed into a phoenix's fiery shadow and charged straight at Tang Wulin's chest.
