After carefully examining the house, they confirmed there were no major issues and made the basic decision. The rest of the matters will be discussed by Nanfeng with the real estate agent and the original owner. Today, Juanmao was in an excellent mood, he went out to play and have fun to his heart's content. After swimming in the sea for a circle and being called back to shore by Fangzhao, he even played in the sand for a while. When it was time to leave, the dog kept staring out the car window with reluctance. Nanfeng, seeing this, laughed and said, "Juanmao, don't worry, next time when we come back, you can stay directly in the house, and you can play as long as you want. You can swim in the sea every day and there are also little fish and shrimps to play with." Juanmao was happy, he lay down in the car and started to imagine his future happy life. What impression does Juanmao have of the ocean? The impression of a seafood buffet that is free of charge. His cheerful mood continued until he returned to the dormitory. After the three of them left, Fangzhao closed the dormitory door and said, "Juanmao, come here." Juanmao wagged his tail and went over. "Did you have fun today?" asked Fangzhao. "Woof!" "Was it fun over there?" Fangzhao asked again. Jaunmao jumped up and barked again, wagging his tail vigorously. "Speak." "Fun!" said Jaunmao. It can now switch languages fluently and its pronunciation is also smooth. "Hmm." Method nodded and then opened the learning machine. Roll hair: "... " With a twitch of its ear and shrinking its paws, it thought it retreated discreetly. Method ignored its retrenchment and opened the learning machine, showing it a new folder containing newly purchased e-books: "Marine Environmental Protection Law," "Young Environmental Protection Knowledge Collection," "Marine Wildlife Protection List," "Marine Environmental Management," "One Hundred Oceanic Knowledge That Must be Understood in the New Century." "The Sea, My Home" is all about ocean-related books, a total of 20 books. Not only electronic books, but also 20 sets of accompanying test questions. Rolled hair: "..." Its perked up ears drooped down. "I know you read fast, now it should be faster?" "After reading the 20 books in the folder and getting full marks on the corresponding 20 sets of test questions, you can go to the sea to play." "It's estimated to move there in no more than fifteen days," said Fangzhao. It's all rote knowledge, and it's not difficult for Rolled Hair to get full marks with its current memory and learning ability. When Rolled Hair goes to the sea, Fangzhao is not worried about its safety. On the contrary, he is worried that Rolled Hair will eat some endangered animals in the sea to extinction. Rollie's stomach is still unclear to Fazhi to this day. During the Bu Star Records program, Rollie stole food in the desert and in the ocean, but only because of Fazhi's warning, Rollie didn't really open his stomach to eat. After all, they didn't stay on Bu Star for a long time and had to consider other people on Bu Star, so Rollie couldn't eat too much. But in the future, when they move to the new home, Rollie will have the chance to go to the ocean every day without restrictions, which would be equivalent to species invasion, breaking the ecological balance of this sea area with the power of a dog. Fazhi needs to let Rollie know some things in advance, and it's not easy for ocean life to recover to this extent, so Rollie shouldn't destroy it. Don't think about going to the ocean if you don't get full marks, continue to keep the learning machine as your companion! This day, Nanfeng came to Fazhi because of the new housing renovation. When Nanfeng entered the dormitory door, he saw Rollie meditating with a drooping dog head and tears under its eyes. Nanfeng hesitated for a moment and turned his gaze away to find Fazhi and solve the current matter first. As for Rollie's side, this is normal, and Nanfeng has become very calm about it. After talking about the renovation, South Wind remembered something he saw today and said, "By the way, boss, do you know what happened online today?" "What happened?" Fang Zhaojin was writing a thesis today and had set his communication to not disturb him unless it was something important. There have been many topics about him online recently and many people have been looking for him, so Fang Zhaojin had to set his phone to do not disturb mode. "Do you know about Will's paintings?" asked South Wind. "Yes, I know, is it about Will's graduation works?" Fang Zhaojin had gone to see Will's graduation art exhibition and it was also an A+ high score. One of the paintings in the graduation work was a shaggy dog, named "The Dog from the Neighbor's House." The art exhibition has been over for two days, and since Fang Zhaojin has been writing a thesis in the dorm since this morning, he really didn't know what happened online. South Wind told Fang Zhaojin the information he learned. Originally, after Will's graduation painting exhibition ended, the academy put his paintings on display on the school website, causing heated discussions. Will successfully completed his study plan he set up last year - short-term goal of painting "My Neighbor," and the final goal of painting a dog of "My Neighbor." The short-term goal had already been completed. Will's "My Neighbor" caused a sensation online, and some netizens joked that Will painted the dog like an alien. This time, after "My Neighbor," "The Dog of the Neighbor's Home" once again topped the hot search list of the day. "The Dog of the Neighbor's Home" was Will's longest, most thoroughly researched and mentally challenging work during his study period, and also the one he was most satisfied with. This painting is similar in style to "My Neighbor," but looks more difficult to understand. "My Neighbor" can at least be recognized as a person, but "The Dog of the Neighbor's Home" cannot even be recognized as a dog. If it were not for the name of the painting, no one would think that the painting was a dog, or a small pet dog. The highly animated color rendering is mysterious and contains a grand atmosphere, seemingly too extraordinary and unconventional, but cannot be said where it is not appropriate. The more it is studied, the more a tremble will rise in one's heart. "Is that dog of Fangzhao so frightening?" A student of the Academy named Huangyi remembered the small curly dog he had encountered on campus after seeing this painting, and then searched for the dog of Fangzhao online to make sure he did not remember it wrong. On the other hand, after hearing Fangzhao's graduation concert and closely analyzing the person in Will's painting, Huangyi had a different feeling. "To be honest, this painting gives me a feeling that is almost the same as the song 'Î·' by Fang Zhen." "It's a bit beyond the understanding of ordinary people." Even if an amateur stands in front of this painting and quietly looks at it for a few seconds, even if they don't understand it, they will feel a little bit itchy in their hearts and their bodies can't help but shiver. On the internet, the discussions are even more intense. "I found that after further study, Wil's ideas are completely free and wild, and not something that I and others can understand." "What grudges! How could Fang Zhen's dog be painted like this?" "The previous friend must have not seen Wil's previous work, 'My Neighbor', and understand how Wil painted Fang Zhen." "Maybe Wil was bitten by a dog and has a psychological shadow towards dogs, otherwise it wouldn't be possible to paint it so scary!" "A cute little thing is painted into a monster!" "This is art!" "The artist's world is indeed not something that ordinary people like us can understand." "To be fair, I stared at the painting for five whole minutes, and still didn't get what he was trying to express, but it just feels so impressive, and there's this weird feeling in my heart." "This kind of painting at a deeper level requires careful study." "This painting won't sell well, right?" "It can also be used to ward off evil." "It's still worth investing in, keeping an eye on the painter Will, he's still young." After Will's painting was displayed on the school's online exhibition, some people came to him to buy it. In the end, a collector from Moozhou bought the painting "Neighbor's Dog" at a high price, far exceeding the estimated price of the Royal Art School. Some people think that the collector from Moozhou is too fanatic about curly hair, and when facing curly hair, people in Moozhou seem to always be insufficiently calm. Some people also believe that this is a pure speculation, not for Will as a person or for the dog Fangzhao, people in Moozhou's treatment of dog-related things is indeed inexplicable and seems to have lost their mind. In response to this, the Imperial Province Television Station's Art and Literature Channel sent someone to interview the collector who bought the painting at a high price. During the interview, the collector from Pasture Province stated, "Many people buy Will's paintings, they're investing in Will himself, not the paintings." "I'm different, I see the painting, and of course the dog in the painting." "I have a premonition that this painting will be worth a fortune in the future." When Little Bear saw the live interview, he said, "Pasture Province people really have a terrible instinct when it comes to dogs." "Humans are truly unique creatures." As a result, Will's "The Neighbor's Dog" and the curly-haired dog became popular and made headlines in Imperial Province current events news. After South Wind left, Fang Zhao flipped through the online news and told the curly-haired dog, "You better not go outside for the next few days, go back inside and read for five more minutes." "You only scored 62 on the morning test, read the section on protecting animals two more times!" "Are whales even edible?" "Coral can't be eaten either!"
