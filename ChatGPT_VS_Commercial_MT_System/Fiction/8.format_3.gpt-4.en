After carefully inspecting the house and making sure there were no major issues, they basically settled on it, and Nánfēng would take care of the remaining matters by talking to the real estate agent and the original owner. Juǎnmáo was in an extremely good mood today, enjoying himself thoroughly outdoors. After swimming in the sea and being called ashore by Fāng Zhào, he dug in the sand for quite a while, and when it was time to leave, his eyes were fixed on the car window, full of reluctance. Seeing this, Nánfēng laughed and said, "Don't worry, Juǎnmáo, next time we come, you can move in directly. You can play as long as you want, swim in the sea every day, and even have fun with small fish and shrimp!" Juǎnmáo was delighted and began to imagine his future happy life while lying in the car. What impression did Juǎnmáo have of the ocean? The impression of eating seafood buffets for free. His cheerful mood continued until they returned to the dormitory. After Nánfēng and the others left, Fāng Zhào closed the dormitory door and called, "Juǎnmáo, come here." Juǎnmáo happily trotted over, wagging his tail. "Did you have fun today?" Fāng Zhào asked. "Woof!" "Is it fun over there?" Fāng Zhào asked again. Juǎnmáo jumped up and barked again, wagging his tail with great enthusiasm. "Speak." "Fun!" Juǎnmáo said. He could now switch languages fluently, with standard pronunciation and smooth speech. "Mm-hmm," Fāng Zhào nodded, then turned on the study device. Juǎnmáo: "..." His ears twitched, and he retracted his paws, thinking he was stealthily taking a step back. Fāng Zhào ignored his retreat, opened the study device, and showed him a newly created folder containing recently purchased e-books: "Marine Environmental Protection Law," "Environmental Protection Knowledge Series for Adolescents," "List of Marine Wildlife Protection," "Marine Environmental Management," and "100 Marine Knowledge Everyone Must Know in the New Century." All twenty books were related to the ocean. In addition to the e-books, there were also twenty sets of accompanying test questions. Juǎnmáo: "..." His previously perked ears drooped. "You know you read fast, and now you should be even faster, right?" Fāng Zhào said. "After you finish reading the twenty books in the folder and score full marks on all twenty corresponding test sets, you can go play in the sea. We're expected to move there in no more than fifteen days." The content was mostly memorization-based knowledge, and given Juǎnmáo's current memory and learning abilities, scoring full marks would not be too difficult. Fāng Zhào was not worried about Juǎnmáo's safety in the sea; on the contrary, he was concerned that Juǎnmáo might eat some endangered marine animals to extinction. Fāng Zhào still had no clear idea how big Juǎnmáo's stomach was. During their time on Bùxīng, Juǎnmáo had secretly eaten in the desert and in the sea. However, due to Fāng Zhào's warnings, Juǎnmáo had not truly indulged himself. After all, their stay on Bùxīng was short, and with Fāng Zhào's supervision, as well as considering the other residents of Bùxīng, Juǎnmáo couldn't eat too much. But after moving to their new home, Juǎnmáo would have the opportunity to go to the sea every day. If left unregulated, it would be equivalent to an invasive species, disrupting the ecological balance of the marine area with the power of just one dog. Fāng Zhào needed to educate Juǎnmáo about some things in advance. Marine life had only just managed to recover to its current state, and they couldn't let Juǎnmáo destroy it. If he didn't score full marks on the tests, he could forget about going into the sea and would have to continue spending time with the study device! One day, Nánfēng came to Fāng Zhào to discuss the renovation of their new residence. Upon entering the dormitory, Nánfēng saw Juǎnmáo facing the wall, his head drooping and eyes tear-streaked. Pausing for a moment, Nánfēng shifted his gaze and went to find Fāng Zhào to deal with the matter at hand. As for Juǎnmáo, this was a normal situation, and Nánfēng had learned to treat it calmly. After discussing the renovation matters, Nánfēng remembered what he had seen today and said, "By the way, boss, do you know about the thing that happened online today?" "What happened?" Fāng Zhào had been writing a paper today and had set his communication device to "Do Not Disturb." There had been many topics about him online lately, and many people had been trying to contact him, so Fāng Zhào had to set his device to this mode. "Do you know about Wēi'ěr's painting?" Nánfēng asked. "Yes, is it about Wēi'ěr's graduation work?" Fāng Zhào had attended Wēi'ěr's graduation exhibition, which had received an A+ high score. One of the graduation pieces was a painting of Juǎnmáo titled "The Neighbor's Dog." The exhibition had ended two days ago, and since Fāng Zhào had been writing his paper in the dormitory since this morning, he really didn't know what had happened online. Nánfēng then shared the information he had learned with Fāng Zhào. It turned out that after Wēi'ěr's graduation exhibition ended, the academy had displayed his paintings on the school's website, sparking a heated discussion. Wēi'ěr had successfully completed his self-improvement plan set last year - the short-term goal was to paint Fāng Zhào, and the ultimate goal was to paint Fāng Zhào's dog. The short-term goal had been achieved long ago when Wēi'ěr's "My Neighbor" painting had stirred up heated discussions online, with netizens jokingly saying that Wēi'ěr had made Fāng Zhào look like an alien. This time, following "My Neighbor," "The Neighbor's Dog" once again topped the day's trending searches. "The Neighbor's Dog" was the piece that took Wēi'ěr the longest time, the most research, and the most effort during his self-improvement period. It was also the work he was most satisfied with. The painting's style was similar to "My Neighbor," but it looked even more difficult to understand. While "My Neighbor" at least resembled a person, "The Neighbor's Dog" didn't look like a dog at all. If it weren't for the painting's title, no one would think the subject was a dog, let alone a small pet dog. The painting was full of vibrant colors, mysterious yet grand, seemingly transcending the mundane, yet one couldn't pinpoint where it was inappropriate. The more one studied it, the more a sense of trembling would rise in their heart. "Is Fāng Zhào's dog really that terrifying?" A student from Huángyì recalled the small curly-haired dog they had encountered on campus after seeing the painting. Then, they searched the internet for Fāng Zhào's dog to make sure their memory was correct. Meanwhile, at Huángyì, those who had attended Fāng Zhào's graduation concert and closely analyzed Wēi'ěr's painting had a different perspective. "I must say, the feeling I get from this painting is quite similar to Fāng Zhào's piece 'η'." "It's somewhat beyond the average person's comprehension." Even if a layman were to stand in front of this painting and quietly observe it for a few seconds, even if they didn't understand it, they would feel a creepy sensation in their hearts and an uncontrollable shivering sensation in their bodies. The discussions online were even more intense. "After his self-improvement, Wēi'ěr seems to have completely let loose, with his thoughts freely roaming in a way that we cannot understand." "What grudge does he have to paint Fāng Zhào's dog like this?" "The friend who commented earlier must not have seen Wēi'ěr's previous painting, 'My Neighbor.' Take a look at how Wēi'ěr painted Fāng Zhào first." "Maybe Wēi'ěr was bitten by a dog and has a psychological trauma, otherwise, he wouldn't have painted it so terrifyingly!" "He turned a cute little dog into a monster!" "This is called art!" "The world of artists is indeed beyond the understanding of us ordinary people." "No exaggeration or criticism, I stared at the painting for a full five minutes and still couldn't grasp what he wanted to express, but I inexplicably felt that it was impressive, and there was a strange feeling in my heart." "This kind of painting belongs to a deeper level and requires careful study." "This painting won't be easy to sell, will it?" "It could be bought to ward off evil." "It's still worth investing in; I'm bullish on the painter Wēi'ěr. He's still young." In fact, after Wēi'ěr's painting was displayed on the school website, people started contacting him to buy the painting. In the end, a collector from Mù Zhōu bought "The Neighbor's Dog" at a high price, far exceeding the estimated value by Huáng Yì. Some people thought that this collector from Mù Zhōu was overly enthusiastic about Juǎn Máo, and when it came to Juǎn Máo, people from Mù Zhōu always seemed to be less calm. Others believed that it was purely hype, either for Wēi'ěr himself or for Fāng Zhào's dog. The way people from Mù Zhōu dealt with dog-related matters was indeed incomprehensible, as if they had lost their minds. In response to this, Huáng Zhōu Television Station's Calligraphy and Painting Channel specifically sent someone to interview the person who bought the painting at a high price. During the interview, the collector from Mù Zhōu said, "Many people buy Wēi'ěr's paintings and invest only in Wēi'ěr as a person, not in the paintings." "I'm different, I look at the paintings, and of course, also for the dog in the painting." "I have a feeling that this painting will be hyped to a sky-high price in the future." Seeing the live interview, Xiǎo Xióng commented, "People from Mù Zhōu really have a terrifying intuition about dogs." "Humans are indeed peculiar creatures." As a result, due to Wēi'ěr's painting "The Neighbor's Dog," Juǎn Máo also made it onto the trending topics and appeared in the headlines of Huáng Zhōu current affairs news. After Nán Fēng left, Fāng Zhào browsed the news online and told Juǎn Máo, "You shouldn't go out these days; after standing for five minutes, go back to reading." "You only scored 62 on the test this morning; read the animal protection section two more times!" "Can whales even be eaten?!" "You can't eat coral either!"
