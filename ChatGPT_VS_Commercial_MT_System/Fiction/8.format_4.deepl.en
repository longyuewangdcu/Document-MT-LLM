After a careful look at the house, to determine nothing major problems, it is basically set, the rest of the things South Wind will find the real estate agent and the original owner to talk. Curly is in a very good mood today, and went out to have fun enough. After swimming in the sea was called ashore by Fang Zuo, but also shaved the sand for a while to play, when leaving the dog eyes have been staring out of the car window, is full of reluctance. South wind saw the situation and laughed: "curly hair don't worry, the next time you come to live directly in, then you want to play for as long as you want to play for as long as you can go swimming in the sea every day, there are small fish and shrimp play oh ~" curly hair happy, lying in the car began to fantasize about the future happy life. What is Curly's impression of the ocean? The impression of eating seafood buffet for free. Its cheerful mood lasted until it returned to the dormitory for advanced students. After the three Nanfeng left, Fang Zhaoge closed the dormitory door, "Curly hair come here." Curly hair miso miso wagging tail and came over. "Did you have fun today?" Fang Zhaoge asked. "Woof!" "Wasn't it fun over there?" Fang Zhaoge asked again. Curly jumped up and gave another "woof", his tail wagging particularly vigorously. "Talk." "Fun!" Curly said. It is now able to switch languages proficiently, pronouncing standard and speaking smoothly. "Hmm." Fang Zhaoge nodded, then turned on the learning machine. Curly hair: "......" ears twitched, shrank its dog paws, and took a step backward thinking it was concealed. Fang Zhaoge ignored its retreat, opened the learning machine and showed it a newly created folder, inside the folder were the e-books he had just purchased - "Marine Environmental Protection Law", "Youth Environmental Protection Knowledge Series", "Marine Wildlife Protection List", "Marine Environmental Management", "One Hundred Marine Knowledge that People in the New Century Must Know The sea, my home" is all ocean-related books, a total of twenty books.

"The twenty books in the folder finished reading, the corresponding twenty sets of test questions all get a full score, then release you to play in the sea." "It is expected that there will be no more than fifteen days before moving over." Fang Zhaoge said. It's all rote knowledge, with Curly's memory and learning ability now, it's not difficult to get a full score. Curly hair to go to the sea, Fang Zao is not worried about its safety, on the contrary, he is worried about curly hair to the sea some endangered animals eat to extinction. How big is Curly's stomach, Fang Zhaoge is still unclear. During the recording of the program in the port star, Curly had stolen food in the desert and also in the sea, but because of Fang Zao's warning, Curly did not really open up his stomach to eat. After all, the stay in the port star is not long, and there is Fang Zao control, but also to take into account the port star other people, it stealing food can not eat too much. But after moving to a new home, Curly has the opportunity to go to the sea every day, without control, then it is equivalent to species invasion, to a dog's power to break the ecological balance of the sea. Fang Zhaoge has to let Curly understand some things in advance, the sea life is not easy to restore to the present degree, can not let Curly destroy.

During this period of time, there are a lot of topics about him online, and there are many people looking for him, so Fang Zhaoge can only set Do Not Disturb mode.

Will's final painting exhibition Fang Zhaoge went to see, also A + high marks, one of the final works of painting is curly hair, the name is "neighbor's dog". The exhibition has been over for two days, plus today from the morning Fang Zhaoge was in the dormitory writing papers, what happened online he really did not know. South wind will learn the information to Fang Zhaoge listen.

Will successfully completed the further study plan he made last year - a short-term goal to paint Fang Zhaoge and a final goal to paint Fang Zhaoge's dog. The short-term goal was completed long ago, and Will's pair of "My Neighbor" caused a hot debate on the Internet at first, and some netizens joked that Will had painted Fang Zhaoge like an alien. This time, after "My Neighbor", "Neighbor's Dog" was once again on the day's hot list. The Neighbor's Dog" is Will's longest, most painstaking and most satisfying work during his study period. This painting is similar to the previous "My Neighbor" style, but it looks more difficult to understand, "My Neighbor" can at least see the personal look, "Neighbor's Dog" can not see the dog look, if not see the name of the painting, no one would think that the painting is a dog, or a small pet dog. The extremely vibrant color rendering, mysterious and contains a great atmosphere, seems too transcendent, but can not say where inappropriate, the more research, the more the bottom of the heart will rise a sense of trembling. "Fang Zhaoge that dog, is it so scary?" After seeing this painting, a student of Royal Arts thought back to the little poodle he had met on campus, and then searched online for Fang Zhaoge's dog to make sure he remembered correctly. On the other hand, the royal art side, listened to Fang Zhaoge's final concert also close up analysis of Will this painting, is another feeling. "I really have to say that this painting gives me a feeling similar to the song "Î·" by Fang Zhaoge." "It's a bit beyond the comprehension of ordinary people." Even if a layman stands in front of this painting, quietly look at it for a few seconds, even if you can't read it, but the heart is hairy, the body can't help but shiver feeling. Online, the discussion is even more intense. "I found that after the further training of Will completely let fly, the idea of free spirited, not we can understand. ""What grudge! How dare you draw Fang Zhaoge's dog like this!" "The friend in front must not have seen Will's last one, "My Neighbor" to understand, first look at how Will drew Fang Zhaoge." "Maybe Will has been bitten by a dog and has a psychological shadow of the dog, otherwise it would not be possible to draw so scary!" "A good little cute to draw into a monster!" "This is called art!" "The artist's world is really not something I can understand." "Not to blow, I stared at the painting for a full five minutes, still can not appreciate what he wants to express, but somehow feel good awesome, there is a strange feeling in the heart." "This kind of painting belongs to the deeper level, need to study carefully." "This painting is not easy to sell, right?" "Buy back to ward off evil spirits can also be." "It's still worth investing, and I'm optimistic about Will as a painter, he's still young." In fact, after Will's painting was displayed on the school website, someone approached him to buy the painting. Finally a collector from Makushu bought the painting "The Neighbor's Dog" at a high price, the bid far exceeded Royal Art's estimated price. Some people thought that this collector from Makushu was overzealous about Curly, and that Makushu people always seem to be less than calm when dealing with Curly. Others thought it was pure hype, either for Will the man or for Fang Zhaoge the dog, and that the Makushu people were indeed incomprehensible in their treatment of the dog, as if they had lost their wits. In response, the painting and calligraphy channel of Huangzhou TV station sent someone to interview the person who bought the painting at a high price. During the interview, the Makushu collector said, "Many people who buy Will's paintings invest only in Will as a person, not in the paintings." "I'm different, I look at the painting, and of course for the dog in the painting." "I have a feeling that this painting will be speculated to a sky-high price in the future." Bear, who saw the interview live: "Makushu people really have a terrible intuition about dogs." "Humans are really peculiar creatures." So, because of Will this "neighbor's dog" curly hair also on the hot search, and appeared in the headlines of current affairs in the imperial continent. After the south wind left, Fang Zhaoge flipped through the online news and said to Curly, "These days you should not go out, and then stand for five minutes to go back to reading." "The morning test before the test 62, the piece of protection of animals and then read two more times!" "Whale that is able to eat!" "You can't eat the coral either!"
