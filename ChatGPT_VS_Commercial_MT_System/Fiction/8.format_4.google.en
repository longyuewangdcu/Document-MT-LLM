After looking at the house carefully, it was determined that there were no major problems, and it was basically determined. The remaining things Nanfeng would find real estate agencies and original owners.	 Rolling Mao was in a very good mood today, and went out to spread well enough.	 After swimming in the sea, after being called ashore by Fang Zhao, he also placed the sand for a while. When he left, the dog's eyes kept staring outside the window, full of reluctance.	 Nanfeng laughed when he saw this: "Don't worry about curly hair. You can live directly when you come next time. How long do you want to play?	 Rolling hair was happy, lying in the car and began to fantasize about the future happy life.	 What is the impression of curls to the ocean?	 Do not impress the seafood buffet.	 Its cheerful mood continued until returning to the dormitory.	 After the three of the Nanfeng left, Fang Zhao went to the door of the dormitory and "curls over." The curls were rushing to the tail. "Have you been happy today?" Fang Zhao asked.	 "Wang!" "Are you fun over there?" Fang Zhao asked again.	 The rolled hair jumped up again, and his tail was particularly vigorous.	 "Speak." "Fun!" Rolling.	 It is now able to switch the language proficiently, and the pronunciation standards are slippery. "Um." Fang Zhao nodded and turned on the learning machine.	 Rolling: "..." His ears trembled, shrinking the dog's paws, thinking that he took a step back.	 Fang Zhao ignored its retreat, turned on the learning machine, and showed it a new folder. The folder was the e -book just purchased- "Ocean Environmental Protection Law", "The Book of Environmental Protection of Environmental Protection", "Marine Wildlife Protection List	 "" Marine Environment Management "," One Hundred Ocean Knowledge in the New Century People must understand " "Sea, My Home" is all -related books, a total of 20 books.	 There are not only e -books, but also supporting test questions, twenty sets.	 Rolling: "..." <Ti's exciting ears and squeezed.	 "Knowing that you read the book fast, it should be faster now?"	 There are no more than fifteen days. "Fang Zhao said.	 It is all the knowledge of dead memories. It is not difficult to get full score with the memory and learning ability.	 Fang Zhao did not worry about its safety. On the contrary, he was worried that curls were eaten for some endangered animals in the sea. How big is the rolling stomach, Fang Zhao is still unclear now.	 During the Putca record, curls were stolen in the desert, and they also ate it in the sea. It was just because of Fang Zhao's warning that curls did not really appetite to eat.	 After all, it has not been stayed in the port star for a long time, and there are Fangzhao bouquets. It is also necessary to take care of others. It can't eat too much.	 But in the future, I moved to a new home. I have the opportunity to go to the sea every day.	 Fang Zhao had to let curls in advance to understand something, and the marine life managed to return to the present level, but it could not be destroyed by curls.	 If you do n’t get full, you want to enter the sea, and continue to accompany the learning machine!	 On this day, Nanfeng came to Fang Zhao because of the decoration of the new residence.	 As soon as I entered the door of the dormitory, Nanfeng saw the curls on the surface of the noodles, squatting with a dog head hanging down, and there was tears under the dog's eyes.	 The pause paused, Nanfeng looked away, went to Fang Zhao, and solved the matter at hand first.	 As for the curls, this is normal, and Nanfeng can already look at it calmly. After talking about the decoration, Nanfeng remembered what he saw today, and said, "By the right, do you know today?"	 Important things will not disturb him.	 During this time, there are many topics about him, and there are many people looking for him. Fang Zhao can only set up a different mode.	 "Do you know Will's paintings?" Nanfeng asked.	 "Know, is it about Will's graduation work?" Will's graduation art exhibition called to see it, and it was also a+high score. One of the paintings of the work of the work was curling, named "The Dog of the Neighbors".	 The exhibition has been in the past two days. In addition, I have written a dissertation in the dormitory since the morning since the morning. He really didn't know what happened on the Internet.	 Nanfeng tells Fang's information to Fang. It turned out that after the end of Wil's graduation exhibition, the college put his painting on the school website to display, causing heated discussions.	 Will successfully completed the dog's classmate that he set up last year -a short -term target painter, the dog's dog called the final target painter.	 The short -term goal has long been completed, and the "My Neighbors" in Will caused heated discussions on the Internet. Some netizens joked that Will was painted like an alien.	 This time, following "My Neighbors", "The Dog of the Neighbors" once again appeared on the hot search list on the same day.	 "The Dog of Neighbors" is the longest time for Wil to study, the longest research, the most effort, and the most satisfactory work of Will.	 This painting is similar to the previous style of "My Neighbors", but it seems more difficult to understand. "My Neighbors" can still see it.	 Seeing the name of the painting, nor can anyone think that the painting is a dog or a small pet dog in the painting.	 The very vibrant color rendering, mysterious and atmospheric, seems to be too extraordinary, but can't say anything improper. The more you study, the more you feel a tremor.	 "Fang Zhao, is that dog, is it so terrible?" A student of Huangyi thought back after seeing this painting. He recalled the small rolling dog that he had encountered on campus, and then search for a search on the Internet.	 Dog, confirmed that you remember correctly.	 On the side of Huangyi, after hearing the concert of Fang Zuming also analyzed the painting of Well's painting close range, it was another feeling. "What I really want to say, this painting feels the same as the" η "from Fang Zhao." "It's a bit more than ordinary people's understanding." Even if the layman stood in front of this painting, quietly	 Looking at the ground for a few seconds, even if I couldn't understand it, my heart couldn't help but tremble.	 The discussion online is even more intense.	 "I found that the Will after studying completely released, and my thoughts were free to gallop. I couldn't understand it." "What revenge and what grievances! I actually drew this dog from Fang Zhao!"	 Over the last one, "My Neighbors" understands, let's see how Will the painting call. "" Maybe Well was bitten by a dog, and there is a psychological shadow for dogs, otherwise it is impossible to draw	 So scary! "" A good little cute painted into a monster! "" This is art! " "The world of the artist is really not what I wait for mortals." "Don't blow it or not, I stare at the painting for five minutes, or I still can't realize what he wants to express, but I feel so inexplicable.	 The strange feeling of stocks. "" This kind of paintings that belong to a deeper level need to be studied carefully. "" Is this painting not easy to sell? "" You can buy it back to dispel evil. "	 He is still young. "In fact, after the display of Will's paintings, someone asked him to buy paintings.	 The last collector from Muzhou bought the painting of "The Dog of Neighbors' Houses", and the bid was far more than the estimated price of Huangyi.	 Some people think that the collector of Muzhou is too enthusiastic about curls. When facing curling, the Muzhou people always seem to be not calm enough.	 Some people think that this is a pure hype, either for Wil, or calling the dog for Fang. The Muzhou people are indeed incomprehensible to treat dogs, as if they have lost their wisdom. In this regard, Huangzhou TV Painting and Calligraphy Channel deliberately sent someone to interview the high -priced people who bought paintings.	 During the interview, Muzhou collector said: "Many people buy Will's paintings, and they invest in only Will, not painting." "I different, I look at the painting, of course, it is also a dog in the painting.	 "I have a hunch that this painting will be fired in the sky in the future." The bear who saw the live broadcast live: "The Muzhou people really have a terrible intuition for dogs." "Human beings are really strange creatures."	 As a result, because of Well's "Dog of Neighbors", the hair was also on the hot search and appeared in the news headlines of the current affairs of Huangzhou.	 After Nanfeng left, Fang Zhao turned over the news on the Internet, and rolled the Mao Dao: "Don't go out in these days, and stand back to read a book for another five minutes."	 Watch it twice! "" Can the whale be eaten! " "Coral can't be eaten either!"
