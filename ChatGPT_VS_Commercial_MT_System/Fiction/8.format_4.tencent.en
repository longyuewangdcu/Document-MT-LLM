After carefully inspecting the house and making sure that there were no major problems, it was basically settled. Nanfeng would find the real estate agent to discuss the remaining matters with the original owner. Curly Hair was in a good mood today and had enjoyed himself outside. After swimming around in the sea and being called ashore by Fang Zhao, he even dug the sand for a while to play. When he left, his dog eyes were fixed on the car window, full of reluctance. Seeing this, Nanfeng smiled and said, "" Don't worry, Curly Hair. The next time you come, you can stay there. When that time comes, you can play as long as you want. You can go swimming in the sea every day and play with the little fish and shrimps. " Curly Hair was happy. He lay in the car and began to fantasize about his happy life in the future. What was Curly Hair's impression of the ocean? The impression that eating a seafood buffet was free. His happy mood lasted until he returned to the advanced student dormitory. After Nanfeng and the other two left, Fang Zhao closed the dormitory door." Curly Hair, come here. " Curly Hair wagged his tail and moved closer. " Did you have fun today? " Fang Zhao asked. " Woof! " " Was it fun over there? " Fang Zhao asked again. Curly Hair jumped up and made another " woof " sound, wagging his tail especially vigorously. " Talk. " " Fun! " Curly Hair said. He was now proficient in switching languages, and his pronunciation was fluent. " Mm. " Fang Zhao nodded and turned on the learning console." ... " Fang Zhao's ears twitched. He retracted his paws and took a step back, thinking that he was hiding something. Fang Zhao ignored the dog's retreat and turned on the learning device. He showed it a newly created folder. Inside the folder were the e-books he had just purchased: " Marine Environmental Protection Law, " " Environmental Protection Knowledge Series for Teenagers, " " Marine Wildlife Protection Directory, " " Marine Environmental Management, " and " 100 Marine Knowledge That People Must Know in the New Century. " " The Sea, My Home " was all ocean-related books, a total of 20 books. Not only were there e-books, there were also 20 sets of test questions. Curly Hair said, "" ... " Curly Hair's excited ears drooped. " I know you read fast, so you should be even faster now? " " Finish reading the 20 books in the folder and get full marks for all 20 sets of test questions. Then I'll let you go to the sea to play. " " I estimate that there's no more than 15 days before you move there, " Fang Zhao said. It was all knowledge that was memorized by rote. With Curly Hair's current memory and learning ability, getting full marks wasn't too difficult. Fang Zhao wasn't worried about Curly Hair's safety when he went to the sea.Instead, he was worried that Curly Hair would eat certain endangered animals in the sea to extinction. Fang Zhao still didn't know exactly how big Curly Hair's stomach was. While recording on Planet Bu, Curly Hair had eaten in the desert and in the sea. However, because of Fang Zhao's warning, Curly Hair hadn't really opened his stomach to eat. After all, he hadn't stayed on Planet Bu for long. With Fang Zhao controlling him and taking care of the other people on Planet Bu, Curly Hair wouldn't be able to eat too much. However, after moving to a new home, Curly Hair would have the opportunity to go to the sea every day. If he didn't do so, it would be equivalent to a species invasion.Using the power of a single dog to break the ecological balance of this sea area. Fang Zhao had to let Curly Hair know some things in advance. The marine life had finally recovered to its current level, and he couldn't let Curly Hair destroy it. If he didn't get full marks, don't even think about entering the sea. Continue to be with the learning machine! That day, Nanfeng came to find Fang Zhao because of the renovation of his new residence. The moment he entered the dormitory, Nanfeng saw Curly Hair facing the wall, his head drooping listlessly as he squatted there. There were tears under his eyes. His footsteps paused, and Nanfeng looked away.As for Curly Hair, this was normal, and Nanfeng was already able to look at him calmly. After discussing the renovation, Nanfeng recalled what he had seen today and said, "" By the way, Boss, do you know about the online incident today? " " What's the matter? " Fang Zhao was writing his thesis today. He had set up his communication, so he wouldn't disturb him unless there was something important. There had been a lot of topics about him online recently, and there were many people looking for him. Fang Zhao could only set the Do Not Disturb mode. " Do you know about Will's paintings? " Nanfeng asked. " Yes, it's about Will's graduation work? " Fang Zhao had seen Will's graduation exhibition before, and it also received A+ marks.One of the graduation projects was Curly Hair's painting. It was called " The Neighbor's Dog. " The art exhibition had already passed two days ago, and since this morning, Fang Zhao had been writing his thesis in the dormitory. He really didn't know what was happening online. Nanfeng told Fang Zhao what he had learned. It turned out that after Will's graduation exhibition ended, the academy had put his paintings on display on the school website, causing heated discussion. Will had successfully completed the training plan he had set out last year--his short-term goal was to draw Fang Zhao, and his final goal was to draw Fang Zhao's dog. His short-term goal had long been completed. Will's painting of "My Neighbor" had caused heated discussion on the Internet, and some netizens joked that Will had drawn Fang Zhao like an alien. This time, after "My Neighbor,"" The Neighbor's Dog " was once again on the hot search list that day. " The Neighbor's Dog " was the work that Will spent the longest time, studied the longest, and put the most effort into during his studies. It was also the work that Will was most satisfied with. This painting was similar in style to the previous " My Neighbor ", but it looked more difficult to understand. At least, " My Neighbor " could still tell a person's appearance, but " The Neighbor's Dog " could not tell a dog's appearance. If not for the name of the painting, no one would have thought that the painting was a dog." Fang Zhao's dog, is he really that scary? " A HuangArt student recalled the little curly-haired dog he had encountered on campus after seeing the painting. He then searched for Fang Zhao's dog online to confirm that he had remembered correctly. As for HuangArt,Those who had listened to Fang Zhao's graduation concert and analyzed Will's painting up close had a different feeling. " If I really have to say it, the feeling this painting gives me is similar to Fang Zhao's " Î· ". It's a little beyond the scope of ordinary people's understanding. " Even if an outsider stood in front of this painting and quietly looked at it for a few seconds, even if he couldn't understand it, his heart would still feel numb and his body couldn't help but shiver. The discussion on the Internet was even more intense. " I realized that Will had completely let go after his advanced studies. His thoughts were free to run wild." What grudge? How could he paint Fang Zhao's dog like this? " " That friend from before must have never seen Will's previous painting. Let's learn more about 'My Neighbors'. Let's see how Will drew Fang Zhao first. " " Maybe Will was bitten by a dog and has a psychological trauma towards dogs. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to draw such a scary picture! " " A perfectly good little cutie turned into a monster! " " This is called art! " " The world of an artist is indeed not something that mortals like us can understand. " " It's neither bragging nor blackmailing. I stared at the painting for five minutes, but I still couldn't understand what he was trying to express. However, for some reason, I felt that it was so awesome. I still had a strange feeling in my heart. " " This kind of painting belongs to a deeper level and needs to be studied carefully. " " This painting isn't easy to sell, right? " " I can also buy it back to ward off evil spirits. " " It's still worth investing. I have a good opinion of Will as an artist." He's still young. " In fact, after Will's painting was displayed on the school website, someone approached him to buy the painting. Finally, a collector from Muzhou bought the painting " Neighbor's Dog " at a high price, far exceeding HuangArt's estimated price. Some people thought that this Muzhou collector was overly enthusiastic about Curly Hair. When facing Curly Hair, the people of Muzhou never seemed to be calm enough. Others thought that this was pure hype, either for Will or for Fang Zhao's dog.Muzhou people's treatment of dogs was indeed incomprehensible, as if they had lost their minds. In response, Huangzhou TV Station's Painting and Calligraphy Channel specially sent someone to interview the person who bought the painting at a high price." Many people buy Will's paintings and only invest in Will, not the painting. I'm different. I'm looking at the painting, and of course, for the dog in the painting. I have a feeling that this painting will be sold at an astronomical price in the future. "" The people of Muzhou really have a terrifying instinct for dogs. Humans are indeed strange creatures. " Hence, Curly Hair's " Neighbor's Dog " by Will also became a trending topic and appeared on the headlines of Huangzhou's current news." Don't go out for the next few days. Stand there for another five minutes and go back to reading. " " You only scored 62 in the morning test. Look at the animal protection section twice more! " " Is whale edible? " "You can't eat coral either!"
