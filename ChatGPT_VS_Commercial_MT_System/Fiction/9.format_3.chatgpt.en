"This is to bring you the experience of sensing the fluctuation of breath, it's really simple." The other magician beside him couldn't help but interjected with a smile. "Thanks then." Lin Sheng nodded. He needed to find the other fragments as soon as possible. Originally, he was going to obtain more purified soul energy by defeating more evil spirits from the government. But now that he has encountered this opportunity, the quickest way to get it into his hands is the way to go. Soon, the magician led Lin Sheng to stand in front of an evil spirit gate. The two reached out and gently touched the edge of the evil spirit gate at the same time, and closed their eyes. The magician quickly used his ability to construct a space foundation as the coordinates. Then, following the ritual fluctuation of the evil spirit gate, Lin Sheng's perception was also sent out with the ritual fluctuation. "A normal transmission ritual is a point-to-point directional transmission." "But when we explore other secret spaces, we transform this point-to-point into point-to-many," "This only requires a slight modification of the parameters on the transmission substrate." said the master wizard, leading Lin Sheng's consciousness while imparting related skills. "In this way, the evil gate will automatically transmit our consciousness to many possible spaces similar to the target space," he continued. "This is actually using energy to rely on luck. If luck is good, we can hit the secret space we want in one go. If luck is not good, we will have to waste energy and try a few more times." "It's really random enough," Lin Sheng said without words. As soon as his consciousness entered the evil gate, it was immediately wrapped up by the ritual fluctuations and sent out. At the same time, he felt like his consciousness had split into more than a dozen pieces, sensing more than a dozen completely different space atmospheres. "Generally, our consciousness is hard to maintain integrity during the transmission process, so we can only remember the spatial coordinates that our main consciousness touches as much as possible." "The coordinates of the memory require us to leave a simple marker..." The outside wizard is still explaining in a low voice, while guiding Lin Sheng, teaching him how to make a simple marker in order to determine the coordinate code. However, he never imagined that because the consciousness of the spiritual lock was too strong and stubborn, after being split, the more than ten pieces of consciousness that touched the space, he could all remember the coordinates. However, this is just one mind with more than ten uses. For Lin Sheng, who can use one mind with N, this is not much. He exercises the skill of one mind with dozens of uses every day. Every summoned object, he can control and observe through the split consciousness of the soul. So now, although he can't control many summoned objects at the same time and have them act independently, he only remembers the fluctuation of breath and sets the coordinates separately. Furthermore, his own soul is more resilient than the average person and has a longer existence time. This is still very easy. Ten minutes later, the consciousness was exhausted and dispersed. Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the wizard and a few others. "Locate the secret space of this coordinate for me." He immediately said one of the special secret space coordinates under the gaze of the wizard and others, who were dumbfounded. This special space, with the same origin as the Yin-to-Evil Wheel fragment in his arms, was exactly what Lin Sheng had perceived and located at the coordinate. "Did you succeed in one shot?" The sorcerer was a little bitter, it took him more than half a month to locate the coordinate and record it when he first perceived the spatial energy. "It's a very simple operation," "Start, establish the portal," "I want to go over." Lin Sheng ordered. "Yes," "Wait a moment, main body," The soul voice of Tiangong Xia stopped Lin Sheng's movement. "What?" He watched as the sorcerer and others began to command the evil spirits to move resources over here, while he walked to one side and waited. At the same time, he communicated with Tian Gong Xia through telepathy. "There's a situation here. It's different from what's on the Sahaja island. Something big has changed!" Tian Gong Xia's tone was slightly solemn. This was something Lin Sheng had never seen before. To know that even when he told Tian Gong Xia about the existence of the King of Night, he had never seen her so serious. This made him feel a sense of abnormal tension. "Is the moon shadow at a disadvantage?" Lin Sheng frowned and asked. "Or is there a new combat force joining?" "No, it's not a new combat force," Tian Gong Xia said solemnly. "And it's because Yimu has tricked everyone!" "??? What's going on?" "The Seven Locks Tower was summoned long ago, Yimu has tricked all the people in the three secret realms, he has already successfully summoned Farudo! Using himself as a sacrifice! And merged with it!" Lin Sheng was stunned for a moment. "As a sacrifice of oneself?" "...this crazy person!" "So, what the three secret realms are facing now is the monster that is the fusion of Yimu and Farudo..." Lin Sheng was speechless. "What should we do now?" Tiangong Xia said seriously. The combination of Farudo and Miyue is not as simple as one plus one equals two, but rather a result of three multiplied by ten. "Don't get excited." "For Miyue and Farudo, the biggest enemy is still the three secret realms and many other powerful forces." "And this world is not as simple as you think." Lin Sheng thought of the previous investigation and the information obtained. "The Great Star Pool, and those who hold the Holy artifact of fate, are not simple characters." "As long as he doesn't come to provoke us, we don't care how they develop." "I understand what you mean." "But it's best to be prepared early." Tian Gongxia reminded. "I once had that level of destructive power. It was during the period when I was manipulated by the Demon Sword." "So I'm very clear about what kind of results that level of power would cause." Lin Sheng remained silent. Of all his leaders, Tiangong Xia is the most special one. Because Tiangong Xia has been affected and controlled by a certain unique and powerful existence. At that time, even in memory recall, she still detected Lin Sheng's surveillance. Just a shadow imprint in a memory, she was able to find Lin Sheng who was spying on memories. Such power has already exceeded Lin Sheng's understanding. "I understand." Lin Sheng answered again. "I'll be prepared." "Don't worry." If worst comes to worst, he could activate the most powerful special state, summon all the leader's power and merge it into himself. Breaking the connection with Tiangu Xia, Lin Sheng quietly gazed at the newly built new devil gate. His thoughts returned to his original plan. "It's open. Your Highness," the wizard leader whispered. Lin Sheng gazed at the teleportation portal for a moment in silence. "Let the fairy king come. Also, Degaier!" Degaier's magic hand had already arrived nearby and waiting. Upon hearing the summons, he immediately walked in from the entrance. "Your Highness, following your orders." Lin Sheng nodded slightly. "I want to open multiple teleportation portals at the same time and explore multiple devil spaces." "You choose 100 big devils and divide them into different teams to explore individually." "Understood!" The magic hand of Déjiā'ěr was awe-inspiring, knowing that it was probably a turning point for the master. Otherwise, he would not suddenly move to explore on such a large scale with such urgency.
