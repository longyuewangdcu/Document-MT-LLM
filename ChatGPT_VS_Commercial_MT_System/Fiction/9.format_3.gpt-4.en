"This is to let you experience the fluctuations of energy, which is really simple," another sorcerer nearby couldn't help but laugh and interject. "Thank you," Lin Sheng nodded. He needed to find the other fragments as quickly as possible. Originally, he planned to deal with more evil spirits through the government and gain more pure soul power. However, now that he had encountered this opportunity, it was best to obtain it as quickly as possible. Soon, the sorcerer leader led Lin Sheng to the front of an evil spirit gate. The two of them reached out and gently touched the edge of the evil spirit gate, closing their eyes. The sorcerer leader quickly used his abilities to construct a spatial foundation as a coordinate anchor. Then, following the ritual fluctuations of the evil spirit gate, he took Lin Sheng's perception and consciousness along with him, and they were both launched by the ritual fluctuations. "The ordinary teleportation gate ceremony is point-to-point directional teleportation." "But when we usually explore other spatial secret realms, we change this point-to-point into point-to-multiple," the sorcerer leader said while guiding Lin Sheng's consciousness and teaching related techniques. "In this way, the evil spirit gate will spontaneously transmit our consciousness to multiple potential locations within similar target spaces." "In fact, this is just relying on energy and luck. If we're lucky, we can quickly find the spatial secret realm we want. If we're unlucky, we'll have to waste energy and try several times." "It's quite random indeed," Lin Sheng said speechlessly. As soon as his perception entered the evil spirit gate, it was immediately caught by the ritual fluctuations and launched outward. At the same time, it felt as if his consciousness had split, and his perception was divided into more than ten parts, perceiving more than ten completely different spatial atmospheres simultaneously. "Generally speaking, it is difficult for our consciousness to maintain integrity during the transmission process, so we can only try our best to remember the spatial coordinates that the main consciousness comes into contact with." "The memory of the coordinates requires us to leave a simple mark..." The sorcerer leader outside was explaining in a low voice, while guiding Lin Sheng and teaching him how to create a simple mark to determine the coordinate code. However, he had no idea that Lin Sheng's soul consciousness from the Spirit Lock was so powerful and resilient that after it was split, he could remember all the coordinates of the more than ten spaces his split consciousness came into contact with. It was just a matter of multitasking. For Lin Sheng, whose soul consciousness could multitask, this was not a big deal. He practiced the art of multitasking every day. He could control and observe each summon through his split soul consciousness. Although he couldn't control multiple summons independently at the same time, it was only a matter of remembering the fluctuations of energy and setting the coordinates separately. Moreover, his soul was inherently more resilient and had a longer existence than ordinary people, making this task quite easy. Ten minutes later, with his consciousness depleted and dispersed, Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the sorcerer leader and his companions. "Locate the spatial secret realm of this coordinate for me," he immediately said, revealing a special spatial secret realm coordinate under the stunned gaze of the sorcerer leader and the others. The spatial secret realm of this coordinate was precisely the special space that Lin Sheng had sensed, which had the same origin as the Yin-to-Evil Wheel fragment in his arms. "You succeeded on the first try?" The sorcerer leader felt a bit bitter in his heart. When he first sensed the spatial atmosphere and determined the coordinates, recording them took him more than half a month to succeed. "It's a simple operation," Lin Sheng said. "Let's begin. Set up the teleportation gate. I want to go there," he instructed. "Yes," the sorcerer leader replied. "Wait for the main body," the soul transmission of Tian Gongxia caused Lin Sheng to pause in his movements. "What's the matter?" As he watched the sorcerer leader and others begin to instruct the evil spirits to move materials and resources over, Lin Sheng walked to the side to wait while communicating with Tian Gongxia in his mind. "There's a situation here. There has been a major change compared to Bisha Island!" Tian Gongxia's tone was somewhat solemn. This was a sign Lin Sheng had never seen before. It should be noted that even when he informed Tian Gongxia of the existence of the Night King, he had never seen her so serious. This made him feel an unusual sense of tension. "Is Miyue at an absolute disadvantage?" Lin Sheng frowned and asked. "Or has new combat power joined?" "No, it's not new combat power," Tian Gongxia said solemnly. "Miyue has deceived everyone!" Tian Gongxia revealed. "What's going on?" Lin Sheng asked, puzzled. "The Seven Locks Tower was successfully summoned long ago. Miyue has deceived everyone from the three major secret realms. He has already successfully summoned Farudo, using himself as a sacrifice and merging with it!" Lin Sheng's consciousness paused for a moment. "Using himself as a sacrifice?" "â€¦This madman!" Lin Sheng exclaimed. "So now, what the three major secret realms are facing is a fusion monster composed of Miyue and Farudo..." Lin Sheng was at a loss for words. "What should we do now?" Tian Gongxia asked solemnly. The combination of Farudo and Miyue is not as simple as one plus one equals two; it's more like the result of three times ten. "Don't get agitated," Lin Sheng said. "For Miyue and Farudo, their biggest enemies are still the three major secret realms and other powerful forces." "Besides, this world is not as simple as you think." Lin Sheng recalled the information he had previously investigated. "The Great Star Pool and those who possess the Destiny Sacred Artifacts are not simple characters." "As long as they don't provoke us, we don't care about how they develop." "I understand what you mean," Tian Gongxia replied. "However, it's best to be prepared in advance," she reminded. "I once possessed such a level of destructive power during the period when I was manipulated by the Demon Sword." "So, I know very well what kind of consequences that level of power can lead to," Lin Sheng said quietly. Among all his commanders, Tian Gongxia was the most special one. She had once been influenced and controlled by a peculiarly powerful existence. At that time, she even discovered Lin Sheng's prying while retracing her memories. Just a trace of a memory imprint was enough to detect Lin Sheng's observation. Such power was beyond Lin Sheng's understanding. "I understand," Lin Sheng replied again. "I will be prepared." "Don't worry," he reassured. In the worst-case scenario, he would activate his most powerful special state, summon all the commanders' power, and integrate it into himself. Disconnecting from Tian Gongxia, Lin Sheng quietly stared at the newly constructed evil spirit gate, his thoughts returning to his original plan. "It's ready to open, Your Honor," the sorcerer leader whispered. Lin Sheng gazed at the teleportation gate, silent for a moment. "Let the Fairy King come over. Also, Dejagal!" Dejagal's demon hand had already been waiting nearby. Hearing the summons, he immediately walked in through the door. "Your Honor, I await your command," Dejagal said. Lin Sheng nodded. "I want to open multiple teleportation gates simultaneously and explore multiple evil spirit spaces." "You choose one hundred large evil spirits, divide them into different numbers of teams, and explore separately on a trial basis." "Understood!" Dejagal's demon hand felt a sense of awe in his heart, knowing that perhaps his master had encountered some turning point. Otherwise, he wouldn't suddenly be so urgently mobilizing a large-scale exploration.
