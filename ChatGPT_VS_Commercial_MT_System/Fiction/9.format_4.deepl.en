"This is to take you to feel the breath fluctuation, it's really simple." Another warlock on the side couldn't help but interject with a smile as well. "Then I'll be grateful." Lin Sheng nodded his head. He needed to find the other fragments as quickly as possible, originally he had planned to government more evil spirits and obtain more pure soul power. But now since he had come across this opportunity, getting it in his hands as fast as possible was the way to go. Soon, the chief warlock led Lin Sheng to stand in front of an evil spirit door. The two reached out and gently touched the edge of the evil spirit door at the same time and closed their eyes. The chief warlock quickly used his psychic powers and began to build a spatial base plate as coordinates to establish. Then following the ritual fluctuations of the evil spirit door, taking Lin Sheng's perceptual awareness with him, they were launched out together by the ritual fluctuations. "The ordinary portal ritual, is a point-to-point directional transmission." "But we generally explore other spatial mysteries by transforming this point-to-point, into point-to-many." "This only requires a small modification of a small parameter on the transmission baseplate." The chief warlock led Lin Sheng's consciousness while imparting the relevant techniques. "In this way, the evil spirit gate will spontaneously teleport our consciousness into multiple possible places that resemble the target space." "This is actually using energy to try our luck, with good luck, we can hit the secret space we want at once, with bad luck, we will have to waste energy to try a few more times." "It's really random enough." Lin Sheng was speechless. As soon as his perception entered the Evil Spirit Gate, he was immediately wrapped up in the ritual fluctuations within it, firing outward and dispersing. At the same time, it was as if his consciousness had split, and his perceptual awareness was separated into more than ten copies, perceiving more than ten completely different spatial auras at the same time. "Generally speaking, it is difficult to maintain the integrity of our consciousness during the transmission process, so we can only try to remember the coordinates of the space that the main consciousness has come into contact with." "The memory of the coordinates requires us to leave a simple marker ...." The chief warlock outside was still explaining in a low voice, while guiding Lin Sheng, teaching him how to make a simple marker so as to determine the coordinate code. But he did not expect at all that the consciousness soul of the spirit lock, because it was too strong and tough, was split out, and after more than ten copies of the space that the consciousness touched, he was able to memorize all the coordinates of it. But it's just one mind with ten more uses. This is not much for the soul consciousness can be one mind N use Lin Sheng. He was exercising the skill of tens of uses of one mind every day. Every summoned object, he can control and observe through the split consciousness soul. So now although he can not do a person at the same time to control many summons separate independent action. But just memorize the breath fluctuations and set up the coordinates separately. Plus his own soul is tougher than the average person and exists for a longer period of time. This is still very easy. Ten minutes later. The consciousness was consumed and dispersed. Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the chief warlock several people. "Locate the spatial secret realm for me at this coordinate." He immediately stated the coordinates of one of the special spatial secret realms under the jaw-dropping gaze of the Chief Warlock and the others. The spatial secret realm with this coordinate was the very same one that Lin Sheng had perceived, the special space that possessed the same origin as the Yin Turning Evil Wheel fragment in his arms. "Did it work in one go?" The chief warlock had some bitterness in his heart, when he first perceived the spatial aura, determined the coordinates and recorded them, but it took more than half a month to make it. "A very simple operation." "Let's start, establish the portal." "I want to go there." Lin Sheng commanded. "Yes." "Wait for the main body." Tian Gong Xia's soul transmission caused Lin Sheng to stall in his movements. "What?" While he watched as the chief warlock and the others began to order the evil spirits to move the material resources over, he stepped aside and waited, while exchanging voice transmissions with Tian Gong Xia in his mind. "There is a situation over here. Over on Bisaga Island, there's a big shift!" Tian Gong Xia's tone was vaguely gloomy. This was a sign that Lin Sheng had never seen before. He knew that even when he had told Tiangong Xia about the existence of the Night King, he had never seen her this serious. This made him feel a hint of unusual tension. "Mizuki should be at an absolute disadvantage, right?" Lin Sheng asked with a frown. "Or did a new battle force join?" "No, it's not a new battle force." Tian Gong Xia solemnly said. "Rather, Yayoi lied to everyone!" "???? What happened?" "The Seven Locked Towers were successfully summoned long ago... Yayoi Moon tricked everyone in the three secret realms... he had already successfully summoned Faludo! Using himself as a sacrifice! He had become one with it!" Lin Sheng's consciousness suddenly stalled. "Using himself as a sacrifice?" "...... This madman!" "So, now the three great mysteries are facing the fused monster of Mizuki plus Faludo ...." Lin Sheng was speechless. "What should we do now?" Tian Gong Xia said gruffly. Faroudeau combined with Yayoi, the superposition of these two is not as simple as one plus one equals two, but the end of three times ten. "Don't get excited." "For Mizuki and Faludo, the biggest enemy is still the three great secret realms and the many other great powers." "And this world isn't as simple as you think." Lin Sheng thought of the information he had investigated and obtained before. "The Great Star Pool, and those guys who hold the Heavenly Destiny Sacred Artifacts, are not simple characters." "As long as he doesn't come to provoke us, we don't bother to care how they develop." "I understand what you mean." "But it's best to make preparations early." Tian Gongxia reminded. "I once had that level of destructive power. It was during the period when I was manipulated by the magic sword." "So I know very well what kind of results that level of power would lead to." Lin Sheng was silent. Of all his commanders, Tian Gong Xia was the most special one. This was because Tian Gong Xia had once been controlled by the influence of some special and powerful existence. At that time, she had even detected Lin Sheng's prying eyes in her memory flashbacks. Just a mere image imprint in the memory, but actually still able to discover the peeping memory Lin Sheng. Such a power was beyond Lin Sheng's comprehension. "I know." Lin Sheng replied once again. "I will be prepared." "Don't worry." The great thing was to turn on the strongest kind of special state and summon all the unified power and fuse it into itself. Disconnecting from Tian Gong Xia, Lin Sheng quietly gazed at the brand new Evil Spirit Gate that had just been constructed. The mind reverted back to the original thought. "It's opened. Your Holiness." The head warlock whispered. Lin Sheng stared at the portal and was silent for a moment. "Let the Goblin King come over. Also, Dejar!" The Dejar Demon Hand had already arrived and waited nearby. Hearing the summons, he immediately walked in through the doorway. "Your Holiness, at your command." Lin Sheng nodded his head. "I want to open multiple portals at the same time and explore multiple evil spirit spaces." "You select a hundred Great Evil Spirits, divide them into different number of teams, and explore them separately on a trial basis." "As ordered!" Dejar Demonhand's heart was aghast, knowing that I'm afraid that His Holiness had met some kind of twist. Otherwise it would not suddenly be so urgent to explore on a large scale.
