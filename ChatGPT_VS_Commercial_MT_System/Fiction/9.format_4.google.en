"This is really simple to take you to feel the fluctuation of breath." Another warlock on the side couldn't help but smile.	 "Then there is labor." Lin Sheng nodded.	 He needed to find other fragments as quickly as possible. Originally, he intended to have more evil spirits and obtained more pure soul power.	 But now that you have encountered such opportunities, getting the fastest speed is the king.	 Soon, the warlock leader led Lin Sheng to stand in front of a evil spirit.	 The two reached out and gently touched the evil spirits at the same time, closed their eyes.	 The warlock's leader quickly started to build a space base disc as a coordinate.	 Then follow the ritual fluctuations of the evil spirit door, brought Lin Sheng's sense of perception, and was launched by the ritual fluctuations.	 "The ordinary portal ceremony is a point -to -point orientation transmission." "But we generally explore other space secrets, and this point is to transform this point to more points." "This only needs to modify a little bit of parameters on the transmission base disk."	 The consciousness, while imparting related skills.	 "In this way, the evil spirits will spontaneously transmit our consciousness into the possibility of multiple target spaces." "This is actually using energy to touch luck, good luck, we can hit us all at once, we want to think about	 The secret of the space, bad luck, we have to waste energy a few more times. "" It's really random. "Lin Sheng was speechless.	 As soon as his perception entered the evil spirit door, he was immediately fluctuated by the ritual, wrapped around and spread out.	 At the same time, he was like a division of consciousness. He was separated into more than ten copies, and at the same time felt more than a dozen completely different space atmosphere.	 "Generally speaking, our consciousness is difficult to maintain integrity during transmission, so we can only try to remember the space coordinates that the consciousness contacts." "The memory of the coordinates requires us to leave a simple mark ..." The long -term warlock is still explaining whispering, while guiding Lin Sheng to teach him how to make a simple mark, thereby determining the coordinate code.	 But he did not expect that the soul of Ling Suo's consciousness was too strong and tough, and after being split out, more than a dozen spaces that consciousness came into contact with, all he could remember the coordinates.	 But it is just more than a dozen.	 This is nothing for Lin Sheng, which can be used by soul consciousness.	 He is training dozens of skills every day.	 Each summoner can control the observation through the soul of division.	 So although he can't do a person at the same time, he can also control many summoners at the same time.	 But just the breath fluctuates under the memory, and set the coordinates respectively.	 Coupled with his own soul, he is more intense than the average person, and it has longer existence.	 This is still very easy.	 ten minutes later.	 The consciousness was exhausted and dispersed.	 Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the warlock commander.	 "Give me the mysterious space of this coordinates." He immediately said one of the special space mysterious coordinates under the eyes of the warlock and others. The mystery of this coordinate space is exactly what Lin Sheng perceives and has a special space that is homologous to the same source of the evil wheel fragment with his arms.	 "Is it successful at a time?" The warlock was a bit bitter. He first perceived the space of the space, determined the coordinates and recorded it, but it took more than half a month to make it.	 "Very simple operation." "Start, build a portal." "I want to pass." Lin Sheng ordered.	 "Yes." "Wait and other ontology." Tian Gongxia's soul passed down, which caused Lin Sheng to move.	 "how?" While watched the warlock, the warlock and others began to instruct the evil spirits to move the material resources, and walked to the side and waited, and at the same time communicated with Tian Gongxia in his mind.	 "There is a situation here. There is a major change in Shatag Island!" Sky Gongxia's tone was a little dignified.	 This is a sign that Lin Sheng has never seen it.	 You know, even if he told Tian Gongxia to the existence of the night of the night, he had never seen her so serious.	 This made him feel a trace of abnormal tension.	 "Miyue should be at an absolute disadvantage?" Lin Sheng frowned.	 "Or do you have a new combat power to join?" "No, not a new combat power." Tiantiaxia solemnly said. "But Miyue cheated everyone!" "? ?? What happened?"	 Rudo! Using himself as a sacrifice! It is integrated with it! "Lyrumon suddenly stagnated.	 "Taking yourself as a sacrifice?" "... This lunatic!" "So, the three secrets now face are Miyue and Faruando's fusion monster ..." Lin Sheng is speechless	 So as right.	 "What should we do now?" Tian Gongxia dignified. Faando combined with Miyue, the superposition of the two is not as simple as one plus one, but the end of the three times.	 "Don't be excited." "For Miyue and Faruado, the biggest enemy is the three major secrets and many other power." "And this world is not as simple as you think." Lin Sheng thought of the previous investigation,	 Get information.	 "Daxingchi, and those guys holding the Destiny Holy Instrument are not simple characters." "As long as he does not provoke us, we are too lazy to care about how they develop." "I understand what you mean." "	 But it is best to prepare early. "Sky Gongxia reminded.	 "I used to have that level of devastating power. It was during the period when I was manipulated by the magic sword." "So I know what kind of result of that level of power." Lin Sheng was silent.	 Among all his leaders, Tianongxia is the most special one.	 Because Tianongxia was controlled by some particularly powerful existence.	 At that time, she even realized Lin Sheng's peeping in the memory retrospective.	 It is just a image mark in a memory, and Lin Sheng, who can still find a peeping memory.	 This powerful has exceeded Lin Sheng's understanding.	 "I know." Lin Sheng replied again.	 "I will be prepared." "Don't worry." Start the strongest special state, summon all leadership forces, and integrate itself. Discarding the connection with Tianongxia, Lin Sheng quietly stared at the new evil spirit door that had just been built.	 Back to the original thinking.	 "Open it. Zun Shang." The warlock whispered.	 Lin Sheng stared at the portal, silently.	 "Let the Fairy King come over. In addition, De Jia!" The Deael Magic Hand had already waited nearby.	 When I heard the summons, I walked in from the door immediately.	 "Zun Shang, obey your instructions." Lin Sheng nodded.	 "I want to open multiple transmission doors at the same time to explore multiple evil spirits." "You choose a hundred evil spirits, divided into different number of teams, and tentatively explore." "Followed!" Degael's hands were stunned, knowing that I was afraid of what I had encountered.	 Otherwise, you will not suddenly explore such a large scale.
