" This is to bring you to feel the aura fluctuations. It's really very simple. " Another Warlock could not help but chime in with a smile. " Thank you for your help. " Lin Sheng nodded. He needed to find the other fragments as quickly as possible. He had originally planned to collect more evil spirits and obtain more pure soul power. But now that he had encountered such an opportunity, the fastest way to get it was to get it. Soon,The Warlock Leader led Lin Sheng to a door of the Evil Spirit Gate. Both of them reached out and touched the door frame of the Evil Spirit Gate at the same time. They closed their eyes. The Warlock Leader quickly used his ability to construct a space base as the coordinates were established. Then, following the ritual fluctuations of the Evil Spirit Gate, Lin Sheng's consciousness was sent out by the ritual fluctuations. " However, when we explore other dimensional realms, we usually change this point-to-point approach to point-to-many. This only requires a small modification of the parameters on the teleportation base. " The Warlock leader guided Lin Sheng's consciousness as he taught the relevant techniques. " This way, the Evil Spirit Gate will automatically teleport our consciousness to multiple possible places similar to the target space. This is actually using energy to try our luck. If we're lucky, we'll be able to use it to teleport our consciousness to other places." How random. " Lin Sheng was speechless. As soon as his perception entered the Evil Spirit Gate, it was immediately enveloped by the ritual fluctuations and shot out. At the same time, it was as if his consciousness was split into more than ten parts. At the same time, he could sense more than ten completely different spatial auras.It's hard to keep it intact, so we can only try to remember the spatial coordinates that the main consciousness came into contact with." " The memory of the coordinates requires us to leave a simple mark ... " The Warlock leader outside was still explaining in a low voice as he guided Lin Sheng and taught him how to make a simple mark to determine the coordinates. However, he did not expect that the consciousness of the Spirit Lock was too strong and tenacious. After it was split apart, the space that more than ten consciousnesses came into contact with ...He could memorize all the coordinates. It was just multitasking. This was nothing to Lin Sheng, who could multitask. He practiced the skill of multitasking every day. He could observe every summoned creature through his split consciousness. Although he could not control many summoned creatures to move independently at the same time, he could only memorize the aura fluctuations.Lin Sheng was only able to set the coordinates for each of them. In addition, his soul was stronger than the average person, and he had existed for a longer period of time. This was still a piece of cake. Ten minutes later, his consciousness was exhausted and dispersed. Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the Warlock Leader and the others. " Locate the spatial secret realm at this coordinate for me. " He immediately told the Warlock Leader and the others the coordinates of one of the special spatial secret realms. " Did you succeed in one try? " The Warlock leader was a little bitter. The first time he sensed the aura of space, he had taken more than half a month to determine the coordinates and record them. " It's a simple operation. " " Let's begin, build the portal. " " I'm going over, " Lin Sheng ordered. " Yes. " " Wait for the main body. " Tenko Kasumi's soul transmitted.Lin Sheng paused. " There's a situation here. There's a big change on the island of Bisaga! " Tenko Kasumi's tone was a little serious. This was something Lin Sheng had never seen before. Even if he had told Tenko Kasumi about the Night Monarch's existence, he would not have been able to tell her about it." Mi Yue should be at an absolute disadvantage, right? " Lin Sheng asked with a frown. " Or is there a new combat force joining us? " " It's Mi Yue who lied to everyone! " "??? What's going on? " " The Sevenlocks Tower has already been successfully summoned, and Mi Yue has lied to everyone in the three secret realms. He has already successfully summoned Faldt! Using himself as a sacrifice! He has fused with it! " Lin Sheng's consciousness froze." It's the fusion monster of Mi Yue and Faldt ... " Lin Sheng was speechless. " What should we do now? " Kasumi asked solemnly. " Don't get too excited. " " To Mi Yue and Faldt, their biggest enemies are still the three secret realms and many other major forces. " " And this world is not as simple as you think. " Lin Sheng thought of the information he had obtained from his previous investigation. " The Astral Mere, and those who possess the Sacred Vessel of Destiny."As long as he doesn't provoke us, we don't care how they develop. I understand what you mean. But it's best to be prepared," Tenko Kasumi reminded."I once had that level of destructive power. It was when I was controlled by the demon sword." " So I know exactly what kind of result that level of power will lead to. " Lin Sheng was silent. Of all his commanders, Tenko Kasumi was the most special one. That was because Tenko Kasumi had once been controlled by a powerful being. At that time, she even noticed Lin Sheng's spying in her memories. It was only a shadow imprint in her memories, but she was able to find Lin Sheng who was spying on her memories. Such power." I understand, " Lin Sheng replied again. " I'll be prepared. " " Don't worry. " At most, he would activate the strongest special state and summon all the commander's power to fuse with himself. Lin Sheng looked at the portal and was silent for a moment. " Let the Fairy King come over. Also, Djall! " Djall was already waiting nearby. Hearing the call, he immediately walked in from the door. " Your Majesty, I will follow your orders. " Lin Sheng nodded. " I will open multiple portals at the same time. "" Explore multiple Evil Spirit Spaces. Choose 100 Great Evil Spirits and divide them into different groups to explore. " " Yes, sir! " Degas Devilhand's heart trembled. He knew that His Holiness must have encountered a turning point. Otherwise, he wouldn't have suddenly started such a large-scale exploration in such a hurry.
