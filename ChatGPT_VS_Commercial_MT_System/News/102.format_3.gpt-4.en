Asian American Groups File Complaints Against Yale and Two Other Ivy League Schools for Admissions Discrimination - Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) - Over 130 Asian American groups filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting against admissions discrimination towards Asian applicants by three Ivy League institutions - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College. The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day. The group's chairman, Zhao Yikong, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission criteria for prestigious American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three prestigious American schools has remained basically the same. Many studies have shown that these universities, in the so-called "holistic admissions" process, have been "persistently and systematically discriminating against Asian applicants." Zhao Yikong explained that a study conducted by Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that among the three schools, the admission rate for Asians was the lowest among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants. Data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University had implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yikong told Xinhua reporters that they hope that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will initiate an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions once the facts are established. They also hope that the accused universities will proactively address this issue and change their admissions policies towards Asians. So far, the three universities have not yet responded to the complaint. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons. In addition to Chinese-American groups, this complaint also involved educational organizations representing Indian-Americans, Korean-Americans, Japanese-Americans, and Pakistani-Americans in the United States.
