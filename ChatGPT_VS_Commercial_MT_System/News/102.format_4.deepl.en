U.S. Asian groups complain about admissions discrimination at Yale and other 3 Ivy League schools - Xinhua Xinhua, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23 to protest against three Ivy League schools -- Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College -- in the admissions process Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College discriminate against Asian students in their admissions processes. The Asian American Education Coalition, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington, D.C., the same day. In the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants eligible for admission to top U.S. schools has grown exponentially, but the percentage of Asians at the three top U.S. schools has remained at essentially the same level, said the group's president, Yuh-Kong Cho, at the conference. Numerous studies have shown that these colleges and universities "systematically and consistently discriminate against Asian applicants over time" in the so-called "holistic" admissions process. Yukong Zhao described a 2014 study by scholars such as Sanders that showed that Asians had the lowest acceptance rate of all ethnicities relative to the number of applicants at the three colleges. Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, and that Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicant students for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect that after submitting their complaints, the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice will investigate and take measures to stop these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after the facts are determined. They also hope that the colleges and universities under complaint can take the initiative to pay attention to this problem and change their admissions policies for Asians. At present, the three colleges and universities that were the subject of the complaint have not yet responded. The Asian Education Coalition, founded in 2015, had complained about admissions discrimination at Harvard University at the time, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds. This time, in addition to Chinese American groups, those involved in the complaint also include Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American education groups.
