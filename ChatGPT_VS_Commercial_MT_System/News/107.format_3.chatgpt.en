After the "Democratic Summit" ended on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman gave a statement on Saturday (December 11th), saying that the United States hosting the "Leaders' Democratic Summit" is a move to "demarcate by ideology, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, incite division and confrontation under the guise of false democracy, and divert domestic contradictions." The Chinese government believes that for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, carried out "democratic transformations," indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated "color revolutions," and caused disastrous consequences. "Democracy" has long become a large-scale and lethal weapon used by the United States to interfere in other countries. This summit is an action by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises. The two-day conference was held via video, with 111 global leaders invited to participate, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited. On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States over its own democratic issues, saying that the US was not qualified to host such a summit. There were also voices of skepticism both internationally and domestically in the US, such as criticism of leaders invited to the summit who have authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, among others. Some people suspect that the true intention of the Biden administration in organizing the summit was not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes. The newly elected German Chancellor, Scholz, also participated in the video democracy summit. China's Foreign Ministry stated on Saturday that "today's American democracy is pathological, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts, wealth differentiation, and so on. American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital foundation." In his speech, President Biden stated, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, drive reforms, achieve transparent accountability governance, and better withstand the buffer and impact of authoritarian forces, as well as those who nakedly pursue power before the public interest." He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted and "we must constantly renew it in every generation, in my opinion, this is a decisive challenge of our time." Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend them at a time when they face persistent and worrying challenges."  The US side has promised to launch a year-long action after the democracy summit, including an initiative worth $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media. The US hopes that all countries will make specific, public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical democracy summit planned for the end of 2022. Biden said, "Let's all countries fulfill our commitments and report our progress next year."
