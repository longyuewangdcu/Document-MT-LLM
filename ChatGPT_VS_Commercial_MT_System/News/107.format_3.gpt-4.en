(Deutsche Welle Chinese) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on Saturday (December 11th), stating that the United States hosting the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is an act of "drawing ideological lines, turning democracy into a tool and weapon, practicing anti-democracy in the name of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and diverting domestic conflicts." The Chinese government believes that, "For a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation,' abused unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions,' and caused disastrous consequences. 'Democracy' has long become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere in other countries." The summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise. The two-day conference was held via video, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to participate, including Taiwan's leader, but China and Russia were not invited. On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democracy issues, stating that the US is not qualified to host such a summit. Internationally and within the US, there are also voices of doubt, such as criticizing the invited attendees, which include some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration in organizing the summit is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes. The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also attended the video Democracy Summit. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Saturday, "Today's American democracy is in a pathological state, with money politics, identity politics, partisan conflicts, political polarization, social divisions, racial conflicts, and wealth disparities becoming more and more intense." The US democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital foundation. In his speech, US President Biden said, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the safeguards of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, better resist the buffering and impact forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who blatantly pursue power before public interest." He emphasized that democracy should not be taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in every generation; in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time." Biden also said that global democracy and human rights are "facing ongoing and worrying challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend it." The United States pledged to launch a year-long action following the Democracy Summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy worldwide and support independent news media. The US hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the in-person Democracy Summit scheduled for the end of 2022. Biden said, "Let all of our countries implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."
