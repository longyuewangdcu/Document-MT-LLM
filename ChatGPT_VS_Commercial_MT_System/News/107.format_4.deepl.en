ï¼ˆAfter the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement on Saturday (Dec. 11) that the U.S. had organized the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" to "draw ideological lines, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, use democracy as a pretext to fight against democracy, incite division and confrontation, and divert domestic conflicts". The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, pursued 'democratic transformation,' imposed indiscriminate unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions,' with disastrous consequences. Democracy' has long become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for U.S. intervention in other countries. The summit was an attempt by Biden to make good on his campaign promises. The two-day meeting was conducted by video and 111 leaders from around the world were invited, including the leader of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited. On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for problems with its own democracy, saying it was not qualified to host such a summit. And there were doubts internationally and within the United States, such as criticism that the invited participants included leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some doubts that the Biden administration's real intentions were not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American democracy is sickly, with money politics, identity politics, party rivalry, political polarization, social cleavage, racial tensions, and the division between rich and poor getting worse and worse" and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" based on capital. President Joe Biden said in his speech, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, and to be more resistant to the buffers and shocks of tyranny and those who want to pursue power nakedly before the public good. " He stressed that democracy is not something to be taken for granted and that "we must renew it in every generation, which, in my view, is the defining challenge of our time. "Biden added that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of continuing and troubling challenges. For its part, the U.S. pledged to follow up the Democracy Summit with a year-long initiative that includes $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media. The United States expects countries to make specific public commitments to improve their democracies before the physical Democracy Summit, scheduled for the end of 2022. Biden said, "Let's all countries follow through on our commitments and report next year on the progress we've made.
