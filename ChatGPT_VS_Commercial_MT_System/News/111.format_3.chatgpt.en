Education thoughts: How to make "academic elites" and "mediocre students" each get what they deserve in university exams - Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the exam format, and make the exams truly reflect the students' actual abilities. Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic." In university campuses, students come from all over the world, with varying abilities and levels of learning, making the learning situation vastly different. It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when assessing such a diverse group of people. Of course, if the exam questions are monotonous, with a high repetition rate, and too simple, it will certainly lead to a completely different feeling. Students who do not study hard may be able to pass the exam by intensive studying before the exam. If they think of other ways, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort. In this way, the situation arises where "mediocre students" can pass without putting in much effort and even get high scores, while "academic elites" who never miss classes, have good homework and notes, and do not score much higher on exams, experience a "strange situation." In this sense, it can be said that the students who wrote the letter at Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not without reason in reflecting the problems in university exams, and it is believed that this situation is not limited to Lanzhou Jiaotong University. From this perspective, one must applaud the three students who wrote the letter. In fact, those who have been to university are well aware that the phenomenon of intensively preparing for exams and seeking various ways to "get" exam questions from teachers and gain an understanding of the exam scope is not uncommon, and even smuggling in small cheat sheets or asking teachers for help after the exam is not a strange occurrence. In the author's opinion, as a kind of assessment of teaching quality, measuring the qualification of a university exam depends more on teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and scientific proposition based on this foundation. In the undergraduate stage of university, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are mainly based on basic knowledge. Undoubtedly, whether comprehensive mastery of the basic knowledge points of a subject is a content that must be examined in a university exam. The undergraduate knowledge is mostly based on the fundamental theories and basic knowledge of the subject, and from the perspective of knowledge points, the change space is not large and is basically fixed. As some teachers say, "the basic knowledge learned in college mathematics 20 years ago is still the focus today." However, the basic knowledge points do not change, and this does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated. In many universities, the examination is generally composed of a question-setting group, which is then composed of senior subject teachers. The examination marking is also participated by all teachers in charge of the subject, so as to overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent. However, in order to formulate a set of examination questions that are in line with teaching and learning practices, the questions need to be based on the overall learning situation of the students and have a normal distribution of difficulty, and also need to master the teaching situation comprehensively, analyze the students' learning level, so as to make the examination proposition dynamically grasp the difficulty and question type, highlighting the examination of basic knowledge and also taking into account the ability examination, and at the same time innovating the question type design. Examination is the baton of university education, and students will have corresponding examination preparation plans according to the type of examination, which will affect the effectiveness of university education over time. The suggestion letter for students is highly valued by the school authorities of Lanzhou Jiaotong University, and a rectification plan has been deployed throughout the school. The school requires all teaching units to organize teachers to carry out research, compare the final exam with self-examination, formulate exam papers, and establish relevant regulations. At the same time, the supervision and inspection of the examination paper proposition and review process are strengthened, grading is refined, and the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of the course teaching is reinforced. Solving the problem of single-type test questions and repeated questions is an issue that university examinations need to face, and of course, corresponding regulations need to be introduced. However, practice is more important than anything else, and teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only to master the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation. With both the teacher and student understanding the situation well, teaching and learning will be better connected and form a positive interaction. The exam will also be more in line with reality, thus allowing both "academic elites" and "academic underperformers" to get what they deserve.
