Educational Thoughts: How can university exams cater to both top and struggling students? - Xinhua Net. Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leadership, expressing their confusion about university exams and proposing to increase the difficulty of exams, change the types of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the actual level of students. Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic." On university campuses, students come from all over the country with varying levels of ability, different degrees of learning, and diverse learning situations. Assessing such a diverse group inevitably leads to different feelings and experiences. Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, have a high repetition rate, and are overly simplistic, it will inevitably lead to a completely different experience. Students who do not put in the effort may be able to pass by cramming right before the exam, and if they employ other methods, they might achieve more with less effort. As a result, struggling students can pass or even achieve high scores without much effort, while top students, who never miss class and excel in homework and note-taking, may not perform much better in exams, creating a "strange situation." In this regard, the concerns raised by the students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University about university exams are not unfounded, and it is believed that this situation is not unique to their university. In this sense, the three students who directly addressed their concerns in the letter deserve praise. In fact, those who have attended university are well aware that cramming for exams, trying various ways to obtain exam questions from teachers, striving to narrow down the exam scope, and seeking "focused tutoring" before exams are not uncommon phenomena. Even cheating during exams or pleading with teachers for leniency afterwards are not unheard of. In the author's opinion, as a means of evaluating teaching quality, the success of a university exam lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and their ability to set scientific questions based on this understanding. Upon entering the undergraduate stage, majors become more specialized, and many specialized courses focus on basic knowledge. There is no doubt that mastering the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content that university exams aim to assess. Undergraduate knowledge mostly consists of basic subject theories and common sense, and the scope for change in knowledge points is not large, as they are generally fixed. As one teacher said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics that was taught 20 years ago is still being taught and remains a key focus." However, the fact that knowledge points remain largely unchanged does not mean that exam question types are monotonous and repetitive. In many universities, exam questions are usually prepared by a question-setting group and then coordinated by experienced subject teachers to create test papers. All teachers responsible for the subject participate in grading the exams, which helps overcome the issue of question repetition to a certain extent. However, to develop a test that truly reflects teaching and learning, with questions based on the overall learning situation of students and a normal distribution of difficulty levels, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation and thoroughly analyze students' learning progress. This will allow for a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and question types in exam design, emphasizing both basic knowledge assessment and ability assessment while innovating the question types. Exams are the guiding force in university education, and students will develop corresponding exam preparation strategies based on the types of exams. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education. In response to the students' suggestion letter, Lanzhou Jiaotong University took it very seriously and has already deployed a rectification plan across the school. The school requires each teaching unit to organize teachers for discussions and self-checks comparing course completion exams, develop exam question-setting and related systems, and strengthen supervision and inspection of the question-setting and review process. They also aim to refine the assessment of scores and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of each aspect of course teaching. Addressing issues such as monotonous question types and repetitive questions from a structural perspective is a topic that university examination administration needs to face. While introducing corresponding policies is essential, the real effort lies in daily practice, requiring teachers to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation. This means not only fully grasping the teaching content but also understanding students' learning situations. By thoroughly understanding both aspects, teaching and learning will be better aligned, creating a positive interaction, and exams will become more realistic, allowing both top and struggling students to find their place.
