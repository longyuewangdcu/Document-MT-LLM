Education Thinking: How to make the university exams "bully" "dregs" each in their place - Xinhua.com Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the university leadership, reflecting their confusion about the university exams and proposing to improve the difficulty of the exams, change the type of exam questions, so that the exams really reflect the students The demand of the actual level of the students. Indeed, university exams have long been a "hot topic". On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, and with different levels of study, their learning situation is very different. It is inevitable that such a diverse group of students will have different feelings about the assessment. Of course, if the exam test questions are single, high repetition rate, the questions are too simple, it will certainly cause another very different feeling. Students who don't work hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating on the blitz before the exam, and if they think of other ways, they may achieve twice the effect with half the effort. In this way, there is a "dregs" usually do not put in can also pass, and even scored high; " hegemony" usually never drop class, homework, notes are good, the test is not much higher than the "strange status quo " . In this way, it seems that Lanzhou Jiaotong University students reflect the problems in the university examination is not without reason, and I believe that this situation is not only Lanzhou Jiaotong University exists. In this sense, we should praise the three students who have written letters to express their views. In fact, people who have been to college are well aware that it is not uncommon for people to prepare for exams unannounced, to find various ways to "get" exam questions from teachers, to get the scope of the exam, to get "key tutoring" before the exam, and even to carry a cheat sheet in the exam, after the exam to beg the teacher to lift the hand The situation is not uncommon. In my opinion, as a kind of teaching quality assessment guide, the measure of a university examination is more on the teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific questions based on this. At the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge. There is no doubt that whether a comprehensive mastery of the basic knowledge of a subject is the content to be examined in university examinations. And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic general knowledge of the subject, in terms of knowledge points, there is not much room for change, is basically fixed. As a teacher said , " 20 years ago to learn the basics of college mathematics, and still learning, or focus . "But the knowledge is basically the same, does not mean that the exam questions single, test questions repeat. In many universities, exams are generally composed of question groups, and then the senior teachers of the subject to coordinate the composition of the test paper, the test marking is also undertaken by the subject of all teachers to participate, so that to a certain extent to overcome the duplication of test questions. However, in order to develop a set of test questions in line with the actual teaching and learning, the questions are normally distributed in terms of difficulty and ease according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the extent of students' learning, so that the test questions have a dynamic grasp of difficulty and question type, which can highlight the examination of basic knowledge and also take into account the ability test, and at the same time make innovative designs for question types. Examinations are the baton of university education, with what kind of examinations, students will have the corresponding preparation program, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run. Regarding the students' suggestion letter, the university of Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a plan to rectify the situation in the whole university. Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and course final examinations against self-examination, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and review links, refine the evaluation of grades, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching. From the mechanism to solve the problem of a single type of test questions, repetitive questions and other issues is the university examination needs to face the issue, of course, need to introduce the corresponding system, but the work is expensive in the daily, need teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, more must eat through the students learning situation, both ends eat through, teaching and learning will be better docking, the formation of positive interaction, the examination will also be more in line with the actual, so that The "school bully" and "school dregs" each get their own.
