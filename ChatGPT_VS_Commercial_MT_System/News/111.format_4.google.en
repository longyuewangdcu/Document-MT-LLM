Educational thinking: How to make "Xueba" and "Study Studies" each of the university tests-Xinhuanet Lanzhou Jiaotong University 3 students wrote to the school leaders, reflecting the confusion of college examinations, and proposed the difficulty of improving the examination, changing the test type of the exam, letting it allows	 The exam truly reflects the actual demands of students.	 Indeed, for a long time, college exams have been a "hot topic".	 On the university campus, students are from all over the world, with different levels of ability.	 It is inevitable that there are different feelings for assessment of groups with such diverse characteristics. Of course, if the test questions are single and the repeat rate is high, the question is too simple, which will inevitably cause another very different feeling.	 Students who do not do hard work may pass the assault before the test. If you think about other ways, you may achieve more effort.	 In this way, "learning scum" can usually pass the level or even get high scores; "Xueba" usually never leaves classes.	 Essence	 From this point of view, the students of the Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflected that the problems in the university exam were not without reason. I believe that this situation does not only exist in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.	 In this sense, it is necessary to like these three students who write straight. In fact, everyone who has been in college knows that assault preparation and wanting to "take" questions from the teachers from the teacher, strive for the scope of the examination, and obtain the phenomenon of "key counseling" before the test.	 It is not surprising that the situation of using a small copy and asking the teacher to raise your hands after the test.	 In my opinion, as a teaching quality assessment orientation, measuring the qualifications of a university exam is the comprehensive grasp of teachers and scientific propositions on this basis.	 Entering the undergraduate stage of college, majors have begun to segmented, and many professional courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.	 Undoubtedly, whether to fully master the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content of the college test.	 The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic knowledge of the subject. From the perspective of knowledge points, the space of change is not large, and it is basically fixed. As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of math in college 20 years ago was still studying, and it was still the focus." But the knowledge point is basically unchanged, and it does not mean that the test questions are single and repeated test questions.	 In many universities, the exams generally form a group issuing group, and then the test papers are composed of senior teachers of the subject. The test papers are also involved in all teachers who undertake the subject. This can overcome the repeated test questions to a certain extent.	 However, it is necessary to draw up a set of test questions that conform to the actual education and learning. The topic is based on the overall situation of students 'learning. It is difficult to distribute normally. It is also necessary to comprehensively master the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the level of students' learning, so that the test propositions are difficult and difficult.	 The question type has dynamic grasping, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge inspection, but also take into account the ability to examine, and at the same time innovate the question type.	 The exam is a command stick for university education. What kind of exams are there, students will have the corresponding test preparation plan. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education. For students' suggestions, Lanzhou Jiaotong University school attaches great importance to the deployment of rectification plans in the school.	 All teaching units are required to organize teachers to conduct seminars and curriculum examinations for self -examination, formulate test paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of the test papers and review links, refine the results of the results, strengthen the course teaching of all aspects of the curriculum teaching	 Comprehensive assessment.	 Solving the types of test questions in the mechanism, the problem of duplicate questions, etc. are issues that need to be faced by college tests. Of course, the corresponding system needs to be introduced.	 It is also necessary to eat through students' learning situation. Ending on both ends, teaching and learning will be better connected, forming a benign interaction, and the test will be more actual, so that "learning hegemony" and "scum" will have their own place.
