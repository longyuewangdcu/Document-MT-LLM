Educational thinking:In 2016, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, Berkeley, were awarded the "Best Student Award" by the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, Berkeley. In 2016, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, Berkeley were awarded the "Best Student Award".The learning situation varies widely. It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when assessing groups with such diverse characteristics. Of course, if the exam questions type single, repetition rate is high, the topic is too simple, will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.Don't work hard students, may focus on the assault before the exam can pass, if think of other ways, may achieve twice the result with half the effort effect.As a result, appear "study slag" usually do not invest can pass, even got high marks;"Learning bully" Usually never drop class, Homework, Notes everything is good, Exam also did not much higher "Strange status quo". In this way, Lanzhou jiaotong university students reflect the problems in the university exam is not without reason, Believe this situation is not only lanzhou jiaotong university exists.In this sense, To write for the three students point praise. In fact, people who have been to university are clear that it is not uncommon to prepare for the exam, think of various ways to "take" the test questions from the teacher, strive to delimit the scope of the exam, and get "key guidance" before the exam. It is not uncommon to even carry cheat sheets in the exam and ask the teacher to be lenient after the exam. In my opinion, as a teaching quality evaluation orientation, measuring whether a university is qualified or not depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning.And on this basis of scientific proposition.Into the undergraduate stage, Professional began to subdivide, Many professional courses to basic knowledge-based. No doubt, Whether a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge of a discipline, Is the university examination to examine the content.And undergraduate knowledge is basic theory and basic knowledge of the discipline, From the knowledge point, Change of space is not big, Basic is fixed. Just like some teachers said,"20 years ago to learn the basic knowledge of college mathematics, Now still in school, Or the key." But the knowledge point is basically unchanged, Does not mean that the test type is single, Test questions repetition.In many universities, The exam will generally form a question group, Then by the subject senior teachers co-ordinate the composition of the paper, Exam marking also by the responsibility of the subject of all teachers to participate in,In this way, we can overcome the repetition of test questions to a certain extent. But we should draw up a set of test questions that are in line with the actual teaching and learning. According to the overall situation of students 'learning, the difficulty and ease of the test questions are normally distributed. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the test questions can have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and the type of questions. It can not only highlight the basic knowledge inspection, but also give consideration to the ability test. At the same time, the test questions are innovatively designed. The test is the baton of college education.What kind of examination, students will have the corresponding preparation plan, in the long run, will affect the effectiveness of university education. Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to the students 'letter of suggestion and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school. All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of course end examinations, formulate examination paper proposition and relevant systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper proposition and audit links, refine score evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching. Solve the problem of single type of test questions from mechanism,Problems such as repetition of questions are the issues that university examination affairs need to face. Of course, corresponding systems need to be issued. However, kung fu is expensive in daily life, which requires teachers to fully grasp the teaching situation. They should not only understand the teaching content, but also understand the students 'learning situation. Both ends should be thoroughly understood. Teaching and learning will be better connected to form benign interaction, and the examination will be more realistic, so as to make "learning bully" and "learning scum" Each has its place.
