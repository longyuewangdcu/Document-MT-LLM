"3,200 new born babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper (Kota Kinabalu, 11th February News) The National Registration Department in Sabah stated that since the supply of special anti-counterfeit paper has been depleted, birth certificates for newborns have not been issued since early October, and the number of those affected has accumulated to 3,200 people. However, the department's director, Kurami Nusus, guaranteed that all newborns who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system and will be issued with the certificates once the anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week. He explained this at a press conference in response to a media report that the issue of Sabah birth certificate printing has been ongoing for as long as 10 months. He said that the issue arose 2 months ago and that Sarawak is facing the same problem." "One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer of the special anti-counterfeit paper has been affected by the epidemic, causing a delay in its arrival in our country," he explained. The anti-counterfeit paper used for Sabah birth certificates is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from the stocks in other states. Kurami Nusus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing. "The department will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods on Thursday next week and immediately start the final stage of printing in Sabah. It is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicants' hands in two more working days (December 20)," he said. "We will notify the applicants to go to the local branches to pick up their birth certificates." He added that a total of 20,801 birth certificates have been issued in Sabah so far this year.
