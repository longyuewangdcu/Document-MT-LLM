"3,200 newborns in Sabah without birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper (Kota Kinabalu, March 11) - The Sabah National Registration Department stated that since early October, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns due to the depletion of the special anti-counterfeit paper stock, and the number of affected individuals has accumulated to 3,200. However, the department's director, Kairul Aminus, assured that the information of all babies who have applied for birth certificates has been recorded in the system, and the certificates will be issued once the anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week. He made this explanation at a press conference in response to a report by an online media outlet claiming that the birth certificate printing issue in Sabah had persisted for up to 10 months. He said that the problem had occurred two months ago, and Sarawak is facing the same issue." "One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer producing the special anti-counterfeit paper has been affected by the pandemic, leading to delays in delivery to our country," he explained. The anti-counterfeit paper used for Sabah's birth certificates is different from that of other regions, so they cannot borrow stock from other states. Kairul Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work. "The department will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and upon returning to Sabah, they will immediately proceed with the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take another two working days (December 20th) to get the certificates into the hands of the applicants," he said. "We will notify the applicants to collect their birth certificates at the local branches." He added that so far this year, Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates.
