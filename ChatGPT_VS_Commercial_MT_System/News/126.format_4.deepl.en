The Sabah National Registration Authority said it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since the beginning of October because it ran out of stock of the special anti-counterfeit paper. However, the director of the bureau, Kairu Aminous, assured that all the babies who have applied for the birth certificate have their information recorded in the system and will be issued when the anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week. He explained at a press conference in response to a report in the online media that problems with the printing of Sabah's birth certificate had been occurring for as long as 10 months. He said the problem emerged 2 months ago and Sarawak is facing the same problem. "One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers who produce special security paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed arrival in our country . "He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah Newspaper Raw Paper is different from other regions and therefore cannot be commercially borrowed from stocks in other states. Kairu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, after which it was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work. "The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, back to Sabah immediately for the final stage of printing, it is estimated that 2 more working days (December 20) can be handed over to the applicant . " "We will inform the applicants to go to the branch offices to collect the birth registration paper .
