"48-hour negative nucleic acid test, establish 'buffer zone': the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council requires strengthened epidemic prevention and control measures in port cities" - Xinhua News Agency. The State Council Joint Defense and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring that individuals who recently left land border ports (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) must hold proof of a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours and undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival in the land border port city. According to the notice, the time frame for these requirements is from the date when the port city range is determined and announced by each province, to March 15, 2022. In addition, the notice also proposed that eligible port cities may study setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction. A relevant responsible person from the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and frequent exchanges between both sides of the border. Implementing differentiated management policies by region, from a single containment line to two lines, is expected to achieve a shift in the point of control, reducing the risk of spillover, and maximizing the effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost. In recent times, multiple outbreaks of local clusters of epidemics have occurred in China, all of which have been imported via ports and cities. The above notice pointed out that this reveals some problems such as: timely monitoring and warning of the epidemic situation in some areas, the closure management of high-risk personnel is not implemented, regular nucleic acid tests are formalistic, the various links of cold-chain items are not fully killed, centralized quarantine facilities are not properly managed, and epidemic emergency response is not scientifically precise. The notice requires that efforts be made in 9 areas, including improving the mechanism of epidemic prevention and control in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up filling the shortfalls and weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, and to do a good job in epidemic prevention and control without relaxing, scientifically and precisely. The notice emphasizes that port cities must research and deploy the prevention and control of epidemics and the protection of people's livelihoods in parallel, and publish and facilitate hotlines for people's livelihood protection, regularly check for early signs of supply and price issues for basic living necessities, and promptly resolve and actively respond to prominent issues reflected by the masses. According to the notice, the referred port cities include the county (city, district, banner) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, the city (area, state, alliance) they are located in, and the directly governed city, and the specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, directly governed city) according to the epidemic prevention and control needs and promptly announced.
