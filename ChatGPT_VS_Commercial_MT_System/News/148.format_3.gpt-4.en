48-hour nucleic acid negative test required, "buffer zones" to be set up: The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism issued a document to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11th (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land border port cities (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours. People arriving in land border port cities are required to undergo at least one nucleic acid test. According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date when provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities determine the scope of port cities and announce it, until March 15, 2022. In addition, the notice also suggests that port cities with the necessary conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction. A relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau explained that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and the border residents on both sides frequently travel. Implement differentiated management policies by region, changing from a single line of defense against the overflow of epidemic prevention and control to two lines of defense, with the hope of moving the prevention and control measures forward, reducing the risk of epidemic overflow, and achieving the best results in epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and lowest social cost. Recently, there have been several local cluster outbreaks in China, all of which have been imported from overseas through port cities. The aforementioned notice pointed out that this exposes problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, ineffective closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, perfunctory regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection at various stages of cold chain items, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficiently scientific and precise emergency handling of the epidemic. The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to quickly make up for the shortcomings and weaknesses in port city prevention and control, and to do a good job in prevention and control work without any relaxation, scientifically and accurately, to weave a dense and strong line of defense against the importation of the epidemic from outside. The notice emphasizes that all port cities should study and deploy epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood protection work simultaneously, announce and unblock the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly investigate potential risks in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and promptly address and actively respond to prominent issues raised by the public. According to the notice, the port cities referred to include counties (cities, districts, and banners) where open land, water, and air ports are located, the cities (prefectures, states, and leagues) where they are located, and the municipalities directly under the central government. The specific scope will be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.
