48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up "buffer zone" State Council joint defense joint control mechanism issued a document to strengthen port city epidemic prevention and control-Xinhua Xinhua Agency, Beijing, Dec.11(Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The Joint Defense and Control Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of Xinguan pneumonia in port cities, requiring them to leave the land border port cities in the near future.(Except for those connected to ports in Hong Kong and Macao) Personnel shall hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and personnel going to land border port cities shall have at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
