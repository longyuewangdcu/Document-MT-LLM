The film tells the story of the United States war in Afghanistan in the name of "counter-terrorism", the forced export of American democracy through the war, 20 years of militarism, bloodlust, indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and various crimes against humanity. It abuses drones to air strike hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distorts human nature, and sets up killing teams. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghanistan civilians. The US military has set up "black jails" to torture and humiliate "suspects". Crimes against humanity have aroused hatred among more Afghans. As the video says, the US "anti-terrorism" war has "become more and more fearful". The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people. What it has brought is a devastated country and countless killings and destruction. Poke video, let's expose the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of "anti-terrorism" in the United States, and expose the false mask of American democracy!
