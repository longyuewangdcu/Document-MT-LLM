Don't scare people off at the starting line - Xinhua News When browsing book markets, one can often feel the popularity of success-oriented books. Many of the current success-oriented books advocate the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "achieve" something, and then tell you what you need to achieve. In other words, they skip over the most important and fundamental aspect of "how to achieve" it. As a result, these books have a common feature - either do your best in one go, or simply don't do anything at all; either aim for 100 or settle for 0; either climb Mount Tai, or simply stay put. This "best principle" may seem undeniably correct to anyone who reads it, but it scares 99% of people away before they even reach the starting line. This is because the theory advocates for a path that requires a determined mindset to make a complete 180-degree change in one's life, which happens to be a fatal weakness for many people. For those who are set in their ways, resistant to change, and follow tradition, shouting "you must change" in their ears is undoubtedly self-deceptive and like playing the lute to a cow - a futile effort. The vast majority of people will hesitate and falter in front of the idea of "change", unable to make up their minds; or they may impulsively decide to make the change and bravely take the first step, but often, this determination doesn't last long, and they soon falter, unable to sustain the effort. Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk, "Starting from Tomorrow," vividly illustrates this classic representation of "universal human nature." The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that it sets the bar too high, often surpassing the limits of ordinary people's abilities and causing the vast majority to "sigh at the doorstep." Perhaps the "next-best principle" is a more viable approach for ordinary people to achieve relative success. The core of the "next-best principle" is to "lower the bar" - it promotes the idea of "accumulating small victories for a big win." That is, if you can't achieve 100, even achieving 1 is acceptable: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing a small sand dune near your doorstep is fine, as it is still better than standing still. In short, doing something is always better than doing nothing. By significantly lowering the bar, there is a greater possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one perseveres in anything, the probability of success will increase. However, the path to success by following the "next-best principle" is slightly longer. In summary, although the "best principle" seemingly encourages everyone to succeed on the surface, in reality, it only inspires a minority. On the other hand, the "next-best principle" effectively motivates more people, aiming to benefit as many individuals as possible.
