Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua.com When you go to the book market, you can often feel the fire of success books. Many of today's success books preach the "best principle" -- that is, first assuming or implying that you can "do it" and then telling you what you need to do "What it is". That is to say, it is the most important and fundamental aspect of "how to do it" that has been crossed at once. Because of this, these books have a common feature - either you do the best you can or you don't do anything at all; either you are 100 or you are 0; either you climb Mount Tai or you simply stay where you are. This "best principle", let anyone look at it will admit that "correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated in front of the starting line. Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, do it all over again, make a 180-degree change", which is precisely the Achilles heel of many people. For people who are stuck in the old ways, who refuse to change, you have to shout "you have to change" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deceiving and self-deceptive. The vast majority of people will be in front of the word "change" cowardly, stagnant, difficult to make up their minds; or with the impulse of the moment painful "change" of the determination, and bravely take the first step, but often is not long, not much time to hold on to the It is difficult to see sustainability. Mr. Ma Sanli's famous comic strip "Starting from Tomorrow" is the classic that best expresses this "universal human nature". The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it is often beyond the limits of ordinary people's ability, so that the majority of people "sigh". Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a way to let more ordinary people on the road to relative success. The core of the "second-best principle" is "lowering the bar" - it encourages a theory of "small wins make big wins". The theory that if you can't do 100, you can do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0. If you can't climb Mount Tai, you can just climb the sand dune in front of your house, because that's better than standing still. In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not doing anything. Because the threshold is greatly reduced, so there are more possibilities for ordinary people to do persistence, and everything as long as persistence, the probability of success will also increase. The road to success is only a little longer when the "second best principle" is followed. In short, the "best principle", despite its apparent banner of success for all, can ultimately motivate a small number of people, while the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.
