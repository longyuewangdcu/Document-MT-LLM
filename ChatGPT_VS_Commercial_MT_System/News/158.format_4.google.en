Don't scare people when they start the starting line-Xinhuanet shopping market, often feel the popularity of successful books.	 Many of today's successful books are promoted to "best principles" - that is, first assumption or implies that you can "do", and then tell you what you need to do "what".	 It is equivalent to saying that "how to do" is actually the most important and fundamental link.	 Because of this, these books have a common characteristic -either to do it with a moment of anger, or just don't do anything; either 100 or 0; or you will be ascended to Taishan, or you will simply be in the original Yuan Yuan.	 Stay. This kind of "best principle" can be admitted to "correct", but 99%of people are scared to start in front of the starting line.	 Because this kind of theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, re -people, and a big change of 180 degrees", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.	 For those who are in Mo Shoucheng, because of the old, and rejection of changes, you have to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly a move of self -deception and playing the piano for cows.	 The vast majority of people will be timid in front of the word "transition", wrapped in the same way, and it is difficult to make determination;	 It ’s not long, I ca n’t persist for a long time, and it’ s hard to see the continuity.	 Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "Starting Tomorrow" is the most vivid manifestation of this "general humanity" classic. The biggest problem of the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often surpasses the limits of ordinary people's ability and allows most people to "look at the door and sigh."	 Perhaps, the "good principle" is a way that may allow more ordinary people to take a relatively successful road.	 The core of the "Times Good Principles" is to "reduce the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victory for great victory", that is, if you do not do 100, only 1 can be done: because 1 is always greater than 0 than 0	 ; If you can't board the Mount Tai, you can only board the small dunes in front of your house, because it is always better than the place.	 In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not.	 Because the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility that ordinary people can persist, and as long as everything persists, the probability of success will increase. It just follows the success of the "good principle", and its journey is slightly longer.	 All in all, although the "best principle" is the banner of everyone's success on the surface, what it can eventually motivate is actually a minority; and the "second good principle" can effectively inspire more people, as much as possible as possible, as much as possible as possible.	 Land benefit more people.
