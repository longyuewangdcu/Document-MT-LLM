Don't scare people at the starting line-Xinhuanet When you visit the book market, you can often feel the popularity of books on success. Today's success books, many of which promote the "best principle"-that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do. It is equivalent to saying that you have crossed the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it". Because of this,All these books have one thing in common- -they either do their best at one go or do nothing at all;It is either 100 or 0.Either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are. This "best principle" will make anyone admit that it is "absolutely correct", but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line. Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree change", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people. For those who stick to the rules, stick to the old ways, and refuse to change, you just have to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception.The vast majority of people will be "change" in the face of the word timid, hesitant, difficult to make up their minds;Or with a moment of impulse pain under the "change" of the determination, and bravely took the first step, but often is not good for a long time, adhere to not more than a while on the defeat, hard to see continuation.Mr. Ma Sanli that famous "From tomorrow" cross talk, is the most vivid expression of this "universal human nature" classic. The biggest problem with the best rule is that it sets too high a bar, often beyond the limits of what the average person can do, and leaves most people looking up and down. Perhaps the second-best rule is the way to get more average people on the path to relative success. At its core, the second-best rule is about lowering the bar-it encourages the theory that if you can't do 100, you can do 1:Because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that's better than standing still. In short, as long as you do something, it's better than nothing. Because the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persist, and as long as they persist in everything, the probability of success will increase. The road to success is only slightly longer if you follow the "second best principle." In short, although the "best principle" is ostensibly under the banner of making everyone successful, it can ultimately inspire a few.The "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
