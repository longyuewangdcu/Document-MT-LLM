Qinghai Lake Naked Carp Resources Increase by 0.71 Thousand Tons This Year - Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) - It was learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the resource reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp have increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108.5 thousand tons. This is a 40-fold increase compared to the beginning of the protection measures in 2002. The Qinghai Lake naked carp, also known as "Huang Fish", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake and plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" chain in the Qinghai Lake basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale human fishing and the degradation of the breeding environment for naked carp, the number of Qinghai Lake naked carp decreased sharply. In 2002, the resource reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp were only 2,592 tons. In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "China Species Red List". Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a fishing ban in Qinghai Lake, prohibiting any organizations, collectives, or individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and tributaries, and banning the sale of naked carp and its products. At the same time, protection efforts have been continuously strengthened through measures such as artificial breeding and stocking, cleaning up the main rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake, and designing scientifically sound "fish passage" channels. As a result, the resource reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp have increased year by year. Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially bred and stocked naked carp have been released into Qinghai Lake, contributing to more than 23% of the recovery of the naked carp resources. The Sanjiangyuan area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that prevents the spread of desertification in the western region. In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain biodiversity on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing ban notices for key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake this year, establishing a comprehensive fishing ban management system for "one river, one lake."
