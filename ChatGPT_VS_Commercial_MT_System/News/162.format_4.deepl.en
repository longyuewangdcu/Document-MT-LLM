Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserves increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua Xinhua News Agency Xining, Dec. 11 (Xinhua Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang), the reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the latest monitoring results show that the Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserves increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, compared with the initial protection in 2002, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times. The Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huanghuang fish", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the security and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake declined sharply due to factors such as extensive human harvesting and degradation of the breeding waters, and in 2002 the naked carp resource in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons. Since 2003, Qinghai Province has been closed to fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, group or individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products. At the same time, the amount of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year through artificial stocking, cleaning up the main rivers into the lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passage". Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said that up to now, the Qinghai Lake naked carp has been artificially released with a total of 180 million tails, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of the lake's naked carp resources. Qinghai's Three River Source area is an important ecological barrier and water-conserving area in China and Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east. In order to protect the ecological environment of the three rivers and Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Tibetan Plateau, this year, Qinghai has issued a ban on fishing in the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, building a comprehensive ban on fishing management system in one river and one lake.
