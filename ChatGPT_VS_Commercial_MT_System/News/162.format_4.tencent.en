Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserves increased by 0.71 million tons this year-Xinhuanet Xinhua Agency, Xining, December 11 th(Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Qinghai Province Department of Agriculture and Rural Areas that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial period of protection in 2002. The naked carp in Qinghai Lake is commonly known as "Huangyu" and is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake.It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological chain security and biodiversity of "water-fish-bird" in Qinghai Lake Basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply due to the influence of a large number of people 's hunting and the deteriorating environment of naked carp breeding waters. In 2002, the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons. In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of China Species. Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake to raise fish, prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from fishing naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products. At the same time, through artificial proliferation and release, as well as cleaning up the main rivers and rivers of Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages" and other measures to continuously increase protection, the reserves of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year. Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, introduced that as of now,Qinghai Lake Gymnocypris has implemented artificial breeding and release of nearly 180 million fish, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake Gymnocypris resources. Qinghai Sanjiangyuan region is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east. In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan region and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this year,Qinghai has successively issued notices prohibiting fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive management system of "one river, one river and one lake".
