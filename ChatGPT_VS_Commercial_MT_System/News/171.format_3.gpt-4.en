The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online Hunan Daily, December 10th (All-media reporters Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Hua Red Tea Promotion Conference were held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprint towards a 100-billion-yuan tea industry goal. Hou Shunli, deputy director of the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Council, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening ceremony. Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: The origin of Hunan Red Tea lies in New Hua, and the rise of red tea injects new vitality into the "Five-Colored Hunan Tea." In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of a 100-billion-yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed the development pattern of "Three Xiangs, Four Waters, and Five-Colored Teas." Tea industry in the province intensifies innovation, with main tea varieties such as green tea, dark tea, and red tea taking turns to exert their strength. Major tea-producing areas promote the integration of tea and tourism, boosting the income of tea farmers. As the saying goes, "fortune turns like a wheel," and red tea is making a strong comeback. Tea experts in the province say that after harvesting green tea, tea farmers can harvest red tea and dark tea, ensuring income all year round and a steady rise in the value of tea gardens. At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded plaques to the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and New Hua proudly holds the title of the "source of Hunan Red Tea." In the New Hua Red Tea Pavilion, a Fujian tea merchant took a liking to a high-mountain tea called "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order. Wang Zhun, the secretary-general of the provincial tea industry association, said happily that the current pandemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the perspective of the tea expo, there are numerous highlights. The appearance of New Hua Red Tea has injected profound cultural connotations into tea culture. With strong popularity and booming transactions, the Hunan tea industry is welcoming a new spring.
