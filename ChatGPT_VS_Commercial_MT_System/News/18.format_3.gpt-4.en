Chongqing Vocational Schools Pilot Modern Apprenticeship System: Enrollment Means Becoming a Prospective Employee of the Enterprise - Xinhua News Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent cultivation model in 60 vocational schools. Students who participate in the pilot program will have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-hired as employees by the pilot enterprises. The Municipal Education Commission requires standardized enrollment and employment procedures for vocational schools and enterprises, clarifying the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and prospective enterprise employees. According to the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, schools, and enterprises will sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices aged 16 but not yet 18, agreements must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise, specifying the rights and interests of all parties, as well as the specific positions, teaching content, and rights protection for on-the-job training of the apprentice. The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system to jointly carry out pre-job training and job-transfer training with partner enterprises. Pilot schools must reform their talent cultivation models. Schools and enterprises should jointly design talent training programs, and jointly develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans. The pilot will take the training period as one pilot cycle, and the students' internship time in the enterprise will be determined according to the professional talent training program, with a general duration of 6 months for internships. During the enterprise practice, a team-based management model should be implemented. Depending on the characteristics of different professions, one master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices, forming study groups to ensure that students can proficiently master the skills required for each training position. According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will designate 60 municipal-level vocational modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with about 50 participants in each pilot, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained. Following the principle of piloting first and then promoting from point to surface, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improving students' job skills, increasing the employment rate of students in their respective fields, and enhancing the quality of employment.
