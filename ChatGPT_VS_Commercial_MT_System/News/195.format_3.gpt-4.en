Curators from Zhongsha and Saudi Arabia jointly organize the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale - Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12th (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) - The first Saudi Arabian contemporary art biennale, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District, located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other places participated in the exhibition. The biennale was jointly curated by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the Chinese UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, with UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art's director Tian Feiyu serving as the artistic director. According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennale is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones," a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during social and economic transformation, as well as reflecting the current situation of Saudi cultural and social development. The biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones," "Heritage as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art." Among them, works by 27 Saudi artists account for over 40% of the total exhibits, encompassing various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists have also received much attention, with some artists employing innovative methods to create art using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's "Behind the Scenes Series: Endless Landscape Painting" (2014), which restructures a classic landscape painting using discarded materials. Bakkery, the CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, expressed hope that this biennale would establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to gain insight into the thriving cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia and strengthen exchanges and interactions. Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biennale is twofold: it enables Saudi contemporary art to participate in global conversations, and it allows Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art." It is understood that during the opening period of the biennale, a series of lectures will be held, with artists, curators, and creative industry opinion leaders discussing topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.
