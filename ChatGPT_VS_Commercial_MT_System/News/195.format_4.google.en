Tian Yanyu, the chief of the Chinese UCCA UCA Juren Contemporary Art Center, served as the artistic director.	 According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennial exhibition is "Crossing the river with stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Saudi social and cultural development.

Tian Yanyu said: "The goal of the biennial exhibition is dual, which can allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue, but also allow Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world."
