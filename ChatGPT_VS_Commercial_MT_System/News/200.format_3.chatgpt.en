According to relevant responsible personnel from the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, Yunnan currently has a total of 448,300 rural public welfare positions that have been developed, which are used to provide employment for rural populations in need, such as the poverty-stricken labor force, and play an important role in helping poverty-stricken populations achieve increased income through employment, consolidating poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improving various public services in rural areas. The new regulations, jointly issued by seven departments including the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, rural revitalization, and finance, mainly regulate the scope of recruitment, fund management, position development, and position management at the grassroots level. In terms of position development and setup, the new regulations clearly state that the principles of "setting positions based on demand, defining personnel based on positions, dynamic management, and overall control," "who develops, who uses, who is responsible," and "one person, one position, voluntary disclosure, and unified management" shall be followed. The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, examination, publicity, employment, pre-job training and arrangement. In addition, the new regulations also clearly define the specific responsibilities of the main departments for developing rural public welfare positions, the subsidies standards and methods for rural public welfare positions, and stipulate that the departments for developing rural public welfare positions should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the personnel who are assigned to the rural public welfare positions.
