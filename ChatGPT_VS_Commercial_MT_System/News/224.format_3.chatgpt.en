Starry Night Appointment | Gemini Meteor Shower to Experience Maximum on the 14th - Xinhua News Agency, Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy popularization experts introduced that as this year's last large-scale meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, the Gemini Meteor Shower will experience maximum on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the latter half of the night on that day. Beijing Astronomical Enthusiast An Jiu photographed the Gemini Meteor Shower in Qinghai on December 13th, 2018. Most of the parent bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini Meteor Shower is the 3200 Phaethon asteroid, which is an Apollo-type asteroid. The Gemini Meteor Shower is also currently known to be the second meteor shower not "fostered" by a comet. Xiu Lipeng, the director of Tianjin Astronomical Society and a popularization expert in astronomy, introduced that, like a big New Year's film, the Gemini Meteor Shower generally appears at the end of the year, and its "screening schedule" can last from December 4th to 17th. The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow and is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, along with the Quadrantid Meteor Shower and the Aquarius Meteor Shower. A notable characteristic of the Gemini Meteor Shower is that the meteor speed is relatively slow, the color is rich, and there are also many fireballs. It is not only suitable for visual observation, but also for beginners in astronomical photography. Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomical enthusiast, photographed the Gemini Meteor Shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13th, 2020. Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its maximum around 3:00 p.m. on December 14th, and its ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observing conditions when the radiant point is directly overhead) will be 150." Gemini meteor shower recommendation index chart. "Last year, the 'Falling Petals' Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered by moonlight, and the degree of excitement will be discounted. On the 14th, it is the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar, and the phase of the moon is a full moon, which will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the latter half of the night, and at this time, the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher. Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the few hours after the moon sets in the latter half of the night, but be sure to keep warm." How can you observe as many meteors as possible? "Observing in the city is not recommended. Instead, one can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and a clear view towards the northeast in the suburbs or countryside. Then, patiently wait for the moon to set and observe with the naked eye. It's important to note that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is large in all directions, so there's no need to fixate on the radiant point of the shower. For those who enjoy photography, to capture stunning shots of the meteor shower, it's best to use a wide-angle lens with a large aperture. When shooting, use high ISO and the maximum aperture. A tripod, spare batteries, and a cable release are also essential for stability and continuity, as Xiu Li-peng reminded.
