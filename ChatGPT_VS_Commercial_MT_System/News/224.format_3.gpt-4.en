Starry Sky Date | Geminid Meteor Shower Peaks on December 14 - Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomy popularization experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the latter half of the night on that day. A Geminid meteor shower was photographed in Qinghai by Beijing amateur astronomer An Jiu on December 13, 2018. Most meteor showers have periodic comets as their parent bodies, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid. The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "nurtured" by a comet. Tianjin Astronomical Society Council member and astronomy popularization expert Xiu Lipeng explained that, just like a New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year. Its "screening period" lasts from December 4 to December 17. The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the Quadrantids meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower, they are referred to as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere. One notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is the slower speed of the meteors and their rich colors, with many fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and photography by astronomy beginners. A Geminid meteor shower was photographed by Tianjin amateur astronomer Yang Jing in Jizhou, Tianjin, on December 13, 2020. Astronomical forecasts indicate that this year's Geminid meteor shower will peak around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observing conditions when the radiant point is directly overhead) of 150.

"Last year, the 'falling blossoms' of the Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by moonlight, reducing its spectacular level slightly. The 14th is the 11th day of the eleventh lunar month, with a gibbous moon phase, and the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the latter half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will rise relatively high. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it during the few hours after the moon sets in the latter half of the night, but be sure to stay warm and guard against the cold." How can one observe as many meteors as possible? "It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a location in the suburbs or rural areas with high altitude, low light pollution, and a wide view facing the northeast. Then, patiently wait for the moon to set and start visual observation. It is worth noting that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, so there is no need to keep staring at its radiant point during the observation. For photography enthusiasts who want to capture a splendid 'meteor shower blockbuster', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting. Considering stability and sustainability, a tripod, spare batteries, and a shutter release cable are also essential," Xiu Lipeng reminds.
