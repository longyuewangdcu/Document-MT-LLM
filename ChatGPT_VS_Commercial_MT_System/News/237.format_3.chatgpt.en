The Minister of Information and Communications, Nguyen Meng Xiong, stated that despite the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to spread in 2021, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology enterprises still maintained a growth trend of nearly 10%. In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam increased, focusing on resolving major problems facing Vietnam, and many digital products have gone overseas, and the ranking of Vietnam's digital technology has improved. Minister Nguyen Meng Xiong called on digital technology enterprises to take responsibility for developing the national digital transformation platform and that developing these national digital platforms is a national mission. At the forum, leaders from various departments and state agencies, as well as individuals and organizations involved in researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology, shared their efforts and resources to mobilize the whole society to develop Vietnam's technological enterprises and work together to promote the country's digital transformation. They also shared breakthrough ideas and solutions for post-pandemic economic recovery. In his speech, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and a requirement for development. He noted that digital transformation has become a global issue and is for the benefit of all citizens, so it requires the participation of everyone. The people and businesses are the core, main body, goal, and driving force of digital transformation. Therefore, all policies should be designed for the people and businesses. Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasized that the digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit and should be driven by internal forces such as strategy, long-term, and decisive factors, with external forces as important and breakthrough points. He also believes that the digital transformation needs to drive in-depth development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic, the recovery and development of the economy, the response to subsequent changes, and the overcoming of the phenomenon of depletion of natural resources, and help with the green transformation and the development of green energy. The digital transformation needs to participate in the protection and promotion of the establishment of databases related to national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs, and so on, and promote digital transformations in fields such as banking, tax, land management and development, logistics, and others. The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make the people happier and the country increasingly prosperous and developed. Premier Fan Mingzheng requires the government at all levels, various institutions, and enterprises to increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, enhance their understanding of digital transformation, continue to develop and improve the system of digital transformation, and strengthen the state's management and promotion of the development of digital technology enterprises based on the spirit of respect, communication, listening, and proactivity.
