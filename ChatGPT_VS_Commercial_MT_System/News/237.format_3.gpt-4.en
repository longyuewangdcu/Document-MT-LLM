Vietnam People's Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum. During the forum, two main meetings were held, discussing topics revolving around digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, as well as digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung stated that in 2021, despite the ongoing spread of COVID-19, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology enterprises still maintained a growth momentum, reaching nearly 10%. In 2021, the number of typical Vietnamese digital products increased, focusing on addressing major challenges faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone international, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved. Minister Nguyen Manh Hung called on digital technology enterprises to take responsibility for developing the national digital transformation platform and to undertake the mission of developing these national digital platforms as a national mission. At the forum, leaders from various departments and national agencies, as well as enterprises, organizations, and individuals engaged in researching, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology, shared breakthrough ideas and solutions for mobilizing and pooling society's resources to develop Vietnamese technology enterprises, jointly promoting national digital transformation, and post-pandemic economic recovery. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective demand for development. Digital transformation has become a global issue, and it serves the entire population, so it requires the participation of all citizens. The people and enterprises are the core, main body, goal, and driving force of digital transformation. Therefore, all policies should be for the people and enterprises. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh emphasized that digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit and should primarily rely on internal strength as the strategic, long-term, and decisive factor, with external forces playing an important and breakthrough role. At the same time, he believes that digital transformation needs to drive in-depth and sustainable development, participate in COVID-19 prevention and control, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, and overcome the depletion of natural resources, thereby promoting green transformation and the development of green energy. Digital transformation should also be involved in protecting and promoting databases related to national cultural values, historical traditions, and local customs, as well as driving digital transformation in fields such as banking, taxation, land management and development, and logistics. The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the nation increasingly prosperous. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh called on governments at all levels, agencies, and enterprises to strengthen leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, raise awareness of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system of digital transformation, strengthen national management, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises with respect, communication, listening, positivity, and proactivity. During the forum, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attended the 2021 "Made in Vietnam" Outstanding Digital Product Award Ceremony and the opening ceremony of the "Made in Vietnam" Digital Product Exhibition.
