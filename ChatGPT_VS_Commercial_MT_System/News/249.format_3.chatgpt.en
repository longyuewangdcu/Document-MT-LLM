This is the second water-based green comprehensive service zone to be officially operated in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Sichuan was put into operation on the 8th. Thus, the water-based green comprehensive service zones have covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Qu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Management Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces have built and operated 10 water-based green comprehensive service zones in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation. Full coverage of the water-based green comprehensive service zones is another milestone event in the construction of green navigation on the Yangtze River, significantly improving the ability to receive ship pollutants and provide shipping services." According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services to the majority of ships and sailors and helping them solve the "emergency and hope" problem. The two water-based green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been built and put into operation, integrate life services, production services, and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship maintenance and ship emergency rescue services as the characteristics. They realize the "one-time mooring and multiple services" for ships in the port, which will make the work of sailors who are cruising on the Yangtze River more efficient and life more convenient.
