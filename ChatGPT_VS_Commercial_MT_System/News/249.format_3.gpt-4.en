The main stream of the Yangtze River achieves full coverage of waterborne green integrated service areas - Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11th (Reporter Wang Xian) - The Fuling waterborne green integrated service area in Chongqing was completed and put into operation on the 10th as scheduled. This is the second waterborne green integrated service area officially operating in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, following the launch of the Luzhou waterborne green integrated service area in Sichuan Province on the 8th. So far, waterborne green integrated service areas have covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport, introduced that prior to this, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces had already built and operated 10 waterborne green integrated service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. These service areas have been widely recognized by crew members and have played an important role in promoting high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping. The full coverage of waterborne green integrated service areas is another milestone in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, significantly improving the reception of ship pollutants and shipping service capabilities. According to the introduction, the waterborne green integrated service area is an important facility that provides comprehensive production and living services for ships and crew members, helping them solve urgent and difficult problems. The two waterborne green integrated service areas that have been completed and put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate living services, production services, and administrative services, with a focus on environmental protection and featuring ship maintenance and emergency rescue services. By enabling "one-time berthing and multiple services" for ships in the port, the service areas will make the work of crew members who sail on the Yangtze River all year round more efficient and their lives more convenient.
