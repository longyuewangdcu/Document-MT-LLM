South African Doctors: Although the Omics variant of the coronavirus is highly contagious, it mostly causes mild symptoms. Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omics variant of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster. According to the Associated Press, as the Omics variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of KwaZulu-Natal reports that the symptoms of the coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as physical pain and coughing, similar to flu-like symptoms. Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, says he sees several dozen patients every day, but no one has yet needed to be hospitalized. Pillay says, "They are able to control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He says this includes elderly patients and those with health problems who are more likely to develop severe cases if infected with coronavirus. He says that in contrast, during the previous wave of the Delta outbreak, the coronavirus patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels. Many had to be hospitalized within a few days." Within two weeks of the first reported case of the Omics variant in southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences. Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, the observations and early evidence provided by doctors offer some clues. According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, of the COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% are severe cases, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, compared to 20% in South Africa's early outbreaks. The head of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports and said: "Almost all indications now are that this is a milder disease." He also said: "It is still early, and we need to get later data. Typically, hospitalization and death occur later, and we've only been in this wave for two weeks." Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the efficacy of current vaccines and treatments. Despite Delta still being the dominant variant of COVID-19 globally, the cases of the Alpha variant are being reported in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak. According to health officials, the number of new cases discovered in the first week of December in the Western Cape Province increased by 400%. Tests show that the cases of the Alpha variant make up over 90% of the total.
