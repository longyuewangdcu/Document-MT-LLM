South African Doctor: Omicron has strong transmission but mostly mild cases. Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly. According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization comprising more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province reports that the symptoms of COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughs, similar to flu symptoms. Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, says he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization. Pillay says, "They are able to control the disease at home, with most people recovering within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health issues who are more susceptible to severe illness from coronavirus infections. In comparison, he said, during the previous wave of the Delta variant, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days." Within two weeks of the Omicron variant being first reported in southern Africa, other doctors have also shared similar experiences. Although collecting enough data will take several more weeks, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues. According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% have severe symptoms, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, whereas the death rate was 20% in the early outbreak cases in South Africa. Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all signs point to this being a milder disease." He also said, "It is still early, and we need to obtain later data. Typically, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only entered this wave of the pandemic for two weeks." Meanwhile, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments. Although Delta remains the dominant coronavirus strain worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak. According to health officials, the number of new cases found in Gauteng Province increased by 400% during the first week of December, and testing shows that Omicron variant cases account for more than 90% of these cases.
