South African doctors: Omicron spreads strongly but mostly mildly Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the Omicron variant of the New Coronavirus is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly. As the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 physicians in Gauteng Province, South Africa, reported that they are currently treating patients with mild symptoms of the new crown, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu, according to the Associated Press. The group's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients each day, but none have yet required hospitalization. They are able to manage the disease at home, and most recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Pillay said. " This includes older patients and those with health problems that would have been more susceptible to serious illness from coronavirus infection, he said. By contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, the new coronavirus patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels. Many had to be hospitalized within days." Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron mutant strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences. Although it will take several weeks to collect sufficient data, the physicians' observations and early evidence provide some clues. According to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of new coronary patients hospitalized in recent weeks were severely ill, half the proportion of severe cases in the previous outbreak; the average length of hospital stay was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent new coronary patients died, compared to 20% of deaths in earlier outbreaks in South Africa. Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, citing data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, said: "At this point, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease. "He added: "It's still early days, and we need to get late data. Typically, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we're only two weeks into this outbreak. "In the meantime, scientists around the world are looking at the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments. While Delta remains the dominant new coronavirus strain worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the center of the outbreak. According to health officials, Gauteng saw a 400 percent increase in new cases in the first week of December, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 percent of cases.
