South African doctors: Although Omikon has a strong transmission, many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the pathogenic variability of the new crown virus Omikon varieties is relatively milder than Delta, although the spread is faster.	 According to the Associated Press, with the dissemination of Omikon variants in South Africa, a more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa in South Africa formed a doctor's organization that the symptoms of the new crown patients currently treating are relatively mild, such as the body.	 Pain and cough are similar to influenza.	 Dr. UNBEN Pillay, director of the organization, said that he saw dozens of patients every day, but no patient needs to be hospitalized.	 "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days." He said that this includes elderly patients and patients with healthy problems, which are more likely to be infected by coronary virus infections.	 He said that, compared with it, in the previous wave of Delta epidemic, the new crown patients he had treated "had difficulty breathing and blood oxygen levels were low. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days."	 In the first two weeks after the first report of Omiko's mutant strain in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experience.	 Although it takes a few weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observation and early evidence provides some clues. According to the conclusing of the South African State Infectious Disease Research Institute: Only 30%of the new crown patients who are hospitalized in recent weeks are severe illnesses, which is half of the first wave of epidemic.	 Among the patients, there were only 3 % of death, and in the early outbreak of South Africa, the death ratio was 20 %.	 William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health Research, quoted data and other reports from the State Infectious Disease Research Institute: "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a gentle disease." He also	 Said: "It is still early, we need to obtain later data. Usually, the hospitalization and death occur late, and we have only two weeks when we enter this wave of epidemic." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing	 The number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effects of the current vaccine and treatment methods. Although Delta is still the main new crown virus strain in the world, Omikon is in dozens of countries, of which South Africa is an epidemic center.	 According to health officials, the new cases discovered in the first week of Hao Deng in the first week of December increased by 400 %. Tests showed that more than 90 % of the Omikojon variants accounted for more than 90 %.
