The South Africa Doctor:Many doctors and medical experts South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the new crown virus is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster. As the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province, South Africa, reports that they are currently treating patients with mild symptoms, AP reported.Flu-like symptoms such as body aches and coughs. Dr. Unben Pillay, the group's director, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but none have yet needed to be hospitalized. Pillay said:"They were able to control the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of isolation." That includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall seriously ill from coronavirus infection, he said. By contrast, in the last wave of Delta outbreaks, he said, the Covid-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels. Many were hospitalized within days." Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa,Other doctors have shared similar experiences.While it will take several weeks to gather enough data, doctor observations and early evidence offer some clues. According to the South Africa National Institute of Communicable Diseases:Only 30 percent of patients hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave;The average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days;Only 3 percent of recent COVID-19 cases have died, compared with 20 percent in the earlier outbreak in South Africa. Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports:"At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease," he added."It's still early days, and we need to get late-stage data. Usually hospitalizations and deaths happen late, and we're only two weeks into this outbreak." Meanwhile, scientists around the world are looking at case numbers and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments. While Delta remains the dominant strain of the virus worldwide, cases of Omicron are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter. Gauteng saw a 400 percent increase in new cases in the first week of December, with tests showing more than 90 percent of cases of the Omicron variant, according to health officials.
