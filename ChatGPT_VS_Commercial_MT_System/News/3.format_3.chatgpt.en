Students take the lead role and research results spark imagination at Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference - Xinhua News Agency. At the 2016 academic conference of Zhejiang University, a series of mind-blowing academic achievements were honored during the opening ceremony. These achievements were primarily researched by students and covered various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life sciences, and humanistic education. Starting from a curious point, the students created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have already won awards both domestically and internationally. Bio-sensor: Your home medical examiner Doctoral student Zhang Diming of the Biomedical Engineering College of Zhejiang University demonstrated a bio-sensor on a smart phone, which is only half the size of a smart phone. "You just need to gently exhale and this device can preliminary detect your body health status from the composition of the exhaled gas," Zhang Diming introduced. This sensor is connected to a smart phone and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone. The smart wristbands currently available on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse. This bio-sensor utilizes graphene, a new material, as its target and its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status. Smart surgical light: The high-energy eyes of a doctor. In addition to smart phones, intelligent surgical lights have also been used in the operating room. This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Inventors Exhibition this year. Master's students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the College of Photonics and Engineering Sciences opened up new ideas from the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED shadowless surgical light. "Many diseases are detected and cut in an inadequate manner early on, which is related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room." Shen Junfei said that for example, if doctors cannot see all tumor tissue in time during early cancer detection, then cancer cells will spread later on. This intelligent surgical light has four light panels and enhances the distinction of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum. During the operation, the doctor can adjust the light beam size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate according to the surgical needs and personal preferences at any time. This intelligent surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback. Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup. Using air to wash hands: saving water and cool. Common people wash their hands using water, at most using some soap and squeezing out some hand sanitizer. But Li Qi Zhang and his classmates have invented an "air washing device". As long as you stand on the washing device, your weight will compress the air out. "It's like an air pump. The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water. This way, we can clean our hands!" The visible color reaction and bacterial residue experiments demonstrate that this method of washing hands is equally effective as conventional methods. The device only relies on our own gravity as the driving force, it not only ensures cleanliness but also saves 90% of water and is completely energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-renowned universities and received the only gold award.
