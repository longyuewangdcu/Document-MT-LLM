Students sing the lead role at the annual academic conference of Zhejiang University Research results make people brainstorm - Xinhua.com Washing hands with air, judging diseases with a breath, and precisely searching for the source of haze Last night, a series of brainstorming academic results were recognized at the opening ceremony of the 2016 annual academic conference of Zhejiang University. The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers major fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medical, life science, humanities and education, etc. The students started from a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad. Biosensor: your home medical checkup doctor The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a smartphone-side biosensor on site, half the size of a smartphone. "You only need to gently exhale, this set of instruments from the composition of your exhaled gas, the initial detection of physical health . "Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone, and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone. Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions, generally detect the temperature, pulse and other physical parameters. This set of biosensors uses a new material, graphene, whose target is chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the health condition more deeply and accurately. Intelligent surgical light: the doctor's high-powered eyes In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room. The invention won a silver medal at the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year. The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students from the School of Optical Science and Engineering, opened a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp. "Many diseases early detection and removal are not in place, related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room . " said Junfei Shen, for example, when cancer early examination, if the doctor can not see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards. This intelligent surgical light has four light discs that enhance the degree of differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum. During surgery, doctors can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, the spectrum, the color uniformity and the shadow-free rate at any time according to their surgical needs and personal habits. This intelligent surgical light has been tried out in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and received better feedback. Last October, this invention won the first prize of National Challenge Cup. Hand washing with air: water-saving and cool Ordinary people wash their hands is to flush with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device". Just stand on the device's hand washing station, our weight can be compressed out of the air. "It's like a pump. The compressed air, at the faucet to form a fluid, and water combined together. In this way, we can wash our hands clean! " The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove: the effect of hand washing by this method is the same as the ordinary hand washing method. This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the degree of washing and save 90% of water, and the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly. Last year, in the second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention won the only gold medal among many of the world's top schools.
