At the annual conference of the Zhejiang University, the research results of the students' singing protagonists made people open-Xinhuanet used air to wash their hands, and to judge the disease with a breath, precisely searching for the source of the haze yesterday night, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Annual Conference of Zhejiang University, a series	 The academic achievements of brain hole are commended.	 The main researchers of these achievements are students. Studying all major fields such as environmental, machinery, energy, energy, medical care, life sciences, and humanities education. Starts starting from a curious point of ideas, creating many high -end inventions with application value	 Some of these projects have won awards in China.	 Biosensor: Your doctoral student of your family medical examination doctor Zhang Diming team showed a biosensor on the smartphone side on the spot, with only half of the smartphone. "You just need to breathe gently, this set of instruments can be initially detected from the gas composition you exhaled." Zhang Diming said that this sensor is connected to the smart phone. After exhaling the gas, the health report will report.	 Show on the phone.	 Smart bracelets that can detect health status in the market are generally detected physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.	 And this set of biosensor uses a new material such as graphene. Its target is chemical elements. The keen "smell" allows it to deeper and accurately reflect the health status of the body.	 Intelligent surgical light: doctor's high -energy eyes In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.	 The invention won a silver award at the 44th Switzerland Geneva International Invention Exhibition.	 Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei teams of the School of Optoelectronics and Engineering have opened new ideas in the defects of traditional operating lights, and invented the intelligent LED surgery without shadow lamps.	 "Many early detection and removal of the disease are not in place, which is related to the lamps used by the doctor's operating room." Shen Junfei said. For example, during the early examination of cancer, if the doctor could not see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells would spread. This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamps. By adjusting the spectrum, the difference between different organizations under light.	 During the surgery, doctors can adjust the size, lightness, spectrals, color uniformity, and non -permission rate of the light spots according to the needs of surgery and personal habits.	 This intelligent surgical lamp has been tried at the Hospital of Shao Yifu Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College, and a hospitals with Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical College to get better feedback.	 In October last year, the invention won the National Challenge Cup first prize.	 Wash your hands with air: saving water and cool Ordinary people wash their hands with water. At most, wipe some soaps and squeeze some hand -toilets.	 As long as the washing table of the device stands, our weight can compress the air out.	 "It's like a tube. The compressed air forms a fluid on the faucet and combines with water. In this way, we can wash it with our hands!" The color reaction and bacterial residue experiments have proved that the effect of washing hands through this method is the same as ordinary hand washing methods.	 This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driver. It can ensure the degree of washing and save 90%of water. The whole process is completely incurable and energy -saving and environmentally friendly.	 Last year, at the 2nd Global Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many world -famous universities in the world and won the only gold award.
