The 2016 Zhejiang University Annual Conference was held in Shanghai, China. The conference was held in Shanghai, China. The conference was held in Shanghai, China. The conference was held in Shanghai, China. The conference was held in Shanghai.Students started with a curious idea and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad. Biosensors:Zhang Diming, a doctoral student at the School of Biomedical Engineering, your family medical examiner, showed off a smartphone-side biosensor half the size of a smartphone. "You just need to breathe in gently, this set of instruments can detect the health status of the body from the composition of the gas you exhale." Zhang Diming said that the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone. The smart bracelet that can detect health status on the market generally detects physical parameters such as temperature and pulse. The biosensor uses graphene, a new material, and its target is a chemical element.The keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately. Intelligent surgical light:The Doctor's High-Energy Eye In addition to smart phones, the operating room also used smart operating lights. This invention won the silver medal at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year. Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master students of the School of Optoelectronics Science and Engineering, opened new ideas in the defects of traditional operating lights and invented the smart LED operating shadowless lamp.If doctors can't see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer will spread later. This kind of intelligent operating light has four light panels, which can enhance the difference of different tissues under the light by adjusting the spectrum. During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the light spot at any time according to the operation needs and personal habits. This kind of intelligent operating light has been tested in the Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback. Last October,The invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.Hand washing with air:Water saving and cool Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, and Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device". As long as the station on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air out."It's like a pump. The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water. In this way, we can wash our hands clean!" The color reaction and bacterial residue test prove that:The effect of washing hands in this way is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods. This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the degree of washing, and can save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly. Last year, at the Second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention stood out from many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.
