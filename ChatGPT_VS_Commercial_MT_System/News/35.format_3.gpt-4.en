Education Commentary: What does it take to rescue abducted children? If we analogize the famous public service advertisement slogan "No trade, no killing," then in a good environment without the demand for "child abduction," we need to rely on collective prevention and treatment, and a nationwide fight against abduction to make the act of abduction unprofitable, risky, and costly, thereby preventing such crimes from happening repeatedly. Recently, the Child Abduction Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency platform for missing children information. This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and to promptly recover abducted children. Upon hearing that this app is called "Reunion," one immediately feels a sense of warmth. The new technological means not only have a "literary" name and are full of emotions, but they also make proper use of information technology, making them practical and effective. In combating child abduction, the primary goal is to find the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom. The trial and punishment of the suspects come only after that. The significance of criminal punishment can range from individual punishment, social prevention, to legal education, and many "big words" can be listed. However, before the abduction case is solved, the personal safety of the victims should be given priority. It is essential to prioritize matters based on their importance and urgency. Under the urgent goal of "searching and rescuing," controversial topics like "whether child traffickers should be sentenced to death without exception" can be temporarily set aside for cautious discussion; however, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait. According to the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers tend to quickly leave the crime scene after succeeding. Each minute the search for abducted children is delayed, the further they may be from their parents, and the more difficult it becomes to solve the case. In this situation, implementing effective measures like the "Reunion" platform that directly help solve cases and recover children is indeed a pragmatic action. After all, combating child abduction requires the entire legal system to work together to accomplish this significant task. Combating crime and safeguarding the rights and interests of children and their parents require improvements in legislation, judicial protection, and meticulous law enforcement, all of which must embody the care for the "protection of the young and the weak." Furthermore, the prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family to society. For example, in a common case, a family of three rests at a train station, and the parents fall asleep only to wake up and find their child missing. One cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a strong sense of protection. Parents taking turns resting, or placing the child in a secure environment, are the most basic measures to prevent child abduction. From another perspective of the police's efforts to combat child trafficking, the buyers of abducted children should also be subject to attention and punishment. An individual unlawful act is often just one link in a long chain. According to China's Criminal Law, the statutory punishment for child trafficking starts at five years in prison; in particularly severe cases, the penalty can be as severe as the death sentence and confiscation of property. With a high starting point and the heaviest penalty, child trafficking is obviously considered a more severe crime amidst the general trend of lighter penalties. However, a considerable number of trafficking cases still occur every year. This shows that some people have outdated concepts when it comes to raising children and a weak awareness of the law. Legal education for these individuals should be carried out simultaneously. To effectively control child trafficking crimes, it is not enough to rely solely on strict law enforcement by the authorities. If there is a widespread "market" for child abduction, traffickers will be blinded by their greed, constantly innovating their trafficking methods, and engaging in a "battle of wits" with law enforcers, making anti-abduction efforts inevitably fall into inefficient quagmires. Therefore, eliminating outdated ideas and popularizing legal knowledge also contribute to eradicating child trafficking and purchasing crimes.
