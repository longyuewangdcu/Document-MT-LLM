Education Commentary: What does it take to save an abducted child? If analogous to the famous public service announcement "no sale, no kill", then, in a good environment without the need to "collect abduction", group prevention and anti-trafficking, so that abduction and trafficking is not profitable, risky and costly, this type of crime will not repeatedly The actual fact is that the actual fact is that the particulars of the actuals are not the same as the actuals of the actuals. Recently, the Ministry of Public Security Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Office of the fight against trafficking in children developed the emergency release platform for missing children information online. This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing child information and the timely recovery of abducted children. Hearing that the app is called "Reunion", I feel warm and fuzzy. New technology means not only the name "literary", full of emotion, and the proper use of information technology, practical, effective. The primary goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to find the abducted child and protect his personal safety and freedom. The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect. The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many "big words". However, before an abduction case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim. The matter is divided into priorities, in the urgent "rescue" purpose, such as "whether child trafficking should be all death penalty" and other controversial topics, can be set aside, cautious discussion; but the rescue of abducted children can not wait. According to the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are used to get away from the place of crime as soon as possible after getting their hands on them. The search for the abduction operation is delayed for one more minute, the child may be one step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one. In this case, come up with such as "reunion" platform directly help to solve the case, to find the child effective way, is indeed a pragmatic action. After all, the "fight against abduction" is a big task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do a good job. To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to judicial protection, as well as the meticulous enforcement of the law, all need to implement the "protection of the young and the weak" care. In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can do better. For example, a common case, a family of three resting in a train station, the parents asleep, only to wake up to find the child missing. A two-year-old child cannot be expected to have adequate self-protection skills, but as the parents of a young child, should have at least a fair sense of protection. Two parents taking turns to rest, or put the child under secure protection, are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted. From the other side of the police fight against abduction and trafficking crimes, the party that buys abducted children should also be concerned and punished. A single wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain. According to China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of child abduction and sale starts at five years; in particularly serious cases, it can be up to the death penalty and confiscation of property. The starting point is high, the maximum penalty is heavy, in the general trend of "lightening", the crime of child abduction and sale is obviously a heavier punishment of crime. However, there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking that occur every year. It is evident that some people are backward in the concept of raising children and have little awareness of the law. Legal education for this part of the population should be followed up simultaneously. To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, we cannot rely only on strict official law enforcement. If the abduction "market" is widespread, the traffickers lust for profit, constantly innovate the means of abduction, the formation of "fighting" situation with law enforcement, the anti-trafficking action is bound to fall into the quagmire of inefficiency. Therefore, to break the backward concept, the popularization of common sense of the law, but also to help eradicate the crime of trafficking and buying children.
