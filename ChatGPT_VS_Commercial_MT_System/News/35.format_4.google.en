Education comments: What should I rely on to save the abducted children?	 If the famous public welfare slogan "without buying and selling without buying and selling", then, in a good environment without the needs of "receiving turns", group defense and the whole people have turned the whole people.	 High, this kind of crime will not occur repeatedly.	 Recently, the children's missing information developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.	 This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of children's missing information and timely retrieve the abducted children.	 I heard that this app is called "reunion", and he feels warm. The new technical means are not only "literary and artistic", full of feelings, but also well -used use, practical and effective.	 The primary goal of abducting law enforcement is to retrieve the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.	 The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect.	 The significance of criminal punishment can list many "big words" from individual punishment and social prevention to legal education.	 However, before the case of trafficking cases, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim. Under the purpose of urgent "rescue", there are divergent and controversial topics such as "whether or not children should be sentenced to death."	 No.	 According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers are used to stay away from the place of crime as soon as possible after they succeed.	 After a more than a minute of abduction operation, the child may be far away from the parents, and the difficulty of the investigation of the case will increase by one point.	 In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to bring out an effective way to help detect cases and recover children in children like a "reunion" platform.	 After all, "abduction" is a big task that needs to operate the entire legal system to do well. Based on crimes, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of judicialness, and the meticulous law enforcement, no need to implement the care of "protecting the young and supporting the weak".	 In addition, the prevention of children can do better from family to society.	 For example, a common case, a family of three resting at the train station, his parents fell asleep, and woke up to find that the child was gone.	 Can't expect a two -year -old child to have sufficient self -protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should have at least a considerable sense of protection.	 Both parents take turns to rest, or under the safe protection of their children, are the minimum means to prevent children's abduction. From the other side of the police's crackdown on the crime, buying the abducted children should also be followed and punished.	 A single illegal behavior is often only one of the long chains.	 According to the provisions of the Criminal Law in my country, the legal punishment point for trafficking for children is 5 years; if the circumstances are particularly serious, they can be sentenced to death and confiscated property.	 The prison point is high and the highest sentence is in the general trend of "minorization", and the crime of trafficking for children is obviously a serious crime of punishment.	 There are still many trafficking cases every year. It can be seen that some people have a backward idea of raising their children and weak legal awareness.	 The legal education of these people should follow up simultaneously.	 To effectively control the trafficking crime, we must not rely on the official strict law enforcement.	 If the "market" is widely existed, the trafficking of the traffickions will continue to innovate the means of trading, forming a "fighting method" situation with law enforcers.	 Therefore, breaking the concept of backwardness and the popularization of legal knowledge, it also helps to cure traffic and buy children's crimes.
