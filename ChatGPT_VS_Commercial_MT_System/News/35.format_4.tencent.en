Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children? If we compare the famous public service slogan "No sale, no killing", then, in a good environment where there is no demand for "trafficking", mass prevention and mass governance, and the whole people's anti-trafficking will make trafficking unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will not occur frequently. Recently, the Ministry of Public Security's Criminal Investigation Bureau's Anti-Trafficking Office developed an emergency information release platform for missing children. This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and to find abducted children in a timely manner. I heard that this App is called" Reunion", and I immediately felt warm. The new technology means not only the name "literature", full of feelings, but also the proper use of information technology, practical and effective. The primary goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to find the abducted child and protect his personal safety and freedom. The second is the trial and punishment of the suspect. The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can list a lot of "big words". But before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victim. In order of urgency, under the urgent purpose of "seeking rescue", such as "whether abduction and trafficking of children should be sentenced to death" and other controversial topics, can be temporarily put aside and discussed carefully;However, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait. According to the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickers are used to staying away from the crime site as soon as possible after they succeed. If the abduction operation is delayed for another minute, the child may be further away from the parents, and the difficulty of detecting the case will increase. Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with an effective way such as the "reunion" platform that directly helps to detect the case and find the child. After all,"Cracking down on abduction" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system. To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and their parents, from the perfection of legislation, to the guarantee of justice, and the meticulous enforcement of laws, there is no need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak." In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can be done better. For example, a common case, a family of three rest at the railway station, parents sleep, wake up to find that the child is missing. We cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills.However, as parents of young children, they should at least have a considerable sense of protection. Parents taking turns to rest or placing their children under safe protection are the minimum means to prevent child abduction. From the other side of the police's fight against trafficking, the party buying the abducted child should also be concerned and punished. A single illegal act is often only one link in a long chain. According to China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of child trafficking is 5 years;If the circumstances are particularly serious, the penalty may be death and confiscation of property. The starting point is high and the maximum penalty is heavy. Under the general trend of "light punishment", the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with heavier punishment. But there are still many cases of abduction and trafficking every year. It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and weak legal awareness. Legal education for this group of people should be followed up simultaneously. To effectively control the crime of trafficking, we cannot rely solely on the strict enforcement of the law by the authorities. If the "market" of trafficking is widespread, the traffickers are blinded by greed, constantly innovating the means of trafficking, and forming a "battle" situation with law enforcers, the anti-trafficking action is bound to fall into the mud of inefficiency. Therefore, breaking backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help eradicate trafficking.Buying a child.
