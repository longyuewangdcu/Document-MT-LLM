The Democracy Summit comes to a close, and Biden declares that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished. The Summit for Democracy, which was convened by US President Biden and attended by government and civic society leaders from 110 countries as well as private sector leaders, came to a close on Friday, December 10th. In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it. He also announced plans to host the second Global Summit for Democracy next year. Representatives from the Taiwan government and Tang Feng, as well as pro-democracy activist Nathan Law who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the following day. Biden said, "We know the work that lies ahead of us is formidable, but we also know that we can meet the challenge because, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere. Authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish the embers of freedom, which burn in the hearts of people all over the world." Biden also stated that defending democracy requires a collective effort from society as a whole. He said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, drive reforms, achieve transparent accountability, and fortify the forces that buffer and withstand the impacts of authoritarianism, as well as those who nakedly pursue power ahead of the public interest." "The second day of the Democracy Summit" had the themes of defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values. This day coincided with "International Human Rights Day". In his opening speech on that day, UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres also stated that the democratic cause is facing challenges globally, especially those brought by the emerging digital technologies. He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our common values and positions, and the resilience of democracy. This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls." This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution." Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, Law Kwun-Chung, delivered a speech to the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of Chinese minority ethnic groups such as Hong Kong and the Uyghurs and Tibetans. He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise but has not established a mechanism for accountability. This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together. We must use all (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority." Lo Kong-chung also called for the free world to come together to combat the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party. He said: "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, perhaps some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you don't realize the threat the Chinese Communist Party poses to our democratic values. This is why we fail, and this is why we must change." Taiwan Executive Yuan official Tang Feng, in attendance at a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," delivered a video message and issued a "National Statement," emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against tyranny and authoritarianism. He also shared his experience in combating the COVID-19 pandemic through transparency and building mutual trust. He said, "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we remain steadfast in our commitment to leading the global fight against authoritarianism and promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights worldwide. During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have used the guise of public health and collective interest to justify violating human rights, resulting in a regression of global democracy. In Taiwan, however, we were able to control the pandemic without a lockdown and defeat false information without censorship." The same day of the "Democracy Summit," the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from countries such as China and North Korea, which were deemed to have serious human rights violations, and also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to assist in violating human rights.
