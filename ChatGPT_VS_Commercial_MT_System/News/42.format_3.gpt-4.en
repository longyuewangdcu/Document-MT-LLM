The Summit for Democracy concludes, Biden says the flame of freedom will never be extinguished. The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by US President Biden and attended by government representatives from 110 countries, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, came to a close on Friday (December 10th). In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it. He also announced plans to hold the second Global "Summit for Democracy" next year. Taiwan government representative and Minister Tang Feng, along with exiled Hong Kong pro-democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law, currently residing in the UK, also spoke on the second day of the summit. Biden said, "We know how daunting the task before us is. But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I have said before and as this summit demonstrates, democracy is everywhere. Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the faintest spark of freedom; it burns in the hearts of people all around the world and across the globe." Biden also emphasized that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society. He said, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, drive reforms, implement transparent and accountable governance, and better withstand the buffering and impact of authoritarian forces, as well as those who shamelessly pursue power before the public interest." The themes for the second day of the "Summit for Democracy" were defending human rights, strengthening democracy and countering authoritarianism, and combating digital authoritarianism while affirming democratic values. This day coincided with "International Human Rights Day." United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres also said in his opening remarks that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies. He said, "Now is the time to reaffirm our common values and positions, as well as the resilience of democracy. This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls." This also requires resolutely condemning all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution." Hong Kong pro-democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law delivered a speech to the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue paying attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China, such as Uyghurs and Tibetans. He said, "For a long time, the world has been witnessing the rise of China, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable. This is why political figures and civil society leaders must work together. We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority." Nathan Law also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. He said, "Perhaps some of you are afraid to offend General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you haven't realized the threat (the Chinese Communist Party) poses to our democratic values. That is the reason for our failure. That is also the reason we must change." Taiwan's Minister Tang Feng participated in a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values" and released a "National Statement" via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and totalitarianism. He also shared Taiwan's experience in combating the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building trust. He said, "As Taiwan's democracy continues to flourish, we remain firmly committed to standing at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, playing a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights. During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, leading to a global regression in democracy. However, in Taiwan, we were able to control the outbreak without lockdowns and combat misinformation without taking down content." As the second day of the "Summit for Democracy" proceeded, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were deemed to have committed serious human rights abuses. At the same time, investment restrictions were imposed on a Chinese company accused of using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
