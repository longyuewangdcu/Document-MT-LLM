Biden says fire of freedom will never be extinguished The online "Summit for Democracy" (Summit), convened by President Joe Biden and attended by leaders from 110 governments, civil society and the private sector around the world, ended Friday (Dec. 10). In his closing remarks, Biden said the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and can never be extinguished by authoritarian regimes. He also said he plans to hold a second global "Democracy Summit" next year. Taiwan government representative and Councillor Tang Feng and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Kwun Chung, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the second day of the summit. Biden said: "We know the enormity of the work that lies ahead of us. But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I've said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere in the world. Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom that burns in the hearts of people around the world and around the world . "Biden also said that defending democracy requires a concerted effort by the entire community. He said: " As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to reinforce the parapets of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, and to be more resistant to the buffers and shocks of tyranny and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good . " "The themes of the second day of the Democracy Summit were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values. The day coincided with International Human Rights Day. In his opening remarks, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially from emerging digital technologies. It is time to reaffirm common values and positions and the resilience of democracy," he said. This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls. This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution . "In a pre-recorded video address to the summit, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Lo Kwun Chung reminded participants of the ongoing concern about the human rights situation in Hong Kong and for China's ethnic minorities, including the Uighurs and Tibetans. For too long, the world has accepted the rise of China without a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said. That's why politicians and civil society leaders must work together. We must use all the (resources) we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. " Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. He said, "Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat [the CCP] poses to our democratic values. And that's why we're failing. And that's why we have to change . "In a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," Taiwanese Executive Yuan Councilor Tang Feng issued a national statement via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and power. He also shared his experience on how to fight the new epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust. At a time when democracy is still emerging in Taiwan, we have been at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said. During the epidemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights abuses in the name of public health and the collective good, and global democracy showed signs of regression. In Taiwan, however, we don't have to seal off the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down information to overcome disinformation. "As the second day of the Democracy Summit got underway, the U.S. Treasury Department announced the imposition of legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, found to have committed serious human rights abuses, and on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to facilitate human rights abuses. investment restrictions.
