He added that defending democracy requires the work of an entire society."As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, to push for reform, to achieve transparent and accountable governance, to be more resistant to the forces of authoritarian buffers and shocks, and to those who want to pursue power naked before the public good." The theme of the second day of the Democracy Summit is to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and confront authoritarianism, and counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values. The day coincides with International Human Rights Day. In his opening remarks on the day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy faces challenges around the world, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies. He said:"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience. This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls. This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution."Speaking to the summit via a pre-recorded video, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Roger Law reminded participants of the ongoing human rights situation in Hong Kong and China 's ethnic minorities, including Uighurs and Tibetans."For too long, the world has accepted China 's rise without creating a mechanism to hold it accountable. That' s why politicians and civil society leaders must work together. We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority." Mr. Law also called on the free world to unite against the CCP threat. He said:"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the China market, maybe some of you don't recognize it.The threat to our democratic values. And that's why we failed. That's why we have to change."Tang Feng, a member of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, emphasized that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against autocracy and authoritarianism in a video release of the" National Statement "during a roundtable discussion on" Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values." He also shared his experience on how to fight the new crown epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust. He said:"While Taiwan's democracy is in the ascendant, we remain firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights. During the epidemic, authoritarian governments everywhere justified human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of regression. In Taiwan, however, we did not have to close down the city to contain the epidemic.The United States Treasury Department announced that it would impose sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in China, North Korea and other countries found to have seriously violated human rights, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
