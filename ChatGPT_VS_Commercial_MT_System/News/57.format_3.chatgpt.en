Jiangxi Province plans to train 10,000 rural primary school music, art, and physical education teachers within three years. This initiative was launched in 2016 in order to enhance the ability to secure a shortage of subject teachers and to achieve balanced development of rural compulsory education. The training targets teachers who are under 45 years old and have a knowledge base or talent in music, art, and physical education, and who are able to teach these subjects in addition to their main subject. The training will enable them to master the basic knowledge and teaching skills in music, art, and physical education, update their teaching ideas and concepts, and improve their teaching ability, ability to design activities, campus cultural ability, and self-development ability. This will build a team of music, art, and physical education teachers with multiple capabilities and alleviate the shortage of such teachers in rural areas. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi also plans to train one music, art, and physical education teacher from each of the 100 counties (cities, districts) in the province, for a total of 300 training participants, to comprehensively improve their ability to lead teaching demonstrations, organize research and teaching activities, conduct training, and build online research workshops. They will play the role of teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.
