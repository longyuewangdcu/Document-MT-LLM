Girl becomes human target to raise funds for her sister: "Thinking it's just a flesh wound makes it bearable" - Xinhua News In Hangzhou Wulin Square, a girl stands in front of a large wooden board that reads "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow." Yesterday morning, a photo of the "Hangzhou girl willingly becoming an 'arrow target' to raise funds for her sister" went viral in friends' circles. The photo shows the girl standing in front of a large wooden board, slightly taller than her, with the words "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it. Passers-by are invited to pay and use a bow and arrow to shoot at her. This act has sparked heated discussions among netizens. Last night, the person in charge of publicity for the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Xiacheng Branch confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed the girl took such an extreme action to raise funds for her sister. However, they emphasized that such behavior is not encouraged. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday. The girl's street "arrow target" fundraising was cautioned, and the photo circulated online shows a long-haired girl standing in a "T" shape in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow" written in black ink. In front of her, another board displays her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay account information. The photo has sparked controversy online. Some netizens believe that the act is a "begging behavior aimed at attracting attention," while many others express sympathy for the girl. "We discovered the situation around 10 a.m. on the 23rd when we were patrolling near the square, and there were already quite a few onlookers at the time," said a police officer from the nearby Tianshui Police Station during an interview with local media. There were two girls at the stall, both around 20 years old, dressed youthfully and beautifully. The girl acting as the "human target" was crying, asking passers-by to play the game, while the other girl helped promote the cause by explaining that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, asking for everyone's help. "We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment," said the person in charge of publicity for the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Xiacheng Branch last night, telling the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Ji Jiali, and she was raising funds for her sister Ji Jiayan. However, as the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan in funds, the girl couldn't think of a better way to raise money, which led to her taking such an action. Throughout the process, one girl acted as the target while the other assisted, but neither of them actually participated in shooting arrows. No one was seen shooting arrows during the entire event; people only gathered to watch and take photos to post on Weibo. Later, the police determined through the public security department that the bow and arrow used did not fall under any controlled categories. The person in charge said, "We do not encourage fundraising in this attention-seeking manner." After being warned by the police at the station, the girl left the premises.
