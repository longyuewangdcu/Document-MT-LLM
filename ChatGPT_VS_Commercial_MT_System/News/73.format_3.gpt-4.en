Jie Xin advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website. This year's "Double Eleven" shopping festival saw a nationwide online payment transaction amount reaching 1.77 trillion yuan, setting a new record compared to previous years. With a variety of discount coupons and eye-catching live-streamed sales events, consumers once again shouted for joy at their gains. This consumption boom, on the one hand, makes people marvel at the increasingly strong national spending power, and on the other hand, forces us to calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream contemporary consumer groups. On the eve of "Double Twelve", Jie Xin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jie Xin") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and habits, and to refuse blind and excessive consumption. According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019. Overall, residents in China perform well in terms of financial consumption, but there are significant differences in various aspects of financial behavior and skills, and further improvement in basic financial knowledge is needed. The financial literacy levels of the elderly and young people are relatively low, and "the old and the young" will still be the key focus of ongoing financial education. The "Report on the Debt Status of Chinese Young People" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them have no accumulated debt, and although the younger generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, which is quite different from the label of "excessive extravagance" attached by the outside world, some young people do indeed have excessive and follow-the-trend consumption behaviors, resulting in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even leading to a gradual increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave in taking social responsibility and providing positive guidance. As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jie Xin has always been committed to helping people build their happy lives with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to regulatory calls to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially the younger generation. In the past several years, Jie Xin has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for youth groups, including college students, and through cooperation with top domestic universities, has launched innovative practice competitions and other forms to subtly guide the consumption needs of young people, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, reasonably plan consumption needs, and thus accumulate wealth in their lives. On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jie Xin reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct concept of money, resist blind and excessive consumption, avoid the pitfalls of consumption lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life. When consuming, be sure to plan ahead, spend within your means, and repay on time. If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in your personal credit report, which may have an adverse impact on future economic activities such as buying a car or a house. At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to verifying whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate. In the future, Jie Xin will continue to rely on its mature, reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products to bring consumers more tailored and diversified services, continuously helping the public improve their financial knowledge, cultivating the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a lifelong, trustworthy consumer finance partner for consumers.
