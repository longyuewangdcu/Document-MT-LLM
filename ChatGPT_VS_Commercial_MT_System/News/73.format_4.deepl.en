Jebsen advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double 12" - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website This year's "Double 11" carnival reached 1.77 trillion yuan in national online payment transactions, a record high compared to previous years. A new high. On the one hand, people sighed at the increasingly strong national consumption power, and on the other hand, they had to calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups. On the eve of the "Double 12", Gitzo Consumer Finance Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Gitzo") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and refuse to blindly consume and over-consume. According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019. Overall, China's residents are performing well at the financial consumption level, but there is a wide variation in financial behavior and skills, and there is a need to further improve basic financial knowledge. The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen's "China Youth Debt Status Report" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, although the younger generation shows an overall trend of rational consumption, although it is very different from the label of "excessive spending", some young people do have excessive consumption, follow the trend of consumption behavior, and therefore This has led to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even increased social problems. As a licensed consumer financial institution, Gitzo has always been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and caring services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to raise consumers' awareness of rational consumption, especially among young people. Over the past years, Gitzo has been carrying out comprehensive and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has been working with top universities in China to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms to guide young people's consumption needs, helping them to establish rational consumption concepts and plan their consumption needs rationally, thus helping them to accumulate wealth in life. On the occasion of the 12th of February, Gitzo reminds all consumers to set up a reasonable consumption awareness and correct money concept, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid the misconceptions of consumption and lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life. Be sure to plan ahead when spending, and pay on time within your means. If you are late, the overdue record will be recorded in your credit report, which may have a negative impact on your economic life such as buying a car or a house in the future. At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications. In the future, Gitzo will continue to bring more tailored and diversified services to consumers with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated and iterated financial products, helping consumers to improve their financial knowledge and cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, so as to be a lifelong and reliable consumer finance partner for consumers.
