Vietnam People's Daily Online - Gulf Cooperation Council addresses common challenges; Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait. Notably, this is the first visit to Qatar by the Crown Prince since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis. In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a full blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran. The diplomatic tensions severely affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region. The four Arab countries blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar. The crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January 2021, when the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait, aimed at "unity and stability." Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in the country. The Gulf Arab states' resolution of differences and restoration of relations with Qatar stem from the need for unity in the interest of all countries and regional stability, aimed at addressing common challenges. During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors. The 725-kilometer-long route connecting the two countries will provide convenience for the citizens' travel and integration of supply chains. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' enterprises have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion. The Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincides with negotiations between Iran and major world powers to save the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement criticized by the Gulf Arab states for not addressing Iran's missile issues. The Gulf countries have long viewed Iran as a "competitor" and considered Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security. The Gulf countries believe that not addressing Iran's missile issues and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed. Against the backdrop of major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to satisfy the Gulf countries' desires, Saudi Arabia has held direct talks with Iran. The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region, which is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first since the resolution of disputes between some member countries and Qatar. This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the Council's unity, while proposing measures to enable its member countries to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.
