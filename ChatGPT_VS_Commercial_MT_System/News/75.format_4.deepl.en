vietnampeople.com - GCC tackles common challenges Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait. Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on the country in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis. During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups while having close ties with Iran. Diplomatic tensions have severely affected the internal unity of the GCC and negatively impacted the economies of the countries in the region. Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar. The crisis was resolved only at the January 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council summit, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait. Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in both countries. The Gulf Arab states are resolving their differences to restore relations with Qatar out of a demand to unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, and to address common challenges. During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors. The 725-kilometer link between the two countries will facilitate travel and integrate supply chains for citizens of both countries. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from both countries signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion. The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincides with negotiations between Iran and world powers to salvage the Iranian nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal that Gulf Arab states have condemned as failing to resolve the missile issue with Iran. Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a longtime "competitor" and see its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security. The Gulf states believe that failure to address the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iranian activities in the region is flawed. Against the backdrop of the failure of the nuclear talks between the major powers and Iran to meet the wishes of the various Gulf states, Saudi Arabia entered into direct negotiations with Iran. The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region. This is one of the factors slowing economic growth in the GCC countries. The upcoming GCC summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar. This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures that will enable its member states to cooperate fully to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.
