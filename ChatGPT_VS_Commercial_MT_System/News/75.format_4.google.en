Vietnam People's Daily -Gulf Cooperation Committee responded to the joint challenge of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Ben Salman's stay stations including Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Barin, and Kuwait.	 It is worth noting that this is the first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies on Qatar in mid -2017, which led to the first visit to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis.	 In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Barin, and Egypt broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar and implemented a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar for supporting terrorist organizations, and had close relationships with Iran.	 Foreign tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the Haihe Association and had a negative impact on the economy of the region. Four Arab countries have blocked the land, sea and air route to Qatar.	 The crisis was resolved at the Bay Cooperation Committee Summit in January 2021. The countries of the Gulf signed an agreement from the United States and Kuwait to "unity and stability".	 Saudi Arabia re -open the border with Qatar.	 Saudi Arabia and Egypt are appointing the new ambassador to recover the relationship with Qatar through the two countries in Qatar.	 The Gulf Arab country resolves differences. In order to restore the relationship with Qatar, it must be united in the interests of the interests and regional stability of various countries. It aims to deal with common challenges. During the visit to Oman this time, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land channel between two bay neighbors.	 The channel connecting the 725 kilometers of the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel and integrated supply chain of citizens of the two countries.	 The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $ 5 billion in Oman, and companies between the two countries have signed a memorandum of understanding of 130 billion US dollars.	 The Trip of Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf country coincides with Iran and the world's major countries to save the Iranian nuclear agreement entitled "Joint and Comprehensive Action Plan" (JCPOA) -a Gulf Arab country condemned	 The agreement negotiates.	 Each Gulf country has always regarded Iran as a long -term "competitors" and Iran's nuclear plan as a "threat" for regional security. Each Gulf country believes that it is defective that it does not solve the problem of Iranian missiles and does not take action to curb Iranian activities in the region.	 In the context of negotiations between major countries and Iran's nuclear, Saudi Arabia and Iran negotiated directly.	 Its goal is to curb the upgrade of tensions in the area.	 This is one of the factors that slow down the national economic growth of the Bay Cooperation Committee.	 The upcoming Haihe Club Summit will be the first summit from the Haihe Association State since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar. This is the opportunity to re -evaluate the diplomatic achievements that promote the restoration of the uniform contribution of the sea in the Bay Cooperation Committee. At the same time, various measures are proposed to fully cooperate with their member states to deal with common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf country.
