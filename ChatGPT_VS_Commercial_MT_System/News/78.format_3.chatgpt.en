"Resonating the spirit of the university with the spirit of the times" - The so-called spirit of the university referred to by Xinhua News Agency refers to a series of educational ideas and value pursuits that have been accumulated in the development process of a university, and is the soul of the university. From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been of crucial importance for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society and even the progress of a nation. From the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, their spirit arises from the national crisis and is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating virtue for the benefit of society, and rectifying and ruling with order" and the patriotic responsibility of "cultivating learning for the strengthening of the country." Currently, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and the competition in education, science and technology, and talent around the world is continuously intensifying. As an important "supply-side," the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges. Especially with the proposal of "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines", while showing the confidence and determination of China's progress from a high-education-developed country to a high-education-strong country, it also imposes higher and more updated requirements for university development. How to strive to be a world-class university in a shorter time and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and disciplines with still certain gaps, and achieve the goal of "overtaking on a curve"? In addition to firm goals, path and capability confidence, universities should fully utilize three advantages: one is the advantage of being a late-comer, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, to achieve significant improvement in academic level and management quality; two is the advantage of culture, by inheriting the wisdom and connotations accumulated in 5,000 years of Chinese civilization, promoting the development of excellent traditional cultures, in order to consolidate strength, shape brand image, and enhance image; three is the advantage of the system, by utilizing the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and strength, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantee for universities to accelerate overtaking the advanced level of the world. It should be especially noted that building world-class universities cannot be the same for all schools, and each school must show individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its advantages. School management features should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect each unique target positioning, management traditions, and resource endowments. As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three distinctive features in our education: Firstly, we highlight the training of innovative and entrepreneurial talent, building a integrated educational environment that integrates science and technology with university-enterprise cooperation, and forming a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem. Secondly, we highlight the convergence of interdisciplinary subjects, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the subject system, creating a system environment for interdisciplinary subjects, and actively cultivating emerging interdisciplinary subjects and representative interdisciplinary achievements. Thirdly, we emphasize the characteristic of the educational system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang production-research-cooperation system. In this process, it is particularly important to always uphold the spirit of the university, allowing the spirit of the university to resonate with the spirit of the times. For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation," the common values of "Diligence, Virtuousness, Discernment, and Practicality," and the common expression of "Embracing Rivers, Cultivating Virtues, Benefit Society, and Benefit the Nation" constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit. This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct educational direction and continuously accumulate cultural height and consolidate spiritual strength, with rich connotations and far-reaching significance. Among them, "Embracing Rivers" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the vision of "Making Use of Talent from All Over the World," demonstrating the idea of learning from the world's top universities in education and training. "Cultivating Virtues" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and excellence, meaning that the university should cultivate morality and personality while pursuing truth. "Benefit Society" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of knowledge and scientific research innovation, as well as reform and development, and innovation. "Benefit the Nation" emphasizes patriotic dedication and means that the university should always share the same glory and disgrace with the national fate. This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is exactly where the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education lies. "The wise listen in silence and the intelligent see in the invisible." As China's universities further anchor themselves in the overall national goal of socialism with Chinese characteristics, they must deeply grasp the historical mission they shoulder in the era of higher education and accelerate their efforts to become world-class universities. At the same time, they must uphold humanistic concern and independence, allowing the university spirit to be stimulated by the spirit of the times and the national spirit, thereby providing an endless source of energy for achieving national prosperity, revitalization of the nation, and realizing the common ideal of humanity.
