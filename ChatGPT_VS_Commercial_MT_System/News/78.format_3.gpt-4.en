"Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times" - Xinhua News The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits that a university forms and accumulates over the long term in its development process. It is the soul of the university. From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation. Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission that is different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which emerged during a time of national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the values of "cultivating virtues to benefit the world, and achieving harmony and peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "promoting education to strengthen the nation." Currently, the trends of informatization and internationalization in higher education are becoming increasingly evident. The global competition in education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying. As an important "supply side" of higher education, its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges. The introduction of the "Overall Plan for Coordinating and Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to advance from a higher education powerhouse to a strong higher education nation but also puts forward higher and updated requirements for university development. How can we strive to join the ranks of world-class institutions in a short period, accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on a foundation where there is still a certain gap, and achieve "overtaking on a curve"? In addition to maintaining confidence in our goals, pathways, and capabilities, universities should fully leverage three advantages: The latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning from and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities to achieve significant improvements in academic standards and the quality of education; The cultural advantage, by inheriting the wisdom accumulated in the 5,000 years of Chinese civilization, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture to unite strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; The institutional advantage, by capitalizing on the superiority of the socialist country's system, strengthening goal-driven approaches, gathering consensus and joint efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantees for schools to catch up with the world's advanced level at an accelerated pace. It is essential to realize that building world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach; each school must showcase its unique character and features while playing to its strengths. The characteristics of education should not only reflect common Chinese features but also embody each university's unique goal orientation, educational traditions, and resource endowments. For Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects in our education: Emphasizing the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, constructing an integrated educational environment that combines science, education, and industry, and forming a comprehensive entrepreneurship education ecosystem; Emphasizing the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, creating an institutional environment for interdisciplinary studies, and actively cultivating emerging interdisciplinary subjects and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; Emphasizing the characteristics of the educational system and social services, carrying out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-academia-research cooperation system. In this process, it is particularly important to always uphold the university spirit and let it resonate with the spirit of the times. For Zhejiang University, the motto "Seeking Truth and Innovation," the shared values of "diligent learning, cultivating virtue, discerning truth, and being steadfast," and the principles of "embracing diversity, pursuing truth and virtue, pioneering innovation, and contributing to our nation" together constitute the latest expression of the Zhejiang University spirit. This rich and profound system is an important guarantee for the university to adhere to the correct direction of education, continuously accumulate cultural height, and gather spiritual strength. Among these, "embracing diversity" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the ambition to attract global talent and learning from the world's top universities' educational concepts; "pursuing truth and virtue" highlights the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, meaning that universities should not only pursue truth but also cultivate moral character; "pioneering innovation" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, encompassing the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific research innovation, as well as development and renewal through reform; "contributing to our nation" stresses the spirit of patriotism and dedication, emphasizing that universities should always share the same fate as the nation. This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year history of education. "The wise hear the inaudible, the perceptive see the invisible." Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of China's socialist cause, deeply grasp the era's position and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities. At the same time, we must adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, allowing the university spirit to resonate with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, thereby providing inexhaustible motivation for realizing national prosperity and rejuvenation and the common ideals of humanity.
