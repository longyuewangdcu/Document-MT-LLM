Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times-Xinhua.com The so-called university spirit refers to a series of philosophy and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of development over a long period of time, which is the soul of the university. From ancient times to the present, university spirit is crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation. Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For our university, which emerged in the autumn of the national crisis, its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "Mingde Jiji, Xiuqi Zhiping" and The spirit of the university is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, and advocates the values of "Mingde JiShi, Cultivating Qi, and ruling Ping" and the patriotism of "XingXueQi and strengthening the country". At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious, and the global competition for education, science and technology, and talents is intensifying, and the structural reform of higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges. In particular, the "overall plan to promote the construction of world-class universities and first-class disciplines", while demonstrating China's confidence and determination to move from a large higher education country to a strong higher education country, has put forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities. How to be among the world's top universities in a relatively short period of time and speed up the establishment of several world class universities and a number of world class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap to achieve "overtaking"? In addition to firm confidence in goals, paths and abilities, universities should also give full play to three kinds of advantages: first, the advantage of latecomers, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve significant improvement in academic level and school quality; second, the cultural advantage, inherit the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated in five thousand years, and promote the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to coalesce The third is the institutional advantage, giving full play to the superiority of the system of the socialist country, strengthening the goal-driven, gathering consensus and synergy, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantee for the university to accelerate catching up with the world advanced level. In particular, we must realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while playing to its strengths. The characteristics of the school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, school tradition and resource endowment. As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on highlighting three characteristics in running the university: first, highlighting the characteristics of training innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated education environment with the integration of science and education and university-enterprise integration, and forming a whole chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second, highlighting the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, creating an institutional environment for interdisciplinary crossover, and actively cultivating crossover emerging disciplines and landmark crossover achievements. Third, it highlights the characteristics of school system and social services, carries out deep international exchange and cooperation, and accelerates the formation of Pan-Zhejiang University's industry-university-research cooperation system. In this process, it is especially important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with each other. For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "diligent learning, cultivating virtue, discernment and practicality" and the common values of "accepting the rivers, enlightening the truth and virtue, opening up things before the people, and making our country a nation" together constitute the spirit of Zhejiang University. "Together, they constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University. This is an important guarantee for the university to adhere to the correct direction of school running, accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual power, which is rich in connotation and far-reaching. Among them, the "sea of rivers" emphasizes the spirit of openness and tolerance, embodies the mind of "the world's talents for my use", and expresses the quality concept of learning from world-renowned universities; "Qizhen Houde " emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and goodness, which means that while pursuing truth, the university should receive the cultivation of virtue and the sharpening of personality; " open up the things before the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both the search for new knowledge and innovation in scientific research, as well as the reform and development, and the reform of the old and the new. The spirit of patriotism and dedication is emphasized in "Make our country a better place", which means that the university should always share the fate of the nation. This series of spiritual philosophy and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of operation. "The intelligent person hears in silence, and the wise person sees in the unformed". Chinese universities should further base on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of becoming a world-class university. At the same time, they should adhere to the humanistic care and independent freedom, so that the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit can stir each other, thus providing inexhaustible power to achieve national wealth and strength and national revitalization, and realize the common ideal of human beings.
