Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times the same resonance-Xinhuanet's so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running concepts and value pursuit formed by a university in the process of development, which is the soul of the university.	 From ancient times to the present, the spirit of university spirit is critical to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and society, and even the progress of a nation.	 Since the birth of universities in the world's first modern sense, universities have a unique mission different from other social organizations. For our universities in my country, the spirit of emergence in the autumn of national crisis is even more deeply affected by traditional culture and changes in the times. The influence of advocating the value concept of "Mingde Ji Shi, cultivating Qi Zhi Ping" and the patriotic responsibility of "learning and learning power".	 At present, the trend of information technology and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly obvious. Global education competition, scientific and technological competition, and talent competition have been increasing. Higher education is an important "supply side". Its structural reforms are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges. In particular, the proposal of "Overall Promoting the Overall Plan for the Construction of World -class universities and first -class disciplines", while demonstrating the confidence and determination of my country from higher education to higher education, it is also a higher update requirement for university development. Essence	 How to work hard to enter the world's first -class ranks in a short period of time, and accelerate the establishment of several world -class universities and a number of world -class disciplines on the basis of still a certain gap to achieve "curve overtaking"?	 In addition to firm goals, self -confidence, and confidence in ability, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: First, the post -development advantage, through continuous introduction of outstanding academic talents overseas, learn from the advanced experience of world -class universities, achieve academic level and school quality of school running, and school quality	 A significant improvement; the second is the cultural advantage, inheriting the intelligent connotation of the accumulation of Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, so as to consolidate strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image;	 Sex, strengthen target -driven, bring together consensus joint efforts, optimize resource allocation, and provide sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate the world's advanced level.	 In particular, we must realize that the construction of a world -class university cannot be a thousand universities. While exerting its advantages, various schools must show their personality and characteristics.	 The characteristics of running schools must not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique goals, traditions of running schools, and resource endowments. As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running schools: First, highlight the characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurial talents, build an integrated education environment for integration of science and education, school -enterprise integration, and form a full -chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; second	 It is to highlight the characteristics of the discipline cross -meeting meeting, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for cross -disciplinary cross -institutional environment, and actively cultivate cross -emerging disciplines and iconic crossings; the third is to highlight the schooling system and social service characteristics, carry out in -depth international exchanges and cooperation, accelerate the formation of formation	 Fan Zhejiang University's Normal University of Normal University.	 In this process, it is particularly important that we must always adhere to the spirit of college and allow the spirit of the university to resonate with the times as the times.	 For Zhejiang University, "seeking innovation" school motto, the common values of "diligence, cultivation, clearing, and honesty", as well as "Hainan River, Qizhen Houde, Kaishi, Tree and Our State" together constitute together.	 The latest expression system for the spirit of Zhejiang University.	 This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school and constantly accumulate cultural heights and condense spiritual power.	 Among them, the "Hainan River" emphasizes the open and inclusive spirit, reflecting the mind of "the world's talents is only used by me", and manifested as the high -quality concept of learning to run a school in the world.	 The spirit of goodness refers to the pursuit of the truth, but also to receive the cultivation of morality and the hard work of the personality;	 In order to reform and develop, the revolutionary is new; the "Tree and One State" emphasize the spirit of patriotism, and it is said that the university should always humiliate with the fate of the nation. This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuit is the soul of the 120 years of Zhejiang University.	 "Satoshi listened to silence, and the Ming people were seen in the form."	 Chinese universities further based on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly grasped the times and the historical mission of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerated the construction into a world -class university.	 At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation, so as to provide inexhaustible motivation for the realization of the country's prosperity and the revitalization of the country, the realization of the people's common ideals.
