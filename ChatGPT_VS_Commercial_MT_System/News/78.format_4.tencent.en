The university spirit is the soul of a university. Since ancient times, the university spirit has been vital to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation. Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations.The university of our country, rising in the autumn of national crisis, its spirit is deeply influenced by the traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "Mingde Jishi, Xiuqi Zhiping" and the patriotism of "Xingxue Powerful Country".Its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges. In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Overall Planning and Promoting the Construction of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to move forward from a big country in higher education to a powerful country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for university development. How to strive to rank among the world-class ranks in a relatively short period of time and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap?In addition to firm goal confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, colleges and universities should give full play to three advantages:First, the advantage of latecomer, through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality;The second is cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, carrying forward and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brand and enhance image.Third, institutional advantages, give play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen goal-driven, pool consensus and joint efforts, optimize resource allocation, and provide a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced level. In particular, we must realize that building a world-class university cannot be achieved by thousands of schools. While giving full play to their advantages, each school must highlight its individuality and characteristics. School-running characteristics should not only have common China characteristics, but also reflect their unique goal orientation.School-running tradition and resource endowment. As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting three characteristics in running schools:First, highlight the characteristics of innovative and entrepreneurial talents training, construct an integrated education environment integrating science and education and combining schools and enterprises, and form a full-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem;The second is to highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary integration, and actively cultivate cross-emerging disciplines and landmark cross-disciplinary achievements;The third is to highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system. In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times. For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "diligent study, moral cultivation, discernment, and honesty", and the "sea of rivers, enlightenment of truth and virtue, opening up things to the people,The "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "all the talents in the world are for our use", and shows the high-quality concept of absorbing the world famous schools to educate people."Enlightenment of truth and virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, which means that universities should receive the cultivation of virtue and the encouragement of personality while pursuing truth.The spirit of reform and innovation is embodied in the spirit of "opening up things before the people", which not only includes the innovation of knowledge and scientific research, but also shows the reform and development and the reform and innovation."Building our country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, and that universities should always share glory and humiliation with the destiny of the nation. This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of running a school."The wise hear in silence, and the wise see in the future." China universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the position of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of a world-class university. At the same time, they should adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, so that the university spirit, the spirit of the times, and the national spirit can interact with each other.so as to provide an inexhaustible motive force for that realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.
