Guangxi university students can take up to 5 years off for entrepreneurship - Xinhua News Agency Nanning, May 19th (Reporter Zhang Ying) - The reporter recently learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Department of Education that from now on, Guangxi universities will implement a flexible school system, relaxing the limits on the number of years students can take off from school. The duration of a student's leave for entrepreneurship can be extended by 2 to 5 years based on the original study period, and this time can be considered as part of their practical education. To promote the improvement of entrepreneurial and innovative abilities among college students, Guangxi's education, human resources, and other departments are working together to build entrepreneurial platforms, constructing more off-campus practice teaching bases, university science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and business incubation bases to provide external support for college students' entrepreneurship. According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in colleges and universities should reach over 30,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and over 20,000 square meters for vocational colleges. The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credits and gives priority to supporting students who perform excellently in innovation and entrepreneurship practice in changing their majors. University teachers are required to spend at least two months every two years working in industry enterprises to improve their awareness and ability in innovation and entrepreneurship education. The Autonomous Region Department of Education requires all universities in Guangxi to deeply implement the college student innovation and entrepreneurship training program, striving to ensure that every student participates in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their time at school. Universities should actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions and provide financial support.
