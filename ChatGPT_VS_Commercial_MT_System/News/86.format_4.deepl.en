In addition to his achievements in the fields of economic development, economic growth, and East Asian economics, he is also a visionary educational leader. In short, he has distinguished himself in numerous fields. Professor Shuji Nakamura is a pioneer in sustainable energy technology, said Sun Yifeng, who read the citation. He was one of three winners of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of the blue light-emitting diode (LED). Professor Nakamura's invention not only revolutionized the lighting industry, but also contributed to the creation of white light-emitting diodes that are now widely used in daily life and industrial production, making a great contribution to the well-being of mankind. Reading out the tribute to Li Lanjuan, Sun Yifeng said that Professor Li Lanjuan, as the pioneer of the artificial liver business in China, created the unique and effective Li's artificial liver system, which has led to a major breakthrough in the treatment of liver failure in severe hepatitis and significantly reduced the death rate of liver failure. In the battle against the new pneumonia, she and her team proposed the "four anti-treated and two balanced" protocol and brought the three major technologies of artificial liver, microecology and stem cells, which significantly increased the rate of critical illnesses. In his speech, Sun Yifeng said that Professor Li has laid the foundation for innovative research in operations management, shaped the way of thinking in supply chain theory and practice, and revolutionized business models around the world. Li Xiaoliang is known for popularizing the concept of the long-whip effect in operations management and exploring measures to counteract this phenomenon. Today, the long-whip effect is becoming more pronounced in countries under epidemic and tense economic situations, triggering serious disruptions in the supply chain. Li Xiaoliang's visionary research is like a blessing in disguise, helping the industry to cope with the predicament, thus bringing great social value. Sun Yifeng read out Zhu Liran's praise speech, saying that in her scientific work, she discovered a groundbreaking and innovative staining technique for sample preparation and enjoyed a high reputation among her scientific and technological peers at home and abroad.
