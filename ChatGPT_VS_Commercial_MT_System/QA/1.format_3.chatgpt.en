What's wrong when a Jetta car stalls when stepping on the gas pedal? Is it manual or automatic? Are you sure you have a good grasp of the clutch? It's manual. When in neutral and stepping on the gas, the car stalls. We have checked the fuel injection and ignition, and they are fine. Who told you to step on the gas in neutral? Which instructor? Cut him off. Shift into gear and step on the gas immediately, isn't stepping on the gas in neutral pointless?
