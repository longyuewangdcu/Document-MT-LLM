The Jetta car stalls when stepping on the gas pedal, what's going on? Is it manual or automatic? Are you sure you've mastered the clutch? It's manual. The engine stalls when revving in neutral; both fuel injection and ignition have been checked and found to be without problems. Who told you to rev in neutral? Which instructor? Fire him. After engaging the gear, quickly follow up with the gas. Isn't revving in neutral unnecessary?
