Working out of town. Today is my birthday, but my phone is turned off. I don't want to tell my friends, as I don't want to be ignored. Bought a cake to celebrate by myself! Can netizens send me some blessings? Happy Birthday, have a great day! Thank you. You're welcome. The most important thing is for everyone to be happy.
