Can someone help me check the IP address of this QQ? It's better to have a detailed address. A scammer took 200 yuan from me!!! It's not useful to use QQ IP address proxy to locate only a certain area. Besides, it's not possible to check the address even if the scammer is using QQ. It seems like the scammer is still using QQ. Then you should download a version of QQ that can display IP addresses.
