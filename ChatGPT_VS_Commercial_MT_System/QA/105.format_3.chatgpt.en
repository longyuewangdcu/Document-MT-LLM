Can someone help me check the IP address of this QQ? It's better to have a detailed address. A scammer came and cheated me out of 200 yuan!!! I suggest you report it to the police, although it may not be useful. IP addresses can only be used to locate a general area. Only knowing the QQ number cannot locate the address. He logged in using his mobile QQ. Why can't he access the internet with mobile data? Check the firewall settings. Where are they set, in the system settings? What is the model of your phone? Check if there is any firewall software installed. It's a Samsung E220. Why can't I access web pages with mobile data? Is the network too slow, like a 2G network? No, it's 3G. Try restarting or changing the browser. If UC doesn't work, try Opera.
