How can I flash my phone? Different models may have different methods. If your phone supports flashing, you can download a flashing master tool and enable USB debugging on your phone. Connect your phone to your computer, and the master tool will automatically download the necessary drivers. Then, download the ROM package (the firmware you want to flash) to your computer and open it with the flashing tool. Click on ""flash"" and the tool will do the rest. Thank you. After I flashed my Huawei c8812, it became stuck. What should I do? You should get it repaired. It's now a brick. You can try reinstalling the system, but it's difficult to do it yourself. How much does it cost to repair it? It's around 70 yuan (approximately $11).
