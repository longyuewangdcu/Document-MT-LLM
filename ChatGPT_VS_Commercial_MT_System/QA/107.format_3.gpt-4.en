How can I flash my phone? Can you please give some advice? Different models may have different methods. If your phone supports one-click flashing, you can download a flashing tool, then enable USB debugging on your phone, connect your phone to the computer, and the flashing tool will automatically download the drivers. After the drivers are downloaded, find the ROM package (i.e., the flashing package) you want to flash, download it to your computer, and then open the ROM package in the one-click flashing section of the flashing tool. Click on the flash button, and it will be done automatically. Thank you. After flashing my Huawei C8812, it became a brick. What should I do? You should get it repaired! It turned into a brick. Reinstalling the system will fix it. How can I reinstall it? You should have someone else fix it! It's hard to do it yourself. How much would it cost to fix it? Around 70 (currency not specified) should be enough!
