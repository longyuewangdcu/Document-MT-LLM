What's the difference between the original package and the scattered chips of the CPU? There's no difference. One is packaged and the other is not. The scattered chips are more likely to be fake. Do all original package CPUs come with a heatsink? Is it enough to use? It depends on the specific CPU model and the requirements of its cooling. Generally, original package CPUs come with a suitable heatsink, but for high-performance CPUs, you may need to purchase a more powerful cooler. How about this configuration? I want to be able to play large single-player games and watch HD movies. This configuration should be sufficient for watching HD movies, but it may struggle with large single-player games at maximum settings. For the same price range, I suggest choosing a slightly stronger graphics card, such as the 7770 instead of the 650. Can you recommend a configuration for around 3000 RMB? Do you need a monitor? Yes, I do. This configuration should be able to handle HD movies and some games, but for high-performance gaming, you may need to invest more in a stronger graphics card and CPU. How about this configuration? I want to be able to play large single-player games and watch HD movies.
