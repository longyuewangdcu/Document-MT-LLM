What is the difference between an original packaged CPU and a loose piece? There is no difference, except one is without packaging and the other is with packaging. Loose pieces are more likely to be fake. Do original packaged CPUs come with a heat sink, and is it enough? How is this configuration? It should be able to play large-scale single-player games and watch high-definition videos. It should be sufficient for most use cases but may struggle with large-scale games. For a similar price range, I recommend a GPU like the Radeon HD 7770 over the GeForce GTX 650 as it's slightly stronger. Can you please suggest a configuration within a budget of 3000? Do you need a monitor? Yes. How is this configuration? It should be able to play large-scale single-player games and watch high-definition videos. This configuration may not be able to handle all special effects in large-scale games, but it's absolutely fine for watching high-definition movies. I hope my answer can help you. Without special effects, as long as it runs smoothly, it's fine.
