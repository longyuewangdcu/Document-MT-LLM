I would like to ask a question. There is a newly renovated internet cafe nearby with all new equipment. I played Need for Speed 14 with all the special effects turned up to the maximum and there was no lag at all. What are the computer specifications and prices? Even the worst internet cafes have dedicated graphics cards, while some computers sold three years ago with integrated graphics cards cannot run Need for Speed smoothly. They cost around 3000 yuan and are not guaranteed to run the game smoothly. My computer, which cost 4500 yuan, can handle it without any problems.
