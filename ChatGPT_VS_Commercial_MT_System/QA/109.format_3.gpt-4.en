I want to ask a question. There's a newly decorated internet cafe nearby. All the equipment is new, and you can play "Need for Speed 14" with all the special effects turned up to the highest level without any lag. What's the computer configuration? How much does it cost? Even the worst internet cafes have dedicated graphics cards, but my computer has an integrated graphics card. Three years ago, internet cafe computers could run "Need for Speed" faster than my 3000 yuan computer, and I'm sure it will lag while playing the game on my 4500 yuan computer.
