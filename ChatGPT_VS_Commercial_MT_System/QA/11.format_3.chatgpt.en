My company requires employees to buy a car in order to continue working. After buying a car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan for the car. If you don't buy a car, you will automatically resign. May I ask if there are any car brands that are less expensive than the BYD F0 and the Jiangnan TT, or maybe second-hand cars? Some second-hand Xia Li cars are only a few thousand yuan, let's see if you dare to drive them! The company requires us to buy a brand new car. As far as I know, the Jiangnan TT is the cheapest option, but it still costs 20,800 yuan, which is too expensive. I only have 20,000 yuan, and I also need to pay for license plates and get a driver's license. It's too difficult, and it's impossible for me to achieve it!
