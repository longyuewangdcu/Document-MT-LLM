The company I work for requires employees to purchase a car in order to continue working. After buying a car, the company provides a subsidy of 88 RMB for the car. If you don't buy a car, you will automatically resign. I wonder what brand of car is cheaper than BYD F0 and Jiangnan TT, or maybe a second-hand one. Some second-hand Xiali cars only cost a few thousand. It depends on whether you dare to drive them! The company requires buying a brand-new car. As far as I know, Jiangnan TT is the cheapest at 20,800 RMB. That's too expensive. I only have 20,000 RMB, and that also needs to cover the cost of getting a license plate and a driver's license. It's so difficult, impossible to achieve!
