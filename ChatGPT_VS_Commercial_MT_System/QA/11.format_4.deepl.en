My company requires employees to purchase a car to continue to work, buy a car after the company subsidized 88 yuan car allowance, do not buy a car will automatically leave. What brand of car is there BYD F0 too expensive Jiangnan TT or second-hand, some second-hand Xiali only a few thousand, see you dare to drive! The company asked to buy a brand new I know Jiangnan TT is the cheapest! 2.08 million is too expensive. I only have 20,000 yuan to include the license and a driving license it is too difficult, impossible to achieve!
