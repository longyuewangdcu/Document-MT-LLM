My company requires employees to buy a car before they can continue to work.	 What brand of car BYD F0 is too expensive in Jiangnan TT, or there are thousands of second -hand Charles. Seeing you dare to drive!	 The company requires buying a new Jiangnan TT I know is the cheapest!	 20,800 is too expensive.	 I only have 20,000 yuan and it is too difficult to include a license and a driver's license. It is impossible to achieve it!
