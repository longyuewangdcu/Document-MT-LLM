My company requires employees to buy a car to continue to work, buy a car after the company subsidies 88 yuan car, do not buy a car will automatically leave. I would like to ask what brand of car BYD F0 is too expensive Jiangnan TT or second-hand, some second-hand Xiali only a few thousand, see you dare to open! The company requires to buy a new I know Jiangnan TT is the cheapest! 20,800 too expensive. I only have 20,000 yuan, including the license plate and test a driver's license it is too difficult, impossible to achieve!
