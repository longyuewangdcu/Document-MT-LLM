I'd like to ask a question. There's a newly-opened internet cafe nearby with brand new equipment. Playing "Need for Speed 14" with the highest graphics settings doesn't lag at all. The computer specs might be different, like the system storage capacity. What is system storage capacity? Is it referring to a specific disk or something? Do you know what GB means? If you don't know, I think you're just a fool. The internet cafe's single-player game disk is 1024G. Is this the difference? How can I download the "Soulmate Friendship" app? There's no client, so I can only use a browser. Oh
