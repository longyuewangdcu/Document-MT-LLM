I want to ask a question. There is a new Internet cafe nearby. The devices are new.	 What is it?	 It means which disk or what GB do you know? Do you know? I do nâ€™t know if I think you are a fool. The single -machine game disk of the Internet cafe is 1024G. Is this the difference? How can you download the confidant friends? oh
