I would like to ask a question. There is a newly installed Internet cafe nearby. The equipment is all new. When playing Apex 14, the special effects are turned to the highest level, and there is no card at all. The computer configuration parameter may be that the capacity is different. What is the system storage capacity? Which disk or GB does it refer to? Do you know? Do you know? I think you are an idiot. The stand-alone game disk in the Internet cafe is 1024G.Is this the difference? How can I download friends without a client can only use a browser Oh, wow.
