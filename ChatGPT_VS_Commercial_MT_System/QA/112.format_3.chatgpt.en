Where can I download 1080p high-definition movies? I don't want to use torrents for downloading, nor do I want to use Thunder (a download manager) because it's too slow. Even though it's faster with Thunder, I still have to become a VIP member to access the high-speed channel and offline downloading. I use an Android device, and the speed test shows that I have several hundred kilobytes per second, but Thunder downloads at only a few kilobytes per second. This is frustrating!
