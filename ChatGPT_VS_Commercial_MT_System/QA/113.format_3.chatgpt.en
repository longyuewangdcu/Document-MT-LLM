What's wrong with my computer monitor? It always goes black after being turned on for half a minute, but if I turn it off and on again, it's okay. However, after another half minute, it goes black again. I think it's not a problem with the display screen, but with the motherboard causing the black screen. Turning off and on the monitor's power can fix the problem, but it goes black again after a while. My friend's computer had the same problem a few days ago, and they solved it by replacing the screen with a new one. This method is effective. When replacing the screen, be sure to pay attention to the price and don't get ripped off.
