My computer monitor keeps going black, what's going on? (It turns black after being on for half a minute, then it's fine if I turn it off and on again! But it goes black again after another half minute! It doesn't seem to be a motherboard issue, but a screen issue. Turning the monitor power off and on again fixes it temporarily, but it goes black again after a while. A few days ago, my friend's computer had the same problem, and it was fixed after they replaced the screen with a new one. This solution is not bad, solving the problem at once. When replacing the screen, pay attention to the price and don't get scammed.
