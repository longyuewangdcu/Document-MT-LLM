What's wrong with my computer monitor? It keeps going black after being on for half a minute, and then it's fine again when I turn it off and on. But after half a minute, it goes black again. It's not the VGA interface of the main display that's aging. Which interface is it? How should I deal with it? I suggest you take it to a computer repair shop and have it looked at. It's quite troublesome to fix it. Even computer repair professionals may not know how to fix a monitor. Yeah, it's especially troublesome.
