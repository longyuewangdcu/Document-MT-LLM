My computer monitor keeps going black, what's going on? (It goes black after being on for half a minute, and then if I turn it off and on again, it's fine! But then it goes black again after half a minute! It's not the main monitor VGA interface aging, which interface is it? What should I do? Maybe I should go to a computer repair shop and have a look, but it's very troublesome. The computer repair people also seem to have no words about the monitor issue. Yeah, it's particularly bothersome.
