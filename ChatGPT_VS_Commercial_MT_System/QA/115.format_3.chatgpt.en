What's wrong with my computer monitor? It always goes black after half a minute of being turned on, but it's fine again after I turn it off and on. However, after half a minute, it goes black again. It's not because the cable behind your monitor is not plugged in properly, because it works fine before going black. I turn off the monitor's power and turn it on again to get the display back, but it goes black again after a while. If it's not a cable issue, then it could be a problem with your monitor's power cord. Try using the power cord from your rice cooker at home. My monitor is a TV-style display, so it could be either a cable issue or a problem with your plug.
