My computer monitor keeps going black, what's going on! (It goes black after being on for half a minute, and then if I turn it off and on again, it works! But then it goes black again after half a minute!) It's not the main cable at the back of your monitor being loose, is it? Everything works fine, but then it goes black! Turning the monitor power off and on works temporarily, but then it goes black again. There might be a problem with your monitor's power cable; try using the power cable from your rice cooker at home. My monitor is a TV-style monitor. If it's not a cable issue, then there might be a problem with your power socket.
