What's wrong with my computer monitor that it keeps going black? It turns off after half a minute, and then I have to turn it off and on again to make it work. But after half a minute, it's back to the same problem again. Could it be a problem with the main transformer? When it goes black, I turn off the monitor and then turn it on again, and it works. But after a while, it goes black again. Is it a problem with the cable? Which cable are you referring to? The cable that connects the host to the monitor.
