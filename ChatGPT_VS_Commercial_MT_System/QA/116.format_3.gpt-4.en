My computer monitor keeps going black, what's going on! (It goes black after being turned on for half a minute, then if I turn it off and on again, it's fine! But then it goes black again after half a minute! Is there a problem with the main transformer? The screen goes black! If I turn off the monitor's power and turn it back on, it works again! But after a while, it goes black again. Is there a problem with the cable?
