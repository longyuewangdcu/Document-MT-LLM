What's wrong with my computer monitor that it keeps turning black? (It turns black after being on for half a minute, then it's fine if I turn it off and on again. But after half a minute, it goes black again. Isn't the main monitor port connected properly? Everything was working fine until it suddenly turned black. I turn off the monitor power and turn it back on, and it works again, but after a while, it goes black again. I suggest you try changing the monitor power cord and using your rice cooker's cord to see if it works. Mine is a TV-style monitor, as long as the voltage is not a problem! I really don't know what's wrong with it.
