"What's wrong with my computer monitor that it keeps going black? It goes black after being turned on for half a minute, then it's fine if I turn it off and on again. But after half a minute, it goes black again. Isn't the main display port connected properly? Everything was fine, and suddenly it goes black! I turn off the monitor power and turn it back on, and it works again! But after a while, it goes black again. I suggest you try changing the monitor power cord and try using your rice cooker's cord. Mine has a TV-style monitor, as long as the voltage is not a problem! I really don't know what's going on."
