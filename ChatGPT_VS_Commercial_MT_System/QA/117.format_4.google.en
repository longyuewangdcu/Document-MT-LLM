What's the matter with my computer display old black screen!	 (Open it for half a minute and then turn it on again when you turn it off! It will be like that after half a minute! Isn't it the main display port connect? It â€™s okay to have a black screen!	 After a while, it will be dark again. I suggest that you change the display power cord of the display. Try the line of the rice cooker of your home.
