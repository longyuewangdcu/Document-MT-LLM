My computer monitor old black screen is how to return a responsibility!(Open half a minute to black screen and then close again open like! Half a minute later it is like that again! Is not the main monitor port connected well? Well, nothing is all right black screen! Turn off the monitor power and then open there! But after a while it is black again I suggest you change the monitor power cord and try to use your home point rice cooker cable to try my TV monitor as long as the voltage is no problem! This really do not know
