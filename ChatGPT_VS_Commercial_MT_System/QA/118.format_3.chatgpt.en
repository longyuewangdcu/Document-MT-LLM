Samsung S4 upgraded to 4.42. Why did it fail to root with 360 one-click root? Have you rooted your phone with 360 one-click root? You should connect your phone to a computer and use 360 one-click root on the computer. That's how I did it on my phone and it worked. I uninstalled a lot of pre-installed programs. You can give it a try. As for the failed root, well, then I'm not sure. Sorry I couldn't help you.
