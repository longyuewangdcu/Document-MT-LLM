The Samsung S4 has been upgraded to 4.42, but why did it fail to root with the 360 One-click Root? Did you use the 360 One-click Root on your phone? You should connect your phone to the computer and use the 360 One-click Root on the computer. That's how I did it on my phone, and it was successful. I uninstalled many pre-installed programs. Give it a try. As for the failed root, haha, I'm not sure then, sorry I couldn't help you.
