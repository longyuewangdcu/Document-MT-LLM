My child is almost 4 years old and is taken care of by my grandmother in the countryside. When we were at the market, my child hid by the roadside and was hit by a car. The other party did not have compulsory insurance. May I ask who is responsible for the accident? The teacher is fully responsible because you should have been more careful when taking care of your child by the roadside. Thank you. You're welcome. It's my pleasure to help.
