My child is nearly 4 years old and is taken care of by his grandmother in the countryside. He hid by the roadside during a market day but was still hit by a car. The other party's vehicle did not have compulsory traffic insurance. How should the responsibility be calculated? The teacher is fully responsible because you avoided it first and it was by the roadside. Be more careful when taking care of children... Thank you. You're welcome... it's what should be done!
