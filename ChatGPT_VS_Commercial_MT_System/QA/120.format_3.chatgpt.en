I tried to use 360 One-Click Root to root my Samsung S4 after upgrading to Android 4.4.2, but it failed. Why? Upgrading the Android system may make the phone slower, and rooting the phone may also make the system slower. Since you have already upgraded, it's best not to root it. Although it may be inconvenient to not have root access and it may consume more data, there are many self-starting apps. It's up to you. The S4 runs fast, so rooting may not cause too much lag. I understand, but sometimes when I include a header file like dos.h, VC shows an error message like "unnamed result."
