What does the broadband network symbol display? Is it an exclamation mark? I only see "network limited" and can't access the internet on my phone. Can your computer access the internet? How many routers are connected to your broadband? If you can't connect with only one router, was it just installed today and not working, or did it stop working suddenly after a few days of use? I've been using it for a month and suddenly can't connect, and I didn't change any router settings.
