What does the broadband network icon show? Is it an exclamation mark? I only see that the network is limited. My phone is connected but cannot access the internet. Can your computer connect? How many routers is your broadband connected to? Can't connect, just one. When did you start using the router? Is it newly installed today and not working, or did it stop working after a few days of use? I have been using it for a month, and it suddenly can't connect without any router settings changed.
