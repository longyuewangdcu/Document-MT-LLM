What is the broadband network symbol showing!	 Is it an exclamation mark? Just see that the network limited mobile phone can not be available on the Internet, can your computer be available? Your broadband has a few routers. When will one use the router?	 Can't use it, it still can't be used for a few days after a few days, and it can not be available for a month, and there is no router.
