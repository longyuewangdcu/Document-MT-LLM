What does the broadband network symbol show? Is it an exclamation mark? I only see that the network is limited. The mobile phone can 't connect to the network. Can you get on your computer? Your broadband is connected to several routers. I can' t get on the 1. When did you use the router? Was it just installed today, and it can 't be used? Or did it suddenly fail after a few days of use? It suddenly failed after a month of use, and there was no router set up
