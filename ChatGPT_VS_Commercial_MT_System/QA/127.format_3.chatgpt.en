The Teddy dog has dandruff and shedding for three months. How can I treat it? My dog had dandruff before and was very itchy and scratching all the time. We went to two pet hospitals. One said there was nothing wrong, and the other said it was severe and required a one-month injection. We checked the skin to see if there were any small red spots, which could be mites. We can use 886887 or carbaryl to soak in the bath. If there are no small red spots, then it is not caused by mites.
