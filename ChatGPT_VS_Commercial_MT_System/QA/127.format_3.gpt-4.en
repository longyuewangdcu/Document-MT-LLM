The Teddy dog is three months old and has dandruff and hair loss; how can it be treated? My family's dog had dandruff before, and the dog was very itchy, constantly scratching. We went to two pet hospitals. One said it was not a problem, while the other said it was severe and required injections for one month. Check if there are any small red dots on the skin, as it might be mites. Use 886887 or dichlorvos if there are no small red dots.
