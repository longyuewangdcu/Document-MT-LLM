The teddy dog has dandruff on its body for three q months. How to cure it? The dog had dandruff before my family. The dog was very itchy and kept scratching. I went to two pet hospitals. One said it was fine, and the other said it was very serious and needed an injection for one month. Check whether there are small red spots on the skin. It may be mites. I used 886887 or amitraz to soak it, but there were no small red spots.
