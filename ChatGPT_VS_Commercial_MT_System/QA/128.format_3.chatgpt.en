When the Seagate Backup Plus portable hard drive is connected to the computer, the computer cannot start up. It's a common problem for some portable storage devices. The computer may try to boot up directly from the portable storage device that you plugged in, but some computers won't do that. It's frustrating to have to unplug and plug in the hard drive every time you turn on or off the computer. Sometimes, even when the computer starts up, it still can't recognize the hard drive. You may need to change the hard drive mode to IDE or Compatibility mode in the BIOS settings, or use a partition software called DiskGenius that can be downloaded online to fix the issue. DiskGenius DiskMan in Tianyi can detect your hard drive, but it may not read the correct size. The 7.9GB size may be your Kingston USB drive. To fix it, you can change the hard drive mode to Compatibility or IDE in the BIOS, or install Windows 7 or use Win7 PE to see the hard drive. Also, when it comes to graphics cards, it's more important to look at the chip model rather than the video memory or bandwidth. Integrated graphics with a large video memory doesn't necessarily perform better than a high-end discrete graphics card. If you don't know, please don't make random comments. If you don't believe it, check where your integrated graphics card is positioned on the graphics card ladder chart. Why are you even considering video memory and bandwidth? Video memory is only relevant to resolution nowadays. Bandwidth is generally related to anti-aliasing. If you prefer to believe in JS's video memory theory, don't bother responding to me. Anyway, when evaluating a graphics card, I focus on the chip model and stream processors. Video memory and bandwidth are secondary considerations.
