The computer cannot start when the Seagate Backup Plus portable hard drive is connected. It's simple, plug in the portable hard drive after entering the WIN7 system, as some mobile storage devices have this issue. When starting up, it will try to boot directly from the connected mobile storage device, but some devices won't do that. You don't want to plug and unplug the portable hard drive every time you turn the computer on and off. Sometimes, when the computer starts up and the portable hard drive is still connected, it won't boot up, and you have to force a restart. The hard drive is not visible. Go into BIOS when booting up and change the hard drive mode to IDE or compatibility mode, don't use ACHI, as some PE systems won't recognize it. Or you can go online and download a partition software called DiskGenius, copy it to your USB drive, and run it under PE. DiskGenius and DiskMan in PE can initially recognize a 7.9G hard drive but can't read its size, and later it is not recognized anymore. The 7.9G is your Kingston USB drive, go into BIOS and change the hard drive working mode, try compatibility mode or IDE, or you can directly install WIN7 or use WIN7 PE to see the hard drive. What is the memory bit width of a shared memory graphics card? Kids these days, why are you still looking at graphics memory? You should look at the graphics card chip model! This is an integrated graphics card, even if it has 15G of graphics memory, its performance will not be as good as a high-end discrete graphics card. If you don't know, don't comment recklessly. If you don't believe it, just check the position of your integrated graphics card on the graphics card hierarchy chart. Consider the graphics memory and bit width, okay? Graphics memory is now only related to resolution. Bit width is generally related to anti-aliasing. If you'd rather believe in the graphics memory myths, don't reply to me. Anyway, when I judge the quality of a graphics card, I look at the graphics card chip and the stream processors. Graphics memory and bit width are the least important factors.
