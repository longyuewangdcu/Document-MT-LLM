As soon as the computer is connected to the Seagate backup plus portable hard drive, it won't boot up It's very simple, enter the WIN7 system and then insert the portable hard drive, some portable storage devices have this problem. The boot will start directly from the removable storage device you plugged in, but some will not. You don't want to switch on and off to plug and unplug the removable hard drive, often boot up and find the removable hard drive is still plugged in and can't start, and have to force a reboot. I can't see the hard disk boot into the BIOS to change the mode of the hard disk to IDE or compatibility mode do not use ACHI providence PE can not be recognized or you can also go online to download a diskgenius partition software copy to your U disk inside and run the software under PE should be able to. The diskgenius diskman in ACHI initially recognized the hard disk 7.9G but could not read the size and then did not recognize the 7.9G that is your Kingston USB drive into the BIOS to change the working mode of the hard disk. Also into the compatibility mode or IDE either you directly take WIN7 installed also OK or use WIN7 pe into the hard drive can see the shared memory capacity of the graphics card memory bit width is how much Now the children, why also look at the graphics memory ...... to see the graphics chip model ah! You are a nuclear display, even if the video memory to you 15G, but, the performance is not as good as a high-end single display. If you don't know, don't comment randomly. You don't believe in forgetting, you see for yourself the position of your nucleus in the graphics ladder chart. In consideration of video memory and bit width, okay? Video memory is now only linked to the resolution. Bit width is generally linked to anti-aliasing. If you prefer to believe in JS's memory god theory, you should not get back to me. Anyway, I look at the graphics card is good or bad, is to see the graphics chip and stream processor. Memory and bit width are last in line.
