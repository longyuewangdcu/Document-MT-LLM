As soon as the computer, the Kaga Backup Plus mobile hard disk cannot be started. It is very simple. After entering the Win7 system, you insert a mobile hard disk. Some mobile storage devices have this problem.	 The boot will start directly from the mobile storage device you inserted, but some will not.	 I just do n’t want to turn on the mobile hard disk when I do n’t want to turn on. I often turn on it and find that the mobile hard disk cannot be started. It is necessary to force the restart.	 Can't see the hard disk boot into the BIOS, change the mode of the hard disk to IDE or compatible mode. Do not use Achi God's PE to recognize it or you can go online to download a DISKGENIUS partition software	 This software should be possible. DiskGenius Diskman in God just started to recognize the hard disk 7.9g but unable to read the size and then did not recognize 7.9G. The work mode of the hard disk of your Kingston U disk in your goldston U disk.	 Compatible mode or IDE either you can use Win7 to install or use Win7 PE to see how much the graphics card width of the graphics card with a hard disk shared memory capacity is now. Why do you still look at the memory ... It depends on the graphics card chip model!	 You are a nuclear display, even if the video memory gives you 15g, but the performance is not as good as a high -end independent display. Don't know if you don't know if you don't believe it, you don't believe it. You can see the location of your core display in the graphics card.	 Is it good to consider memory and bit width?	 The memory memory is now only linked to the resolution.	 Bit width is generally linked to anti -aliasing.	 If you would rather believe in JS's memory theory, don't go back to me.	 Anyway, I look at the graphics card. It is to see the graphics chip and flow processor.	 The memory and bit width are ranked last.
