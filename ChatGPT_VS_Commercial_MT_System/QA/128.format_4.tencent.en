Seagate backup plus mobile hard disk can not be started when the computer is connected. It is very simple. After entering the WIN7 system, insert the mobile hard disk. Some mobile storage devices have this problem. The boot will start directly from the mobile storage device you inserted, but some will not.Do not see the hard drive boot into the BIOS inside the hard drive mode changed to IDE or compatible mode do not use ACHI heaven PE can not recognize or you can also go online to download a diskgenius this partition software copied to your U disk inside and then run this software under PE should be able to.9G that is your Kingston U disk into the BIOS inside the hard drive to change the working mode. Also into a compatible mode or IDE or you can directly take WIN7 installed or use WIN7 pe into the hard drive can see the shared memory capacity of the graphics card memory bit width is how many children now, why also look at the memory ...... depends on the graphics chip model ah! If you don't know, don't make random comments and don't believe it. Take a look at your core's position on the graphics card ladder. Think about memory and bit width, okay? Memory is now only linked to resolution. Bit width is generally linked to anti-aliasing. If you would rather believe in JS memory theory, you don't return to me. Anyway, I see the quality of the graphics card, it is to see the graphics chip and stream processor. Memory and bit width are at the end.
