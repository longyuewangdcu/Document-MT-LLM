What is the fastest read and write speed for a hard drive? The average seek time for an SSD is 0.1 milliseconds, and for a 15000 RPM hard drive, it's about 5 milliseconds, while for a 10000 RPM hard drive, it's around 7 milliseconds. For desktops, we usually use 7200 RPM hard drives, and for laptops, we usually use 5400 RPM hard drives. The difference in read and write speed mainly depends on the seek time. Can you be more specific? Why is my FPS only 50 when playing CF? My CPU can't keep up. Before entering the game, lower the resolution, use 60HZ, decrease the contrast, and close unnecessary software. After entering the game, lower the bullet holes, weather effects, and other attributes. I was not experiencing any lag before these two days. I also went to a computer store, and they said my graphics card was fine. FPS is not solely determined by the graphics card. The CPU is the processor, and if the graphics card can keep up but the CPU can't, the game will still lag. Therefore, try the above solutions, and FPS should improve significantly. Also, playing AK with low FPS will affect your gameplay. Why is my FPS only 50 when playing CF? My internet speed isn't fast enough. I have the same problem, but as long as my internet speed is good enough, I can get 100 FPS. My internet speed is 6 Mbps and the ping is 12, so it's not possible that the issue is caused by my internet speed.
