What is the fastest hard disk read/write speed? The average seek time for an SSD is 0.1 milliseconds, for a 15,000 RPM hard disk it's about 5 milliseconds, and for a 10,000 RPM hard disk it's around 7 milliseconds. Desktop computers nowadays use 7,200 RPM hard disks while laptops generally use 5,400 RPM hard disks, the read/write speeds don't differ too much, just in the seek times. Can you be more specific? When I play CrossFire, it's so laggy, and my FPS is only 50. My CPU can't keep up. Before entering the game, lower the resolution, set it to 60Hz, and decrease the contrast. You can also close a software before entering the game and set attributes like bullet marks and weather to low. I didn't have this lag two days ago, but now I do. I went to the computer store and they said my graphics card is fine. A low FPS isn't determined solely by the graphics card; the CPU is the processor. If the graphics card can keep up but the CPU can't, it will still be laggy. So try the solutions above, your FPS should increase quite a bit. Also, playing with an AK with low FPS won't be affected too much. Why is my CrossFire so laggy with only 50 FPS? If your internet speed is not good enough, it will be like this. As long as your internet speed is good enough, having 100 FPS is not a problem. My internet speed is 6 Mbps, and the ping is 12, so it's impossible that it's due to the internet speed.
