Hard drive read and write speed is the fastest how much SSD SSD average seek time 0.1 milliseconds, 15000 rpm hard drive is about 5 milliseconds, 10000 rpm is about 7 milliseconds We now desktop with 7200 rpm notes version generally with 5400 rpm read and write difference is not too much in the seek time can specific point I play cf how so card FPS only 50 cpu can not keep up, into the game before, adjust Resolution low point, 60HZ, contrast small point, you can turn off a software into the game after the bullet traces, weather and other attributes are low point I am this 2 days card before today not card ah I also went to the computer store they are my graphics card no problem ah fps low graphics card is not the deciding factor, cpu is the processor, graphics card to keep up with the cpu can not keep up will also be card. So you try the above program, fps will add a lot, and fps low play ak impact not to play. I play cf how so card FPS only 50 network speed is not good enough for me too, as long as the network speed is good enough fps 100 no problem My Internet speed is 6 megabytes ah that ping is 12 ah can not be the speed of the network ah
