The fastest hard disk read and write speed is how much SSD solid -state hard disk is the average search time of 0.1 milliseconds, 15000 rpm hard drives about 5 milliseconds, 10000 rpm is about 7 milliseconds. We are currently using a 5400 rotation version of the 7200 rpm.	 More is worse. Can you be more specified? How can I play CF? How can I get a card FPS? 50 CPUs can not keep up.
