I play cf how so card FPS only 50 cpu can not keep up, before entering the game, adjust the resolution low, 60HZ, contrast point,You can turn off a software into the game, bullet marks, weather and other attributes are low I am the card 2 days ago today is not card ah I also went to the computer store they are my graphics card no problem ah fps low graphics card is not the decisive factor, cpu is the processor, graphics card can keep up with the cpu can not keep up with the card.so you try the above program, fps will increase a lot,Also, fps is low and playing ak does not affect playing. how come i'm so stuck when i play cf? FPS is only 50. the network speed is not good enough. i'm the same as long as the network speed is good enough, fps 100 is no problem My internet speed is 6 megabytes. that ping is 12. it can 't be the internet speed
