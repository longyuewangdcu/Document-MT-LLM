In mid-February of 2014, there was a traffic accident (a Changan Star rubbed against a Lexus, and no one was hurt, but the car's paint was scratched). The traffic police ruled that Zhou was at fault and he was given basic rest days on Saturday and Sunday, which totaled eight or nine days. I have checked my account, but it has been a month now and the compensation has not been received yet. When I call, they only say that it will be delivered as soon as possible.
