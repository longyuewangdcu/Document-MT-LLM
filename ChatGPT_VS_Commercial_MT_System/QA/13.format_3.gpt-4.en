In mid-February 2014, there was a traffic accident (a Chang'an Star scraped a Lexus; no one was hurt! Just the paint was scratched). The traffic police ruled a week, including Saturday and Sunday as two days off, which is basically eight or nine days. I checked my account! It's been a month now, and the insurance claim still hasn't been settled! When I called, they just said they would do it as soon as possible.
