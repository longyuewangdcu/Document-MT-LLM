In the middle of February 2014 this year, there was a traffic accident (Changan Star rubbed the Lexus, people are fine! Just the car scratched the paint), the traffic police awarded the week including Saturday and Sunday two rest days basically eight or nine days I checked the account! It's been a month now and the claim hasn't arrived yet! Call only said as soon as possible
