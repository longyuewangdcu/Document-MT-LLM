There was a traffic accident in mid -February this year (Changan Star was rubbed to Lexus, people were okay! But the car was painted). The traffic police sentenced the week to the two -day break on Saturday and Saturday. I checked the account!	 It's been a month now, and the claims have not yet arrived!	 Call only as soon as possible
