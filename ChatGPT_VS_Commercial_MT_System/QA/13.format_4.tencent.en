In the middle of February 2014, there was a traffic accident (Changan Star grazed Lexus, and the person was fine! It was just that the car scratched the paint). The traffic police sentenced me to eight or nine days, including two rest days on Saturday and Sunday. I checked my account! It has been a month now, and the claim has not been paid yet! I only called to say as soon as possible
