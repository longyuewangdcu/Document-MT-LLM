My Samsung Galaxy S3 unlocks with my password, but then it automatically locks again and repeats this process. I've tried turning it off and removing the battery, but it still happens. Have you tried flashing the firmware? It might be a software issue. Try doing a factory reset. You can search for how to do it on Baidu, and it should unlock your phone. So, do I need to flash the firmware? No, you don't need to flash it. A factory reset should work. You can search for how to do a factory reset on Baidu. You're welcome.
