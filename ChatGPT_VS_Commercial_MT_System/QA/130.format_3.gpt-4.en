Samsung Galaxy S3, after entering the unlock password, it automatically locks the screen again, and it keeps repeating this process. I've tried turning it off, removing the battery, and flashing the firmware. Is it a software issue? You can try doing a factory reset on your phone. Just search on Baidu, and you'll know how to unlock it. Does that mean I need to flash the firmware? No, you don't need to flash the firmware, just do a factory reset. Search on Baidu, and you'll know how to do it. Thank you.
