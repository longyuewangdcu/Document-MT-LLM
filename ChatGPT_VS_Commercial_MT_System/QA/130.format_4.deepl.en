Samsung Geisha III, after entering the unlock code to open it, it automatically locks the screen again, then enter the password again it automatically locks the screen, and so on and so forth. I've turned off the phone and removed the battery. That is the program has a problem. The phone double-clear bar, Baidu will know, you can unlock it. This means that you need to brush the machine? No, double-cleaning, not brushing. You will know how to double clean it with Baidu.
