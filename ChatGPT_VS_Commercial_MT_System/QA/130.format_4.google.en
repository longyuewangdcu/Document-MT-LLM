Samsung Ga Shi San, after entering the unlock password, it automatically locks the screen again, and then the password is automatically locks the screen, so repeated.	 Turn off the machine, have you butt the battery flashing?	 That's a problem with the program.	 Double the mobile phone, you will know at once, and you can unlock it.	 In other words, I want to brush the machine? No, Shuangqing, not flashing.	 You can know how to clear it, thank you
