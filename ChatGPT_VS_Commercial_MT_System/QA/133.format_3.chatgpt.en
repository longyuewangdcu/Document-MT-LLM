I am considering studying computer science as a graduate student, but my programming ability is not good. It doesn't matter which direction I choose because I will follow my supervisor's lead and work on whatever project they take on. Of course, some teachers do not take on many projects, so I won't have much to do if that's the case. No one has good programming ability naturally; it is improved by working on projects. Hey, but I saw information on information security and networks in the admission brochure, shouldn't I apply for those first? During my undergraduate years, I only worked on basic management software and similar projects. By the way, which school are you from? Let's exchange some ideas, hehe. I sent you a private message; I don't know if you received it.
