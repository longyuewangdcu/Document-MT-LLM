The postgraduate of the computer is examined, but the programming ability is not good. Because of the instructor, the instructor will do whatever items to take on whatever items. Of course, some teachers do not take the project much, so do not do it.	 No one has a good programming ability, and it is all improved by projects, but I checked what information security and the Internet in the enrollment seal, isn't it first pressed that registration?	 I basically only did any management software and the like at the undergraduate stage, and I haven't done it.	 And which school are you from, exchanges, hehe.	 I sent you a private message, I donâ€™t know if you received it
