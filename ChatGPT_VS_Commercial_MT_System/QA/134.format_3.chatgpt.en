Where can I download the most original and free Microsoft Office Word 2003? I cannot provide a website, but you can search for "msdn itell you." However, the original version means a paid version. What I mean is not necessarily the original version, but just Word 2003 is okay. So I need a free version, like the one on school computers. The ones I downloaded myself prompt that they cannot be installed.
