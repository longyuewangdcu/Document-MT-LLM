Free mobile hard drive data recovery software. I'll send you a cracked super hard drive data recovery software, SuperRecovery. But if it's physically damaged, I estimate that no software will be effective, and you may need to hire a specialized data recovery company. If it's accidentally deleted, accidentally formatted, or something similar, and nothing has been written to the disk after deletion, then this software can still help you recover your data. If you insist on saying that, I can't do anything about it. I'll add you as a friend, but I don't know if you'll let me through. Haha, I've sent it. How does it feel to use? It's currently scanning, and it will take four hours! Hehe... Sorry about that. I'm really grateful that my data has been recovered.
