Free mobile hard drive data recovery software: I'll send you a cracked version of the powerful data recovery software SuperRecovery. However, if it's physical damage, I guess no software would be effective, and you might need to ask for help from a specialized data recovery company. If it's accidental deletion, accidental formatting or something like that, and you haven't continued writing data after the deletion, then this software can still help you recover. If you say so, there's nothing I can do. I'll add you as a friend, but I don't know if you'll accept my request. Hehe. I've sent it. How does it feel to use it? Scanning will take four hours! Hehe... sorry about that. I'm truly grateful; all my data has been recovered.
