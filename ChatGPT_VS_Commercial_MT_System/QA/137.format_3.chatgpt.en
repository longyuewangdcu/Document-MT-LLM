How about this computer configuration? Experts, please advise what wattage the power supply should be. Generally speaking, the graphics card is dragging behind. If you want to play the latest large-scale 3D games, it is recommended to start with at least 8GB of memory and a 1080P display. Your current configuration should be fine with a 450W power supply rating. As for which graphics card to replace with, it depends on personal preference. The computer has not been assembled yet! Thank you, master! For a GTX 760 or 660ti, pay attention to the power supply. The price may increase by around 300 yuan!
