What's the configuration of this computer? Is it fast? I want to buy it urgently. Seeking advice from experts. If the price is not too expensive, I suggest not using the WIN8 system. The mid-to-high-end configuration should be fine for gaming, but Lenovo's system needs to be reinstalled. I want to play games. How about the 4699 barebone computer? What games are you planning to play? This machine may experience some lag while playing League of Legends, but it shouldn't be a big problem. What about CrossFire?
