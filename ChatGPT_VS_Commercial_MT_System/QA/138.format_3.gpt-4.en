How's the configuration of this computer? Is it fast? I urgently need to buy it. I'm seeking advice from experts. If the price is not too expensive, I suggest not using the WIN8 system. The mid-range configuration is sufficient for playing games, but the Lenovo system needs to be reinstalled.	I want to play games. How about the 4699 RMB barebone computer? What games do you want to play? This machine may experience a little lag when running League of Legends, but it shouldn't be a big problem. What about CF (CrossFire)?
