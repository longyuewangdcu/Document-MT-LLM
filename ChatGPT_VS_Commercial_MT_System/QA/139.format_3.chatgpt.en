How's the configuration of this computer? Is it fast? I want to buy it. Seeking expert advice. It's very powerful. How about playing games on it? This computer...I think it's good enough. The application memory is large, and the processor is also very powerful. I'm taking a picture, can you take a look for me? Sure. The configuration is good enough. Can it handle large games? Can it run the CF game? Can't use it up. I just bought a wireless network extender! But I don't know how to use it! Download the driver online! Then it will be okay. Is it a wireless network card driver? Yes, that's right!
