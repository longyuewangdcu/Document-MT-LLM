How is this computer's configuration? Speed, urgent... Should I buy it? Seeking expert advice... Very awesome. How about playing games on this computer? This computer... I think it's cool, with a large application memory and a very powerful processor. I'm taking a picture, could you help me take a look? Alright. The configuration is good, I think it's enough. Can it handle large-scale games? Can it run CF (CrossFire) game smoothly? Can't use it up. I just bought a wireless network extender! But I don't know how to use it! Download the driver online! Then it will be fine. Is it the wireless network card driver? Yes, yes!
