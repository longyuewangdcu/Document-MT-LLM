I want to change my graphics card and I'm looking for recommendations!!! Experts, please take a look at my computer's specs, my current graphics card is really bad. Especially looking for high-performance-to-price ratio CPU products. I suggest adding 4G of memory. I recommend the 660 and 7850 graphics cards, which have a good price-performance ratio. The 660 has about 15% higher performance than the 7850, but it is $200 more expensive. They are both compatible with my current setup and can handle mainstream games easily. The Sapphire HD7850 1G GDDR5 Platinum Edition is priced at ￥1099, and the Inno3D GTX660 Ice Dragon Edition is priced at ￥1299. Do you need to change anything else? No, there is no need to change anything else as it won't significantly improve the performance. If you feel that the loading speed of games or software is slow, you can consider adding a solid-state hard drive. Of course, your power supply should be rated at least 400W, otherwise, it can easily cause various errors, instability, and affect the hardware lifespan.
