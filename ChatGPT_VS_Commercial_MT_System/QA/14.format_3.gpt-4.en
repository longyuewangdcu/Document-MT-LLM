I want to change my graphics card, please recommend one!!! Experts, look at my setup. The current graphics card configuration is really useless. Everything is wrong, especially the CPU with high cost-performance ratio. It is recommended to add another 4G of memory. I recommend the 660 and 7850 graphics cards for their cost-performance ratio. The 660's performance is about 15% higher than the 7850, but the price is 200 higher. It's suitable for your configuration, and you can play mainstream games easily. Sapphire HD7850 1G GDDR5 Platinum Edition ￥1099. Inno3D GTX660 Ice Dragon Edition ￥1299. Is there anything else you want to change? You don't need to change anything else. It won't improve performance much. If you think the game or software loading speed is slow, you can consider adding a solid-state drive. Of course, your power supply should be at least 400W rated, otherwise, it can easily cause instability, various errors, and affect hardware life.
