I want to change a graphics card for recommendations! The expert look at my configuration configuration graphics card is really too chicken. Its all wrong. Especially CPU cost-effective products. Memory recommended to add another 4G. recommended on the 660 and 7850 graphics cards cost-effective now wrong. 660 performance than 7850 about 15% higher. Over the price of 200. with the right configuration. Mainstream games casually play. Sapphire HD7850 1G GDDR 5 Platinum Edition ¥ 1099 Inno3D GTX660 Ice Dragon Edition ¥ 1299 Other and to change? No need to change anything else. Not much of a performance boost. If you feel that the game or software loading speed is slow. You can consider adding a solid state drive. Of course, your power supply should be rated at least 400W. Otherwise, it is easy to cause instability and various errors. And affect the life of the hardware
