I want to change the graphics card for recommendation!!! Master see my configuration configuration graphics card really too tasteless. Its wrong. Special CPU cost-effective products. Memory recommendations plus 4G. Recommended on the 660 and 7850 graphics card cost-effective is now wrong. 660 performance is about 15% higher than 7850. Over the price of 200. With the appropriate configuration. Mainstream games to play casually.Sapphire HD7850 1G GDDR 5 Platinum Edition￥1099 Inno3D GTX660 Ice Dragon Edition￥1299 Other do you want to change? Other do not need to change. No improvement in performance. If you think the game or software loading speed is slow. You can consider adding a solid state drive. Of course, your power supply should be at least rated 400W. Otherwise it is easy to cause instability and various errors. And affect the hardware life
