How to add a hard drive to the IBM x3650 server? The prerequisite is that you are familiar with ServeRAID Manager or can enter the RAID configuration interface (Ctrl+A) when the machine starts up. For this model of machine, the hard drive must be configured by the RAID card before it can be recognized by the operating system. Therefore, the newly added hard drive must be an Array or a Simple Volume. The newly added disk cannot be added to an existing Array and can only generate a new Array or Simple Volume. So you need to use ServeRAID Manager or enter the RAID card by pressing Ctrl+A during startup to create a new Array or Simple Volume. After that, use the "rescan disk" option in the operating system's disk management to discover the hard drive, partition, format, assign a drive letter, and then it can be used. The machine model number is MT: 7979 and you cannot simply open the box and connect a hard drive. There are six 3.5-inch or 2.5-inch drive bays and a DDS4 tape drive at the front of the machine. Remove the bays that are not installed with hard drives, insert the new hard drive, and no data cables need to be connected.
