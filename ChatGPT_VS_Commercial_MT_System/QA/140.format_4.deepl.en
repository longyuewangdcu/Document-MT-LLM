How to add hard disks to the IBM x3650 server Prerequisite: You can play with ServeRAID Manager or enter the RAID configuration interface (Ctrl+A) when the machine boots up. For this model of machine, the hard disk must be configured by the RAID card before it can be recognized by the operating system, so the newly added disk must be an Array or a simple volume. Newly added disks cannot be added to existing Arrays, only new Arrays or simple volumes can be generated. So you need to use ServeRAID Manager or boot Ctrl+A to enter the RAID card to create a new Array or simple volume, and then 'rescan the disk' in the operating system hard disk management to discover the disk, partition it, format it, and label it with the volume, and it will be ready for use. Machine identification is MT: 7979 can not be directly out of the box, connected to the hard drive? You said the trouble is not, have not tried to add hard disk to the server themselves There are six 3.5-inch or six 2.5-inch and a dds4 tape drive in front of the machine, you take off the plug in the location where the hard disk is not installed, plug the new hard disk on it, there is no data cable needs to be connected.
