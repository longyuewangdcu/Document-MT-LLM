How to make a hard disk with the IBM X3650 server, you play the Serveraid Manager or enter the RAID configuration interface (CTRL+A) when the machine starts.	 In this model, the hard disk must be configured by the RAID card to be recognized by the operating system, so the newly added hard disk must be Array or simple volume.	 The newly added disk cannot be added to the existing Array, and it can only generate new Array or simple rolls.	 So you need to use the ServerAID Manager or turn on Ctrl+A to enter the RAID card to create a new Array or simple volume, and then discover the hard disk, partition, formatting at the operating system hard disk management 're -scan the disk'.	 They use.	 The machine logo is MT: 7979 cannot open the box, do you pick up the hard disk?	 You are not in trouble. I haven't tried to add 6 3.5 -inch or 6 2.5 -inch and a DDS4 tape machine in front of the server to add a hard disk machine.	 It's okay, no data cable needs to be connected.
