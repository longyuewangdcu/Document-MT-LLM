The best art class for the college entrance examination in Shanghai, it would be great to go to Beijing. I am from Shanghai and currently in my second year of junior high school. Are you in your second year of junior high school or senior high school? Why are you thinking about it so early? If you wait until senior high school to start learning, it will be too late. Should we go to Beijing to study then? I want to study in Shanghai, but I still have to finish my studies.
