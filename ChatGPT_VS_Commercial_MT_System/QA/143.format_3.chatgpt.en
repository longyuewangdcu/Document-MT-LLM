Remote monitoring setup for Dahua DVR. I use it for my company. First, I need to turn on the network function of the Dahua DVR and test it within the LAN to see if it can be accessed. Then, I need to set up the DMZ host in the router and fill in the DVR's internal IP address. Finally, I need to turn on the domain name function of the router. TP's router has this function (Peanut Shell). If not, try updating the router firmware on the TP website. Our company did not originally have this function, but we updated it later. Of course, we still need to apply for our own domain name. If the LAN is accessible, I followed your instructions and applied for a domain name. But I don't know what to input when accessing it from outside the LAN. Have you bound the domain name with the DMZ host (i.e., the internal IP address of your DVR) in the router? If it's done, you can directly access your DVR using the domain name from outside the LAN. I have completed all the settings, but I can't access the webpage by entering the URL at home. Is this the correct way? My Peanut Shell domain name is the URL. When using my phone, there are sudden stripes and then a black screen. The stripes have appeared in various colors. The screen is either broken or loose inside. Diagnosis complete. Is it not a problem with the ribbon cable?
