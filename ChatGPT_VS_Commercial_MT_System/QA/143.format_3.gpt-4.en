"DaHua hard disk recorder remote monitoring setup: I used it like this for my company. First, turn on the network function of the DaHua recorder and test it within the local area network (LAN) to see if it is visible. Then, set up the DMZ host in the router and fill in the internal IP of the recorder. Finally, turn on the domain name function of the router - TP routers have this feature (Peanut Shell). If not, please try updating the router firmware version on the TP website... Our company's router originally didn't have this feature, but after updating, it did... Of course, you still need to apply for a domain name yourself. I can see it on the LAN, and I followed your instructions for the rest, including applying for a domain name. But I don't know what to enter when I access it from the external network. Have you bound the domain name and DMZ host (which is your recorder's internal IP) in the router? If you have, you can directly enter the domain name in the external network to browse your recorder. I've set everything up, but when I enter the website address at home, the page cannot be displayed. I'm not sure if this is the case - my Peanut Shell domain name is this website address. My phone suddenly displayed stripes and then went black. The stripes also appeared in various colors. The screen is either broken or the internal screen is loose, assessment complete. Could it not be a problem with the ribbon cable?"
