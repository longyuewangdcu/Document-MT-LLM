Dahua DVR remote monitoring settings I use the company 's first Dahua DVR network function open, try to see if you can see inside the local area network, and then set the DMZ host inside the router to fill in the video recorder' s intranet IP, and finally open the router 's domain name function TP router has this function(Peanut shell), if not, please go to the TP website to try to update the routing firmware version ... Our company did not have this feature originally, and later after the update there ... Of course, the domain name or to apply for their own LAN can be seen, the latter I am in accordance with what you said to do, also applied for a domain name, the question I go to the external network input what,I don 't know.
