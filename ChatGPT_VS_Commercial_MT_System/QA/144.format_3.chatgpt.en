Does anyone have the touchpad driver for HP G4-2136TX with Win7 32-bit system, the kind that can lock the touchpad by pressing the groove? The computer should have come with a driver disc for you, right? No, I replaced the system myself and don't have it anymore. You can try to find the driver on the HP official website.
