Who has the touchpad driver for HP G4-2136 TX with a Win7 32-bit system, the one that allows you to lock the touchpad by pressing the groove? The computer should have come with a driver disc, right? I don't have it, I changed the system myself. Try looking for the driver on the HP official website.
