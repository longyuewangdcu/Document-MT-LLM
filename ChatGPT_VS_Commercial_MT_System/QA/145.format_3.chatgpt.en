What is the approximate price for a second-hand laptop like this? It can probably sell for around 3000. I've been using it for two years, it's already out of warranty, but the appearance is relatively new, and the machine has an aluminum alloy shell. Can it be sold for 3500? Maybe it can only sell for 3000.
