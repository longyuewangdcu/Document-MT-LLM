The Shanghai Bell RG2210-CA fiber optic modem of China Telecom, I want to find the administrator password so that I can set the modem to dial automatically. The home wifi router network is unstable, I used to think it was a problem with the router, so I bought a new one, but the network is still unstable. You should contact the service provider to completely solve the problem, as this involves the network cable of your router and the server responsible for your area. I contacted the service provider, but they said that as long as I can access the Internet, it is not within their jurisdiction, and told me to contact the router seller. I have tried several routers, but the problem persists. You should check if your computer or router has set any scheduled tasks. I haven't set any scheduled tasks. Has anyone else made any changes? No. I just called the service provider at 10000, and they said my network is normal.
