Telecommunication Shanghai Bell RG2210-CA optical fiber modem. I want to find the administrator password to set up the modem for automatic dialing. My home Wi-Fi router network is unstable. I always thought it was a problem with the router, so I bought a new one, but the network is still unstable. However, you should contact the service provider to completely solve the problem. This involves issues with your home router network cable and the server responsible for your area. I contacted the service provider, and they said that as long as I can access the internet, it's not within their jurisdiction and told me to contact the router seller. I've tried several routers, and they all have the same problem. First, check if your computer or router has set any timers. I don't think so. I never set timers. Has anyone else touched it? No. I just called the 10000 number, and they also said that my network is normal.
