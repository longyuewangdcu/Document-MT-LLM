The wifi router network at home is unstable. I used to think it was a problem with the router, so I bought a new one, but the network is still unstable. It's possible that there is a problem with your line. You should call the service provider to upgrade to fiber broadband. When it was set up, it seemed like nothing needed to be entered and you could connect to the internet directly. Upgraded to fiber? Enter the router interface setup wizard, select static IP, and enter the IP provided by the service provider and other information. They didn't provide me with any of this information. Alright then, I'm off.
