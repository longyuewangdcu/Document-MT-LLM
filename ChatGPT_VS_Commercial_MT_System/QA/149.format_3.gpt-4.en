The Wi-Fi router at home has an unstable connection. I initially thought it was a router issue, so I bought a new one, but the network is still unstable. It might be a problem with your line; you should call the service provider. This is an upgrade to fiber-optic broadband. It seems that nothing needed to be input when setting it up; just directly connect to go online. An upgraded fiber? Go to the router interface and set up a static IP, filling in the IP and other information provided by the service provider. They haven't provided me with any of this related information before. They just left after it was done.
