The WiFi router at home is not stable. I thought it was a router problem before, so I bought a new one. Then the network is still unstable, but it may be a problem with your line. Call the operator. This is a broadband upgrade fiber. It seems that when you set it up, you don't need to enter anything. You can directly connect to the upgraded fiber to access the Internet. Go to the router interface setup wizard, select the static IP and fill in the IP given to you by the operator and others.I haven 't been provided with these related things. OK, I'll leave
