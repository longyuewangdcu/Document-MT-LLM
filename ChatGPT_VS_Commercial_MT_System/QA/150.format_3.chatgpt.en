The Wi-Fi router network at home is unstable. Previously, I thought it was a problem with the router, so I bought a new one, but the network is still unstable. Could someone be using our network without permission? It's unlikely because the password is quite complex. It might be an issue with the Ethernet cable or the internet service provider.
