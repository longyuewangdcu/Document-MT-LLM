The Wi-Fi router at home is unstable, and I previously thought it was a problem with the router, so I bought a new one. However, the network is still unstable. Could it be that someone is using my Wi-Fi? It shouldn't be, as the password is quite complicated. Oh, then it must be a problem with the Ethernet cable or the service provider.
