Begging for a master in antivirus software. Nowadays, many antivirus software automatically push virus library updates, such as NOD32, Kaspersky, etc. Just set it to update automatically. Master: What I mean is that the banking industry uses a LAN, and my idea is to push updates directly to each terminal through the server-side without requiring terminal personnel to operate. This saves a lot of manpower and material resources, and there is no feasible way without client-side operations. Please take a look at my computer configuration and recommend an upgrade around 1000 yuan. Upgrading the CPU on the original motherboard may not bring a qualitative leap. I am considering: 1. Upgrading to an I5 3470 + 250 yuan H61 motherboard for a total of 1300 yuan, and then upgrading to a better graphics card to achieve a mid-to-high-end configuration. 2. Upgrading to an I3 3240 + B75 motherboard for a total of 1000 yuan, and then upgrading the graphics card later. Will simply changing the graphics card have no effect? If you want to change the motherboard, isn't it better to just buy a new computer? How to repair disk recovery sectors? If you only need to repair disk recovery sectors, you can use the system's built-in disk tool to repair it. If that doesn't work, you can use partition software to organize the disk partition. If you need to retrieve data, you need to use a data recovery software such as "DataExplore Data Recovery" or "Data Recovery Master" to recover the data first, and then perform disk processing.
