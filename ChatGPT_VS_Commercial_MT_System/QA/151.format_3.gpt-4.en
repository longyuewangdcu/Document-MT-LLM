Begging for antivirus software experts: Nowadays, many antivirus software automatically push virus database updates, such as NOD32, Kaspersky, etc. Just set it to auto-update. Expert: What I mean is that banks use local area networks, and my idea is to push updates directly to each person's terminal through the server side, without the need for the terminal staff to operate, thus saving a lot of manpower and resources. Is there no feasible method that doesn't require client-side operations? Please check my computer configuration; I want to upgrade it with around 1,000 RMB. If I upgrade the CPU on the original motherboard, it won't bring a qualitative leap, so I'm considering: 1. Upgrading to an i5 3470 + a 250 RMB H61 motherboard for a total of 1,300 RMB, and then add a better graphics card to achieve a mid-to-high-end configuration. 2. Upgrading to an i3 3240 + a B75 motherboard for a total of 1,000 RMB, and then add a graphics card. Will merely replacing the graphics card not have any effect? If I change the motherboard, is it better to buy a new computer altogether? How can I repair the disk recovery sector? If you only need to repair the disk recovery sector, you can use the built-in disk tool in the system. If that doesn't work, you can use partition software to organize the disk partition. If you need to recover data, you'll need to use data recovery software like "DataExplore Data Recovery," "Data Recovery Master," and similar software to recover the data first, then process the disk.
