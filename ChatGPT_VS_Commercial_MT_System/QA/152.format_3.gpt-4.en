Asking for guidance from experts, regarding problems in online marketing thesis about Jumei Youpin. What are the problems, and what are the corresponding strategies? I have done a thesis on online marketing and Jumei Youpin, I can help you. So, what problems does Jumei Youpin have? What countermeasures can be taken for these problems? Last year, someone in the forum told me it was from the Tang Dynasty, and this year, someone told me it was probably from the Han-Jin period. I am seeking an expert to estimate and give me a rough price. Isn't there a CCTV program specifically for this? It's such a hassle, now all the shows are just for show! I mainly want to get an idea of its value beforehand. I don't know much about this, as my family doesn't have any antiques. You can try calling 114 and ask if there are any expert hotlines for this!
