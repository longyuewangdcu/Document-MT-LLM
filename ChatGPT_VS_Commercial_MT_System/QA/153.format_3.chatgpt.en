My laptop has a Windows 8 operating system with one partition. Please teach me how to divide it into four and install a Windows 7 operating system using a system disk. It's too much to type out, so add me on QQ and I'll teach you step by step. Do I have to charge you for it? I'm confused, I'll teach you for free.
