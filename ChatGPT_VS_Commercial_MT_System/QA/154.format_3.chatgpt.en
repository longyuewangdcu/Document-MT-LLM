What is being sold on JD.com, Swarovski, is it really priced at just over 700 yuan? Can we trust buying from JD.com? Swarovski's products are all made of valuable crystal glass and are designed and crafted by designers. Remember, all Swarovski products are made of glass. I want to buy a birthday gift for my sister for under 1000 yuan. Do you have any good recommendations, such as necklaces, bracelets, pendants, and so on?
