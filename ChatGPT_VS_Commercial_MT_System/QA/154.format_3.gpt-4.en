The Swarovski sold at Jingdong Mall is only over 700, is it real? Is it guaranteed to buy on Jingdong? Swarovski products are all made of glass, and the value comes from the designer's inspiration and craftsmanship in creating crystal pieces. Remember, all Swarovski products are made of glass. I want to buy a birthday gift for my sister, within 1,000, any good recommendations for necklaces, bracelets, or pendants?
