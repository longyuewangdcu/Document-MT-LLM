Is it true that Swarovski sold on JD.com is only a little over 700 yuan? Can I trust buying it on JD.com? Swarovski is just a stone, so on JD.com, it can only be said that it is more authentic than on another platform. I want to buy a birthday gift for my sister for under 1000 yuan. Do you have any good recommendations for necklaces, bracelets, pendants, and the like? Gold prices have dropped now. You can buy a gold pendant or something like that by going to the mall. It's high-end and classy. Even with the price drop, it's still not exactly cheap...
