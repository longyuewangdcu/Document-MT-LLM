The Swarovski sold in Jingdong Mall is just over 700, is it real? Is it guaranteed to be authentic if I buy it on Jingdong? Swarovski is just a stone, the authenticity on Jingdong can only be said to be better than on certain other platforms. I want to buy a birthday gift for my sister, within 1000, any good recommendations, like necklaces, bracelets, or pendants? The price of gold has dropped now, you can buy her a gold pendant or something similar, go to the mall to buy it, it's more upscale. Even with the price drop, it's not cheap... It's not cheap either...
