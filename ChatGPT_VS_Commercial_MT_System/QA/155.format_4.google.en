Swarovski sold by Jingdong Mall is only more than 700. Is it true?	 Is JD.com buying insurance?	 Swarovski is just a stone. Hey, JD.com can only be said to be more authentic than a certain treasure.	 I want to buy a birthday gift for my sister, within 1000, what are the good introduction, necklace bracelets, pendants and the like now, the price is reduced, you can buy a gold pendant or the like, go to the mall to buy it.	 It is cheap ... it is not cheap ...
