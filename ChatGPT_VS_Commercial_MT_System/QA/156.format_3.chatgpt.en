Did the disk create an extra partition? How do I merge it? What tool should I use? I have been using Acronis Disk Director Suite, a non-destructive partitioning tool for 34 years. I have helped my friends partition XP, Vista, and Win7, and it also has a merge function for non-destructive partitioning. I used to use Partition Magic, but I switched to Acronis Disk Director Suite because it is better. Is this Chinese difficult to learn? I want to evenly merge the extra partition with the other four partitions. I used to use English, but I now use the Chinese version because it has a graphical interface, and you can perform the operation first and then apply it. You need to restart the computer, and be careful not to power it off during the process, or you may lose data. It is no problem to evenly distribute the extra partition to the other partitions, you just need to divide it by yourself. For example, if you have 10G, you can divide it into 2.5G for each partition. The graphical interface is very clear and easy to understand. I personally recommend that you first install a virtual machine, practice partitioning on it, and then operate on the real machine. Safety comes first. Download and try it out first.
