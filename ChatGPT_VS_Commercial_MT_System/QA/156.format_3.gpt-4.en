The disk has an extra partition? How do I merge it? What tool should I use? I've been using Acronis Disk Director Suite, a non-destructive partitioning tool, for 34 years. I've helped friends partition XP, Vista, and Win7. It also has a merge function and non-destructive partitioning features. I used to use Partition Magic before switching to Acronis Disk Director Suite because it's better. Is it available in Chinese? Is it difficult to learn? I want to merge the extra partition and evenly distribute it among the other four partitions.	It used to be in English, and I prefer using the English version as it's more stable. There's a Chinese version too, but I'm worried about issues arising from using a localized version. If partitioning is not done correctly, data might be lost. By now, there should be a Chinese version available. It has a graphical interface, and you can perform the operations first. Once you see the partitions meet your requirements, click Apply, and the partitioning will start. You'll need to restart the computer, and then wait. Be careful not to lose power, or you'll run into big problems. Distributing the space evenly among other partitions is not an issue; you just need to do the division yourself. For example, if you have 10GB, you can allocate 2.5GB to each partition. The graphical interface is quite clear.	I personally recommend that you first install a virtual machine and practice partitioning on the virtual machine. Once you're familiar with the process, you can proceed with the actual operation, as safety comes first. First, download one to give it a try.
