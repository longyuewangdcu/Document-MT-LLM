The disk has an extra partition? How do I merge it? What tool to use Acronis Disk Director Suite tool lossless partitioning tool I have used for 34 years to help friends divided XP Vista, win7 inside also with merge function lossless partitioning features before using multi-partition wizard over with Acronis Disk Director Suite more because better ~ Oh please is Chinese? Is it hard to learn? I want to merge the extra disk to the other four disks equally? The previous English, I also like to use the English, more stable, there are Chinese, afraid of problems, partitioning is not good to lose data, now there should be a Chinese version of the graphical interface, you can first operate, see the partition to meet your requirements, and then point application, will be partitioned, is to reboot Oh, then it is waiting, pay attention to the computer do not power off, otherwise the trouble is big Oh. The average partition to other disks is no problem, is that you want to divide it, for example, you are 10G, divided to each area 2.5G, the graphical interface is still very clear to see, personally recommend that you first install a virtual machine, the virtual machine partition practice, familiar with the operation, safety first well Try downloading one first
