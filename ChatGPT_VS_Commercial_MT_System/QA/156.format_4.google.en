Is the disk a district more?	 How to merge?	 What tools do you use to use Acronis Disk Director Suite tools without loss of partitioning tools. I have used it for 34 years. I have helped my friends to divide XP Vista and Win7. It also has a multi -zone magician with a multi -zone magician.	 Better ~ Haha, is it Chinese?	 Is it difficult to learn?	 I want to merge the more disk to the other four disks?	 I used to be English. I also like to use English, stable, Chinese, and afraid of problems. If the partition is not good, you will lose data. Now there should be a Chinese version.	 The partition meets the requirements you want, and then the application will be restarted. Then you have to wait. Pay attention to the computer to disconnect, otherwise the trouble will be great.	 The average distribution to other disks is okay, that is, you have to remove it yourself. For example, if you are 10G, you will be distributed to 2.5g in each district.	 The machine is partitioned in the virtual machine, and then operates after being familiar with. Try it first
