Acronis Disk Director Suite is a non-destructive partitioning tool. It has been used for 34 years. It has been used by my friends for XP Vista and win7. It also has the function of merging non-destructive partitions. It is better to use Acronis Disk Director Suite.I also like to use English, more stable, there are Chinese, afraid of problems, partition do not lose data, and now there should be a Chinese version, is a graphical interface, you can operate first, see the partition to meet the requirements you want, and then point the application, will partition, is to restart Oh, and then is waiting, pay attention to the computer do not power off, otherwise the trouble is big Oh.For example, if you are 10G, you will be assigned to each area of 2.5 G. The graphical interface is still very clear. Personally, I recommend that you first install a virtual machine, partition the virtual machine for practice, and then operate after familiarity. Safety first Try downloading one first
