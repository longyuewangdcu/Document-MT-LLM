The opening speed of Office Excel is slow. It's slow to open large files. Haha, if it works well on another computer, it means that the computer's software has Office compatibility. The main thing to check is the antivirus software. Some antivirus software may have different compatibility with Office, haha. Currently, everyone's computer seems to have this problem, so it shouldn't be a hardware issue. Or, I feel that the long opening time may be related to the Print Spooler service, but I'm not sure how to configure it. I tried using WPS and it opened much faster. However, the tables themselves are quite complicated and the compatibility between WPS and Office is not perfect. After editing in WPS and transferring back to Office, there may be formatting errors that need to be fixed. If possible, adding an SSD solid-state drive can greatly improve the overall speed of the computer.
