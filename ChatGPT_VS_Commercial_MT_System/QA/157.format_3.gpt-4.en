The office Excel opens slowly, seeking solutions. Large files are naturally slow. It's not a problem on other computers, which indicates that the computer has software compatible with Office. Mainly check the antivirus software, as some antivirus software has compatibility issues with Office. Now, this problem occurs on everyone's computer, so it should not be related to the configuration. Or, I feel that the long opening time may be related to the Print Spooler service, but I'm not sure how to configure it. Also, using WPS to open the file is much faster, but the compatibility between WPS and Office is not perfect, especially for complex spreadsheets. After editing with WPS and transferring back to Office, there may be formatting errors or even the need for repairs. If possible, add an SSD solid-state drive, which can greatly improve the overall running speed of the machine.
