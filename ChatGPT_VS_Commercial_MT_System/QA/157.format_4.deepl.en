office EXCEL slow open speed, please solve the file large originally slow ~ Oh to don't machine no problem that the computer installed software has office compatible ~ the main look at the antivirus ~ and others have a difference some antivirus software to office compatible huh ^_^ Now is everyone's computer has this problem, should not be configuration relationship. Or I feel that the open time is too long and Print Spooler service has some relationship. But not sure how it should be configured. Also tried to use WPS large meeting much faster. But the form itself is more complex, WPS and OFFICE is not perfect for the dual-use type. After editing with WPS and then transfer back to office will have formatting errors or even need to be repaired. If possible, add a SSD fixed hard disk, you can greatly improve the speed of the whole machine.
