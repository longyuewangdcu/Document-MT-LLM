Office EXCEL open slow, solve the file is slow ~ Oh, do not machine no problem that the computer software is compatible with office ~ mainly look at anti-virus software ~ and others are different from some anti-virus software compatible with office Oh ^_^Now everyone 's computer has this problem,I don't think it 's a configuration problem. Or I think it takes too long to open and the Print Spooler service has something to do with it. But I' m not sure how to configure it. In addition, I tried to use WPS to hold a big meeting much faster. But the form itself is more complicated, and the combination of WPS and OFFICE is not perfect. There will be format errors or even need to be repaired after editing it in WPS and then returning it to office. If possible, adding a SSD fixed hard disk can greatly improve the running speed of the whole machine.
