The speed of opening office EXCEL is slow, so I'm considering either reinstalling the system or using a smaller system since the software has been reinstalled. The hard disk is an SSD, so the speed should be sufficient. I don't understand why disabling the Print Spooler solves the problem. How can I solve the issue of being unable to access local disk E? I tried changing permissions with a superuser account, but even after changing the permissions with my administrator account, the problem persists. It has been resolved now, so I will give you some points.
