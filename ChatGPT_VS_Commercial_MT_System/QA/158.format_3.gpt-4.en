The office Excel opens slowly, seeking a solution. It might be due to a large file or the system. The system and software have been freshly reinstalled. The hard drive is an SSD, so the speed should be sufficient. What I don't understand is why disabling the Print Spooler resolves the issue. How can I solve the problem of not being able to access the local disk E? It might be a permission issue. Try entering the disk with superuser permissions and modify the permissions. I am the administrator, but even after modifying the permissions, the problem persists. It has been resolved, so I'll give you some points.
