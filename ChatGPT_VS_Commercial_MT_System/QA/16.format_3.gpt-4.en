I want to know what face shape I have? What kind of hairstyle should I have? Can anyone tell me, thank you. I feel like I look pretty good now, but a middle part with big curls might look even better. I've thought about it, but wouldn't a middle part be too mature? I think you are more suited for a middle part.
