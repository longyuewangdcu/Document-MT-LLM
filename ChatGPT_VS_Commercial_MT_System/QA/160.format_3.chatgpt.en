What technology in Java, jQuery or JavaScript can achieve this function? I would be grateful. On the right-hand side, there is a list of search results. How can I select a name from the list and fill it into that box by clicking a button? Both the left and right sides are iframes. Okay, can anyone tell me a few good websites to watch mobile phone videos online? Thank you. I couldn't access 84dddd.com, and it showed me 731 instead. I searched for it on QQ browser.
