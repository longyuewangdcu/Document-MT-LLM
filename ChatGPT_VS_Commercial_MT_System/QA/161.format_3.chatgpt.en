When the router disconnects from the internet, unplug the network cable from the router, plug it directly into the computer, and test the connection. If it works, the problem is with the router. Cut off the power to the router, reconnect the power and restart the network, and the problem should be fixed. The router often disconnects from the internet due to quality issues, but generally it is stable. My router is several years old and has only disconnected once. I use a "Swift" wireless router for home use, which costs 90 yuan. Try my method and hopefully it will be helpful. I have also experienced this issue in the past few days, so you should test it first by directly dialing without the router. If it doesn't work, it's an issue with the service provider, not the router. You won't know until you try it.
