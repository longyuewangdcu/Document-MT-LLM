When the router is disconnected from the internet, first unplug the network cable from the router and plug it directly into the computer to test if you can access the internet by dialing up. If you can, it's a problem with the router. Disconnect the router's power, reconnect it, and restart the network. If there are no issues with the network and the router frequently disconnects, it may be a quality issue with the router. It's better to get a more stable one. My router has only been disconnected once in a year. I use a Swift wireless router for home use, which costs 90 yuan. You can try my method and I hope it helps. My router has also been disconnecting frequently these past few days, but it didn't used to do that. I have encountered this situation before, so you need to test it according to my method and see if you can access the internet without the router by direct dialing. If you cannot, it's a problem with the internet service provider, not the router. You have to test it to find out.
