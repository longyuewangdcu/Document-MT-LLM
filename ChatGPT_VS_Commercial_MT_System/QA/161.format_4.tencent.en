The router is disconnected from the network. First unplug the router into the network cable and plug it directly into the computer to test whether you can dial the Internet. The router problem is to power off the router and then connect the power to restart the network. No problem. The router is often disconnected from the network. The quality problem of the router is better. It is relatively stable. My router has been disconnected for years. I used the fast wireless router for home use. It costs 90 yuan. Hehe. Try it according to my method. I hope it will help me. This is also the two days. It has been broken before. I have encountered this situation.So you have to test my method, do not have a router to dial directly whether the Internet. If not, the operator's problem is not the router's problem, you must try to know.
