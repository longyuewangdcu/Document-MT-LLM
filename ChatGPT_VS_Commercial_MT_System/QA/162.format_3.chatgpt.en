The router has lost its internet connection. Access the router interface, go to "Network Parameters," then "WAN Port Settings," and choose "Automatic Connection," then click "Save." It should always be set to automatic connection. The screenshot you showed indicates on-demand connection, which refreshes every 5 seconds. If you didn't send the wrong screenshot, follow the steps I've given you: Network Parameters > WAN Port Settings > MAC Address Cloning > Clone MAC Address > WAN Port Settings > Choose "Automatic Connection" > Click "Save."
