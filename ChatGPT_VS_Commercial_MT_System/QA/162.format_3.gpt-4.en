The router is disconnected. Go to the router interface - Network Parameters - WAN Port Settings - select "Automatic Connection" and click Save. It has always been set to automatic connection. Your screenshot clearly shows "connect on demand." The screenshot refreshes every 5 seconds. If you didn't send the wrong screenshot, then follow the steps I provided: Network Parameters - WAN Port Settings - MAC Address Cloning - Clone MAC Address - Network Parameters - WAN Port Settings - select "Automatic Connection" and click Save.
