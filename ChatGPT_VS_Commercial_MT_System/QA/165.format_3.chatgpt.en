I withdrew 1200 yuan from the Bank of Communications today. When do I need to repay the credit card cash advance? Your credit card has billing and repayment dates, and they are all different. As long as you repay before the due date, it's okay! Hope you can adopt this suggestion! Yes, you can withdraw cash with your credit card. I don't know the exact date. Please call customer service to avoid missing the repayment date!
