I withdrew 1,200 yuan from Bank of Communications today. When do I need to repay the cash advance on my credit card? Your credit card has a billing date and a repayment date, both of which vary. As long as you repay before the repayment period, it's fine! I hope this helps! Yes, it's a cash advance on a credit card. I don't know the date. You should call customer service to ask, so you don't miss the repayment date!
