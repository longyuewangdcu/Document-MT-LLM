I withdrew $1,200 from Bank of Communications today, when do I have to pay it back? Your credit card has a bill date and a payment date, each is different, as long as you pay it before the payment date! I hope you'll take it! Yes, credit card withdrawals. I don't know what the date is. Call customer service and ask, to avoid missing the repayment date!
