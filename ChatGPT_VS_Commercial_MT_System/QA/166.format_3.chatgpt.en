What's wrong with my computer that it can't connect to the router? It doesn't work when it gets to the step of automatically obtaining an IP address. It just can't automatically obtain it. The system is W7. Are you sure you didn't plug in the wrong cable? Maybe you switched the cable for the modem and the router. Let me try swapping them out. Thank you. Let me explain it to you. You don't need to plug in the modem cable, just connect to the router, and make sure the router is turned on. Then it should be able to automatically obtain the IP address. Follow the instructions, plug in the cables correctly, and restore the router to its factory settings to solve the problem. Remember, you must plug in the cables correctly.
