My computer cannot connect to the router, what's the problem? It doesn't work when it comes to automatically obtaining the IP address. It always fails to obtain automatically. My system is Windows 7. Are you sure you haven't plugged the wires incorrectly? Maybe you've reversed the modem's wire with the router's wire. I'll try switching them back and forth. Thank you. Let me put it this way: you don't need to plug in the modem's wire; as long as you have connected the router and the router is turned on, it should automatically obtain the IP. Follow the instructions to plug in the wires properly and then reset the router to factory settings to resolve the issue. Remember, the wires must be plugged in correctly.
