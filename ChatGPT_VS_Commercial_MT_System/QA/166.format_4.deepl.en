What's wrong with my computer not being able to connect to the router? It doesn't work when I get to the step of getting an IP address automatically. It always fails to get it automatically. The system is W7 Are you sure you're not plugging in the wrong cable? I'm sure you're not plugging in the wrong cable? I'll try switching back and forth. Thank you... The first thing you need to do is to get the right cable and then restore the router to its factory settings. Remember, the line must be inserted right.
