What's wrong with my computer?	 It is not possible to automatically obtain the IP address.	 Essence	 Can't always get it automatically.	 Essence	 The system is W7, do you determine that you have not inserted the wrong line? Put the cat's line and insert the line of the router.	 I try it back and forth.	 Essence	 Thank you dear .. I said that, you do nâ€™t need to insert the cable of the cat. As long as you connect the router, and the router is opened, you can automatically obtain the IP.	 You can insert the line according to the instructions, and then restore the router to the factory settings.	 Remember, the line must be inserted.
