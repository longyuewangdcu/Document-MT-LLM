My computer can not connect to the router is how? To automatically get the IP address that step will not work .. Always can not automatically get .. System is W7 Are you sure you are not plugged in the wrong line? The cat line, and the router line is plugged in the wrong bar. I try to switch back and forth .. Thank you dear .. I say this, you do not need to plug in the cat line, you just connect the router, and the router is turned on, then can automatically get the IP. You follow the instructions, to plug the line,Then restore the router factory settings can be resolved. Remember, the line must be plugged in.
