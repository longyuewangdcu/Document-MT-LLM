What's wrong with my computer that it can't connect to the router? It fails to automatically obtain an IP address. It always fails to automatically obtain it. The system is W7. Check if other devices, such as a phone, can detect and use the router. If there are no other devices, restart the router. That means unplugging and plugging in the router's power and then trying again. (This situation is more common.) The phone can detect it, but it can't be used normally. Then, try restarting the router. Also, does your router have an internet connection? In other words, have you set up an internet account? It seems like I haven't. How do you connect to the internet then? If it's a newly purchased router, you can't connect to the internet without setting up a dial-up connection in the router. Okay, thank you. I'll try it out. If I don't understand anything, I'll ask you again. Sure, if you don't know how to set it up, you can refer to the manual or call customer service. Don't worry too much. Once you do it once, you'll understand how to do it.
