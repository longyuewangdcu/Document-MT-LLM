My computer cannot connect to the router, what's the problem? It doesn't work when it comes to automatically obtaining the IP address. It always fails to obtain automatically. My system is Windows 7. Try using another device, such as a phone, to see if it can detect and use the network. If you don't have another device, restart the router. That is, unplug and plug the router's power back in and try again (this situation is quite common). My phone can detect the network, but it cannot be used properly. In that case, try restarting the router, and also, is your router connected to the internet? In other words, have you set up the internet account? It seems like I haven't. How do you go online then? If it's a newly purchased router, you won't be able to access the internet without setting up a dial-up connection in the router. Alright, thank you. I'll try again. If I don't understand something, I'll ask you again, okay? Sure, if you don't know how to set it up, you can refer to the instruction manual or call customer service. Don't worry too much. Once you set it up, you'll know how to do it.
