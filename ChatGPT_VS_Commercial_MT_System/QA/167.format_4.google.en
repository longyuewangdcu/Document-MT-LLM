What's wrong with my computer?	 It is not possible to automatically obtain the IP address.	 Essence	 Can't always get it automatically.	 Essence	 The system is W7 to see if other devices are used, such as whether mobile phones can be found and used.	 If there are no other devices, restart the router.	 That is, pull out the power of the router and try it.	 (This situation is more common) mobile phones can be found.	 Essence	 But you ca nâ€™t use it normally, then restart the router. In addition, is your router connecting an external network?	 In other words, the Internet account is not set?	 There seems to be no that you can get on the Internet?	 If it is a new router, it is impossible to access the Internet without setting up dial -up connections in the router.	 All right.	 Essence	 Thanks.	 Essence	 I'm trying.	 Essence	 I don't understand, please ask you again.	 Essence	 All right.	 Essence	 Yes, if you do not set it, you can refer to the manual, or you can call customer service.	 Don't worry too much.	 Just get it once.
