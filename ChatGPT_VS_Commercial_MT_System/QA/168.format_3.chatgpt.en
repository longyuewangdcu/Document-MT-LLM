What's wrong with my computer that it can't connect to the router? It doesn't work after reaching the step of automatically obtaining the IP address... It always fails to obtain it automatically... The system is W7. First, try to plug the network cable from the modem into the computer and dial up. After connecting, the computer still cannot access the internet... Have you dialed up on the computer?
