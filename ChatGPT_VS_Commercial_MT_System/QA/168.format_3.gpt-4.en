My computer cannot connect to the router, what's the problem? It doesn't work when it comes to automatically obtaining the IP address. It always fails to obtain automatically. My system is Windows 7. First, plug the modem's ethernet cable into your computer and try dialing up. After connecting, the computer still cannot access the internet. Did you try dialing up on your computer?
