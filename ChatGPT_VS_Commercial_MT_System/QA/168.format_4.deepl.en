What's wrong with my computer not being able to connect to the router? It doesn't work when I get to the step of getting an IP address automatically. I can't get it automatically. The system is W7. Try plugging the cable from the cat into the computer to dial up. The computer won't be able to access the Internet even after it's connected. You have dial-up on the computer or not?
