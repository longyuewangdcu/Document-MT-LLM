What's wrong with my computer that it can't connect to the router? It doesn't work at the step of automatically obtaining the IP address. It always fails to obtain it automatically. The system is W7. I'll try changing the password or maybe reconnecting the router's cable. Could it be that the router is broken? It doesn't work even when I bring it to a friend's place. Please check the instructions on the router first, and see if the cables are plugged in correctly. Okay, I'll take a look and try. If it still doesn't work, I'll ask for your help again. Thank you. You're welcome, it's my pleasure to help.
