My computer cannot connect to the router, what's the problem? It doesn't work when it comes to automatically obtaining the IP address. It always fails to obtain automatically. My system is Windows 7. Try changing the password or re-plugging the cables on the router. Could it be that the router is broken? I took it to my friend's house and it still didn't work. First, take a look at the instruction manual for the router and see if the cables are plugged in correctly. Alright, I'll take a look and try again. If it still doesn't work, I'll ask you for help. Thank you. You're welcome, it's my pleasure to help.
