What's wrong with my computer not being able to connect to the router? It doesn't work when I get to the step of getting an IP address automatically. It always fails to get an IP address automatically. The system is W7. Try changing the password or plugging the router cable in again. The company's main business is to provide a wide range of products and services. You should first look at the instructions on the router and see if the wires are plugged in correctly. I'll try it again. I'll ask you again if it doesn't work. Thank you. You're welcome.
