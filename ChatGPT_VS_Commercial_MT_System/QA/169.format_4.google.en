What's wrong with my computer?	 It is not possible to automatically obtain the IP address.	 Essence	 Can't always get it automatically.	 Essence	 Is the system re -modified the password and try it? Will it be the router bad if it is re -inserted on the line on the router?	 You can't use it when you get a friend's house.	 Essence	 Look at the instructions on the router first, look at the line plug, right?	 Essence	 I'm looking at it.	 If you don't work, please ask you again.	 Essence	 Thanks.	 Essence	 You're welcome
