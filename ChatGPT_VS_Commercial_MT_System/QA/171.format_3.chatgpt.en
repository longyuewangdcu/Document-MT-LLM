Why is the WiFi connected but not working? Other people can use it, and there's no limit on the number of users. Try turning off your device and turning it back on again. I've tried that, but I still can't figure it out. Well, then just wait for a bit. There are too many people, so it's a matter of who gets a better connection. It's the same for everyone. If you're still having trouble, you should ask the mobile company. Oh, I see.
