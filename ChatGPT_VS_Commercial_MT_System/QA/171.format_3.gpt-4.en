Why can't I use the WiFi even though I'm connected, while others can use it, and there's no limit on the number of users? Try turning off your device and see. I've tried that, I just don't understand. In that case, just wait a bit. If there are too many people, some might get disconnected due to network prioritization. Same issue. You should ask the mobile service provider then. Oh, okay.
