Just opened an online store for a month, are there any transaction records? Usually, when people open an online store, they ask acquaintances to buy things and leave positive reviews or sell virtual products like Q coins to accumulate popularity. Do you have an answer? My point is, as long as the person is not foolish, there will definitely be transaction records.
