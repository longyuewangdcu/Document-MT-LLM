The newly bought hard drive is a Seagate hard drive that spins at 37200 rpm with a SATA interface. How should it be connected? "6G/S" indicates SATA3 interface, "3G/S" indicates SATA2 interface. To use the IDE interface (which is no longer available on most new motherboards) and RAID (matrix), just leave it at the default settings. The motherboard comes with two black 6G/s data cables, one L-shaped and one straight, and the hard drive also comes with a red cable. Which cable should be used?
