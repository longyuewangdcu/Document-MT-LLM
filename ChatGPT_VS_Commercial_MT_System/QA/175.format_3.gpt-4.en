I bought a new hard drive, it's a Seagate hard drive with SATA 37200 RPM, how do I connect it? 6G/S represents SATA3 interface, 3G/S represents SATA2 interface, and IDE interface (which is not available on most new motherboards) and RAID (matrix). So it means the default setting, right? The motherboard comes with two black 6G/s data cables, one L-shaped and one straight. The hard drive also comes with a red one, which one should I use?
