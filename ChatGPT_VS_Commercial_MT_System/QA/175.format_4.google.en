The newly bought hard disk is the Seagate hard disk of SATA 37200 rpm, how to pick it up.	 6G/s means the SATA3 interface 3G/s means setting the IDE interface for the SATA2 interface (there are no new interfaces on the interface) and RAID (matrix).	 One L -shaped and one is directly inserted, and a red is also given in the hard disk. Which one is used?
