How to perform a low-level format on a hard drive in DOS? Many motherboards now have built-in low-level formatting programs. Use the DOS 6 boot system to run DM to perform a low-level format on the hard drive. Start the computer with a CD and select the DOS toolbox from the CD menu to use DM to low-level format the hard drive. A friendly reminder: if you want to completely remove viruses, you only need to delete all partitions and re-partition the drive. Thank you for reminding me that my hard drive has bad sectors. I heard that low-level formatting can hide bad sectors, but I don't know how to do it. Low-level formatting can only solve logical bad sectors and cannot solve physical bad sectors. In fact, for logical bad sectors, as long as you delete all partitions and re-partition the drive, it can also be solved (if there are not many bad sectors). I made a mistake earlier. Nowadays, there are few motherboards with low-level formatting programs, but the DOS toolbox is included in the current GHOST CD.
