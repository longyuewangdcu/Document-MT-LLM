How do I perform a low-level format on a hard drive in DOS? You can find a low-level formatting program on the motherboard; many motherboards have this feature. You can use DOS6 boot system to run DM for low-level formatting on the hard drive. Alternatively, you can boot the computer with a CD and choose the DOS toolbox from the CD menu to perform low-level formatting using DM directly. Friendly reminder: if you need to perform a low-level format on a hard drive to thoroughly remove viruses, you only need to delete all partitions and create new partitions. Thank you for the reminder. My hard drive has bad sectors, and I heard that low-level formatting can shield bad sectors. I have no choice but to do this! However, I don't know how to perform low-level formatting. Low-level formatting can only solve logical bad sectors, not physical bad sectors. In fact, logical bad sectors can be solved by deleting all partitions and creating new partitions (if there are not many bad sectors). I made a mistake; nowadays, motherboards rarely have low-level formatting programs, but the GHOST version of CDs usually has a DOS toolbox.
