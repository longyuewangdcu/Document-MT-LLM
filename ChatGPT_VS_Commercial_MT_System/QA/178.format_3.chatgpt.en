Why does upgrading the system require a wireless network? How can I set up a cellular system on my iPhone with only 200MB? It's okay to use cellular data without Wi-Fi, but I cannot download anything without Wi-Fi. I think I will update it using my computer instead. I have one monitor and two computers, how can I control both of them with just one monitor? It's for home use and I have internet, what should I do? You can buy a video splitter that can connect to many computers. Haha. How can I do it remotely with remote desktop?
