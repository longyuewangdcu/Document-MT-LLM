Why does upgrading the system require a Wi-Fi connection? How can I set it up to use cellular data? My iPhone with over 200 MB of data allows me to use cellular data. It doesn't matter that I don't have Wi-Fi. I can't set up cellular data download; it requires Wi-Fi. Maybe I should update using a computer instead. How can I control two computers with one monitor in a home setting with internet access? You could buy a video splitter, which allows you to connect multiple computers. Hehe. How do I do it through remote desktop?
