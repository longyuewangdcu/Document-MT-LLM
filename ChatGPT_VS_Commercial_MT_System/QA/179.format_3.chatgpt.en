Are there any families with twins? My two twin daughters are just over two weeks old. They often fight over things and the clothes and toys I buy for them are all the same. Now that the children are still young, I want to encourage my two daughters to be more united. When they grow up, they'll end up like enemies. In fact, there is a solution to this. At night, I call out the youngest one and tell her to listen to her older sister. I tell the older sister to protect her and take care of her younger sister. They should listen to each other. Children are easy to deal with, but as a mother, I need to be patient and keep trying. This method hasn't been effective for me, though. I repeat it every day and they agree, but when it comes to fighting, they forget all about it.
