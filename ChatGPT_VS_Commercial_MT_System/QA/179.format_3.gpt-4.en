Are there any families with twins? My twin daughters are over two weeks old, and they often fight over things. I buy them clothes, toys, and everything else. I hope the sisters can be united as they grow up, but they sometimes act like enemies. Actually, there are solutions. At night, I take the younger one aside and tell her to listen to her older sister, who will protect her. I also tell the older one that as the oldest in the family, she needs to take care of her younger sister. Whoever listens will be considered the younger sister. It's easy to deal with young children. As a mother, you need to be patient and keep going. It's okay, this method doesn't work. I repeat it every day, and they nod and agree at the time, but when they fight, they completely ignore it.
