My twin daughters are over two weeks old and often fight over things. I buy them clothes.Toys, everything is the same. Now that the child is still young, let the two sisters unite and grow up. Make them look like enemies. In fact, the solution is also to take them out at night and say that they should listen to their sister. Sister protects them. Tell the eldest brother that the eldest brother at home should take care of his sister more. It's easy to be a sister. It's okay to be a mother. It's useless. I repeat this method of yours every day. At that time, I nodded and said yes. When I hit, I didn't take it seriously.
