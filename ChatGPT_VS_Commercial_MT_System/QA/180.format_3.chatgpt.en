Are there any families with twins? My two twin daughters are just over two weeks old, and they often fight over things. The clothes and toys that I buy for them are actually the same, but let me tell you a method: for example, when you buy a toy for your child, don't give it to them directly. Instead, let each of them complete a task that is not too easy for them, but not too difficult either. The child who finishes first can choose the toy, but they must help their sister complete her task before they can get the toy. Sigh! Being a parent is not easy.
