Are there families with twins? My twin daughters are over two weeks old, and they often fight over things. I buy them clothes, toys, and everything else, which are actually the same. But let me tell you a method: when you buy toys for the children, don't give them directly. Instead, let each of them complete a task that is not too easy but not too difficult for them. The child who finishes first can choose a toy first, but she must help her sister complete her task before she can get the toy. Ah! Being a parent is so difficult.
