Do you have a family with twins? My two twin daughters are more than two weeks old and often fight over things, I bought them clothes, toys, and everything. The child who finishes first gets to pick the toy first, but only after she helps her sister or sisters finish her task. Ouch! It's so hard to be a parent.
