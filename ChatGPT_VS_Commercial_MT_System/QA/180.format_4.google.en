Is there a twin family?	 My two twin daughters have been fighting for more than two weeks. I often fight for things to fight. The clothes I bought for them are actually the same, but tell you a method, for example	 They, first let them complete one of them that are not easy to complete but not too difficult for them. The children who are completed first can pick toys first, but they must only help her sister or sister to complete her.	 Get toy.	 Why!	 This parent is too bad.
