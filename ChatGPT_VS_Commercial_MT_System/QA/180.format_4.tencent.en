Do you have a family with twins? My two twin daughters have been here for more than two weeks and often fight over things. The clothes and toys I bought for them are actually the same, but I'll tell you a way, for example, don't give them toys directly when you buy them. Let them do something that is not easy for them to do but not too difficult for them.The child who finishes first can pick the toy first, but he can only get the toy after helping his sister or sister finish her work.
