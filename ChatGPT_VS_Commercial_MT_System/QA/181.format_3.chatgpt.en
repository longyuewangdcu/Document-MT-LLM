Are there any families with twins? My two twin daughters are just over two weeks old and often fight over things. The clothes and toys I buy for them are all for these two kids. Their personalities don't complement each other. Yes, they are both very stubborn. Should I take them to early education classes? This is a critical period for personality formation, so I need to teach them well. My daughter just turned one year old, and her temper is also bad. Why are kids so difficult to manage nowadays?
