Do families have twins? My twin daughters are over two weeks old, and they often fight over things. The clothes and toys I buy for them are for both of them. Their personalities don't complement each other. Yes, they are both very stubborn. Have you tried taking them to early education classes? This is the time when their personalities are forming, so it's important to teach them well. My daughter just turned one, and she has a bad temper too. Why are children so hard to raise nowadays?
