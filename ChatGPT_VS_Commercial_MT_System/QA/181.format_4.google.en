Is there a twin family?	 My two twin daughters have been fighting for more than two weeks. I often fight for the fight. The clothes I bought for them, toys, and everything I bought is not complementary.	 Woolen cloth?	 At this time, it is a period of personality formation. It is necessary to teach well. My daughter is just one year old and has a bad temper.	 Why is it so difficult to bring now?
