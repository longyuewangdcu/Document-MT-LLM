Do you have a family with twins? My two twin daughters are more than two weeks old. They often fight over things. The clothes and toys I bought for them are not complementary to each other. Yes, they are very stubborn. Should I take them to an early education class? This is the period of character formation. I should teach them well. My daughter is just one year old and has a bad temper. Why is it so difficult to take care of children now
