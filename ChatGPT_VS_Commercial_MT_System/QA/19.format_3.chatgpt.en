May I ask all the professionals, what material is used to make the entire TV background below? Leather soft package with tea mirror??? Can you please provide a detailed introduction? What materials are used for the middle part, brown part, and floral part on both sides? Urgent! The floral part on the edge is a PVC wall sticker, which is available for purchase online!
