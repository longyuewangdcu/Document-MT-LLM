I lost my ID card, how can I get a boarding pass? Can you please provide a detailed explanation? Thank you. Do you have your driver's license, passport, or household registration? As long as it matches your ID card. Can I get a boarding pass with my driver's license? It seems like I can't. You should be able to. You can use it to take high-speed rail and regular trains. I haven't tried it for a flight, but you can ask the staff at the station. They should have a public security window where you can apply for a temporary ID card.
