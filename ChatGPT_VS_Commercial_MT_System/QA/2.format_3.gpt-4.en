My ID card is lost, can you please tell me how to replace my boarding pass? It would be great if you could provide a detailed explanation. Thank you. Do you have a driver's license, passport, household registration book or anything like that? As long as it can match your ID card information. Can I use my driver's license to replace my boarding pass? It seems like I might not be able to. You should be able to, it works for high-speed trains and bullet trains. I haven't tried it for flights, though. You can ask the staff at the station, there should be a public security window for temporary ID cards. Just go and ask them.
