I've lost my ID card, so how do I change my boarding pass? The actual fact is that you will be able to get the right ID card. I have a driver's license to change boarding passes ~ seems to change Oh should be able to take high-speed trains, moving trains are able to take the plane did not try, you find the station staff, there should be the kind of public security window, do temporary ID cards, you go ask.
