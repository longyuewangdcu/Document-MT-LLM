The ID card is dropped. How can I change the card to the board?	 As long as it is the upper number that can be paired with your ID card.	 Do I have a driver's license? Can I change my license plate ~ I seem to be able to change it. It should be possible. I can take the high -speed rail and the vehicle. I haven't tried it by the plane. You should find the staff in the station.	 If you prove, you go to ask.
