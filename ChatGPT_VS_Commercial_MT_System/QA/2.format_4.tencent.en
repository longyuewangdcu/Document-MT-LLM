I lost my ID card. I would like to ask you how to change your boarding pass. Please give me a detailed thank you. Do you have a driver's license, passport, household registration book or something? As long as it can match your ID card, I can change my boarding pass if I have a driver's license. It seems that I can't change it. I should be able to take the high-speed rail or the bullet train. I haven't tried taking the plane. You can find the staff at the station. There should be that kind of public security window. If you apply for a temporary ID card, you can ask.
