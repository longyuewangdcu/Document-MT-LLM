My company requires employees to purchase a car in order to continue working. After buying a car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan for car expenses. If you do not buy a car, you will automatically resign. May I ask if there are any car brands that qualify? Can I get the same subsidy if I buy a bicycle? Please don't look down on people.
