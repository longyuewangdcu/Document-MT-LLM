The company I work for requires employees to purchase a car in order to continue working. After buying a car, the company provides a subsidy of 88 yuan for the car. If you don't buy a car, you will be automatically dismissed. May I ask if there are any brands of cars where buying a bicycle also gets a subsidy of 88 yuan? Don't look down on people.
