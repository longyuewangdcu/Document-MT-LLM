My company requires employees to buy a car in order to continue working. After purchasing the car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan for the car expenses. If you do not buy a car, you will automatically resign. May I ask what brand of car you want to buy? A used QQ car is the cheapest, but it is too expensive. Moreover, the company requires us to buy a new car. What price range are you looking for? A little over 10,000 yuan plus the cost of registration is less than 20,000 yuan. I think buying an electric car for a little over 10,000 yuan without registration is a good option.
