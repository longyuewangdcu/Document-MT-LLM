My company requires employees to purchase a car in order to continue working. After buying a car, the company provides a subsidy of 88 yuan for the car. If you don't buy a car, you will automatically leave the company. What brand of car should I buy? The cheapest option is a second-hand QQ, but it's too expensive, and the company requires a new car. What price range are you looking for? Around 10,000 yuan, and with the license plate, it would be less than 20,000 yuan. How about buying an electric car? One that costs over 10,000 yuan and doesn't include the license plate.
