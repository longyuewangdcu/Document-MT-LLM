My company requires employees to buy a car to continue working. After purchasing a car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan. If you do not buy a car, you will automatically be dismissed. May I ask if there are any car brands that are not as expensive as the BYD F0 or Alto? What kind of company is this? It's too unreasonable. Can't we buy a van or even an elderly mobility scooter that runs on gasoline and doesn't require a license plate? An elderly mobility scooter? Well, there should be places that sell motorcycles. A few thousand yuan, not exceeding ten thousand.
