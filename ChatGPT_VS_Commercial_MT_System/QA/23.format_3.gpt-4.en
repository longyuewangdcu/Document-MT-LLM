The company I work for requires employees to purchase a car to continue working. After buying a car, the company provides a subsidy of 88 yuan. If you don't buy a car, you will automatically resign. I wonder what brands of cars are there? BYD F0 and Suzuki Alto are too expensive. What kind of company is this? It's so weird. I have no choice. A van would also work. If not, I'll just buy an elderly walking car that runs on gasoline with four wheels and no license plate required. Elderly walking car? Yeah, I think there should be some at places that sell motorcycles. A few thousand yuan, not exceeding ten thousand.
