My company requires employees to buy a car before they can continue working. After buying a car, the company subsidizes 88 yuan for the car subsidy. If you don't buy a car, you will automatically leave your job. What brand of car is there? BYD f0 Alto is too expensive. What company is this? It's too strange. There's no way to do it.
