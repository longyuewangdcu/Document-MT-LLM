My company requires employees to buy a car in order to continue working. After purchasing a car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan. If you don't buy a car, you will automatically resign. Can you recommend any car brands or companies? Sorry, I have no choice but to ask for your help in thinking of something.
