My company requires employees to purchase a car in order to continue working. After buying the car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan for the car. If you don't buy a car, you will automatically resign. May I ask if there are any specific brands of cars that are required? Or can a used car like a Shali be purchased, or does it need to be brand new?
