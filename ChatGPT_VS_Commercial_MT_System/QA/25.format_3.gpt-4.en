The company I work for requires employees to buy a car in order to continue working. After purchasing a car, the company provides a subsidy of 88 RMB for the car. If you don't buy a car, you'll automatically be considered as having quit the job. May I ask, are there any brands of third-hand Xiali cars? I want a brand-new one.
