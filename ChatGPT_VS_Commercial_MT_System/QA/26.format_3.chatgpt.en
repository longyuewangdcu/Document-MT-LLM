My company requires employees to buy a car in order to continue working. After buying a car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan for the car. If you do not buy a car, you will automatically resign. May I ask if there are any car brands that are too expensive? My budget is just over 10,000 yuan, including the cost of the license plate. The cheapest option would be preferred. If new cars are too expensive, I can consider buying a used car for under 10,000 yuan.
