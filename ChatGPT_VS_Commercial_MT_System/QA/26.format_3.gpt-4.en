The company I work for requires employees to buy a car in order to continue working. After purchasing a car, the company provides a subsidy of 88 RMB for the car. If you don't buy a car, you'll automatically resign. May I ask, what brand of car is too expensive? I only have a little over 10,000 RMB, and that needs to include the cost of a license plate. I want the cheapest option. Should I buy a used one? It doesn't even have to cost 10,000 RMB, but I want a new car.
