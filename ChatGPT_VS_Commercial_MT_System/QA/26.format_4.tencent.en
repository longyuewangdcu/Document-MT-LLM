My company requires employees to buy a car before they can continue working. After buying a car, the company subsidizes 88 yuan as a car subsidy. If you don't buy a car, you will leave automatically. What brand of car is too expensive? I only have more than 10,000 yuan, including the cheapest one with a license plate. I don't need a new car even if I buy a second-hand car for 10,000 yuan.
