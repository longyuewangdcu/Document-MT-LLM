I am 16 years old now, but I have spots on my face. Is there any way to remove them? Eat more fruits, it's okay during adolescence. Are there any little tips to remove spots? First, don't use spot-removing cosmetics; use traditional Chinese medicine instead of medication. Who can tell me how to make the Didi driver accept orders faster? Add more money. I am a driver.
