I would like to buy a car with a price range below 1 million. Can you guys help me decide what car to buy? Which one is better between Audi A8, Jaguar XJ, and Q7? If I want a more powerful car, I could buy a Toyota Land Cruiser or a Lincoln Navigator that looks like an armored vehicle. How about a Mercedes-Benz G65? Anyway, they are all pretty good. Thank you. What about a Bugatti?
