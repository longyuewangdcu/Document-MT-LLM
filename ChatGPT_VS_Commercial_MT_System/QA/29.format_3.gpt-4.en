I want to buy a car priced below 1 million, what kind of car should I buy? Friends, please help me think. Audi A8 or Jaguar XJ, which one is better with the Q7? If you want something more domineering, consider the Toyota Sequoia or the Lincoln Navigator, which are like driving armored vehicles. How about the Mercedes G65? Anyway, they are all pretty good. Thank you. How about Bugatti?
