I am currently 180 pounds and am trying to lose weight, but I have a sweet tooth and want to eat braised pork and instant noodles. Especially at night, when I wake up, I want to eat meat. If I am not hungry, should I drink water and eat fruit? I only want to eat meat, and if I eat fruit, I feel nauseous. Losing weight is a difficult task, and I must have the determination to succeed! Keep it up! Okay, thank you.
