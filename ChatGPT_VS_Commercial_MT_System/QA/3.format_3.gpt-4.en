I am currently 180 jin (about 90 kg) and trying to lose weight, but I have cravings for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, when I wake up, I just want to eat meat. When I'm not hungry, I drink water and eat fruit, but I only want to eat meat. Eating fruit makes me want to throw up. Losing weight is a long and difficult journey; I must have perseverance to succeed! Keep going! Hmm, thank you.
