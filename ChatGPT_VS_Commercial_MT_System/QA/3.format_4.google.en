I am wearing 180 pounds now, but what should I do if I want to eat braised pork and instant noodles?	 Especially at night, I want to eat meat when I wake up. If I am not hungry, drink water and eat fruit. I just want to eat meat. When I eat fruit, I want to vomit weight loss. I must have perseverance!	 come on!	 um. Thank you
