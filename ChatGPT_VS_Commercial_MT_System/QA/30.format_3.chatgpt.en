I would like to buy a car with a price range of below one million. Can anyone suggest what kind of car is good? How much does the Mercedes ML350 cost, and is it a good choice to drive without spending one million? Is it easy to drive, and how is its performance and configuration? Also, what about the BMW X5? Thank you. Which one is better, the Touareg or the ML350? How can a Volkswagen be compared to a Mercedes? However, many comments say that the Touareg is good. The 350 model sells better and has a higher cost performance, but is the Range Rover also a good choice? The fuel consumption of the Range Rover is similar to that of the Hummer. What do you think? I'm asking you because I don't know. Actually, I think the Land Rover Evoque is pretty good and looks very nice. Is the Range Rover not good?
