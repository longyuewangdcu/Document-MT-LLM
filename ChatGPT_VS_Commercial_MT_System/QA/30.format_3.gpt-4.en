I want to buy a car priced below 1 million, what kind of car should I get? Friends, please help me think about this. How much does the Mercedes-Benz ML350 cost? It shouldn't be more than 1 million on the road. Is it easy to drive, and how's its performance and configuration? Another good choice is the X5. Thank you. Which one is better, the Touareg or the 350? How can Volkswagen compare with Mercedes-Benz? However, many reviews say that the Touareg is very good. The 350 is more popular, and the more people buy it, the higher the cost-performance ratio. Is it better than the Range Rover? The fuel consumption of the Range Rover seems to be similar to that of the Hummer. What do you think? I'm asking you because I don't know. Actually, I think the Range Rover Evoque is pretty good and beautiful. Isn't the Range Rover good?
