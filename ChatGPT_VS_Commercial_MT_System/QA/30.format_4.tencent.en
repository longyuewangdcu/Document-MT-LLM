I want to buy a car at a price of 1 million. What kind of car is good to buy? Dear friends, help me to think about how much is the Mercedes-Benz ml350 on the road, not a million good to open? How is the performance? How is the configuration? How is the good choice? There are x5 thank you Tu Rui and 350. How can that good Volkswagen compare with Mercedes-Benz? Many comments say that Tu Rui is very good 350 is more popular, buy more cost-effective, there is no Range Rover, good fuel consumption, Range Rover feels like Hummer, you think, I don't know, I ask you, actually think Land Rover Aurora is good, very beautiful, Range Rover is not good
