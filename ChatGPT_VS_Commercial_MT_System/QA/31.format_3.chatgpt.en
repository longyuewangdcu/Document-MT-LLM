I want to buy a car that costs less than 1 million yuan. What kind of car should I buy? Can you help me decide, friends? Should I buy a sedan or an SUV? For a car under 1 million yuan, I'm considering a sedan, such as a Jaguar XJL or a Mercedes-Benz S350, or an SUV like the Land Rover Discovery 3.0t. Can you help me find a pair of shoes that are the same as these? Do you know the name of the shoes? If you do, please let me know. I added some additional information: my QQ number is 1298281692. What can I add to make the latex paint stronger in terms of coverage? The best option is to add tinting color, but generally, colored paints have good coverage. The adhesion strength depends on the brand. I want a white paint with good coverage.
