My surname is Shang. I would like to ask all netizens to give a meaningful and easy-to-pronounce name for my daughter. I am in a hurry, thank you. Shang Yiyi! Shang Yao... this name is already taken by someone I know. Uh...do you have any other suggestions? Shang Tong... Shang Qi... Sorry, those are also taken. Naming is really a headache.
