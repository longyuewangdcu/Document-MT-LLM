My surname is Shang. I ask for the help of fellow netizens to give my daughter a catchy, smooth, and meaningful name. Please, I'm in a hurry, thank you. Shang Yiyi! Shang Yao... Someone I know already has this name. Uh... dear, do you have any other ideas? Shang Tong... Shang Qi... Sorry for the duplicate name, naming is really a headache.
