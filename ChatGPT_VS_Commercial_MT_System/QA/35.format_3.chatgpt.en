My surname is "Shang". I would like to ask all netizens to suggest a meaningful and pleasant name for my daughter. I am in a hurry, thank you. The names I have considered are "Shang Lingxi", "Shang Zimei" and "Shang Yeming". Thank you, beautiful lady, but none of them are the name I have chosen. As a high school student, I can't think of any good names, haha. It's okay, but if you come across or hear any nice names recently, please send them to me. Thank you.
