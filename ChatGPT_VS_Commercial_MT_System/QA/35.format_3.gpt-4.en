My surname is Shang, and I'm asking for netizens to help come up with a catchy and meaningful name for my daughter. Please, I'm in a hurry, thank you. Shang Lingxi, Shang Zimei, Shang Yeming. Thank you, beautiful lady, but I'm sorry, none of these really caught my eye. It's alright, I'm just a high school student and can't think of any good-sounding names, hehe. No problem, but if you come across or hear any nice names recently, please send them to me. Thank you.
