Two people fell into a trap and died. What do you call the person who can bring the dead back to life? This is a brain teaser. Of course, the answer is "help". Now, if two people fell into a trap and one died while the other survived, what do you call the survivor? The answer is not "rescuer" or "living person". I'm not sure what the answer is.
