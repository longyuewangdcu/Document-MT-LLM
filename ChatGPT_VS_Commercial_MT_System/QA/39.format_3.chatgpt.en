I posted a message saying that my waist was uncomfortable, and that girl left a lot of negative comments. Damn it, I'm innocent. I'm planning to pursue her. Is there any hope? What does she mean? Haha, there is hope! She even commented actively! As a girl, her mentality is usually to test you and see how you respond. If you admit it, she will definitely be disappointed! Really? Absolutely and definitely! If she doesn't have feelings for you, why would she leave a comment? It's just to find a topic to talk about. Before falling in love, teasing and ambiguity is common.
