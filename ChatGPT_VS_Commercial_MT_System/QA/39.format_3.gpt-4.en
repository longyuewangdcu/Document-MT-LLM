I posted a message saying my waist is uncomfortable, and that girl commented that I must have done too many bad things. Damn, I've been wronged. I'm planning to pursue her. Is there any hope? What does she mean? Haha, there is hope! She even took the initiative to comment! Speaking from a girl's perspective, this is usually a test to see how you respond. If you admit it, she will definitely be disappointed! Really? Absolutely! If she had no feelings for you, why would she bother to comment? It's just to find a topic to talk about. Before falling in love, it's all about teasing and flirting with each other.
