I sent a comment, my waist is uncomfortable, that woman's comment has done too many bad things, damn it, I'm wronged, I'm going to pursue her, is there hope? What does she mean? Haha, there is hope! She even took the initiative to comment! My mentality as a girl! Generally, this is to test you, to see how you answer, if you admit, she will definitely be disappointed! Really? Definitely and definitely! If you don't have feelings for you, why take the initiative to comment! Isn't it just to find a topic? Before dating, we all tease and flirt with each other
