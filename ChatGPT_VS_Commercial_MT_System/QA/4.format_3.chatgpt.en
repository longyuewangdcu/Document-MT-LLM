I am currently 180 jin and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. Especially at night, I wake up wanting to eat meat. I think I cannot just rely on dieting to lose weight. The key is to exercise more and have a reasonable diet. Walking is already tiring for me, not to mention exercising, which could be fatal. Thank you anyway.
