I am now 180 jin (90 kg) and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles, what should I do? Especially at night, when I wake up, I just want to eat meat. I guess I can't just rely on dieting to lose weight, but need to exercise more and have a balanced diet. Even walking is tiring, let alone exercising, which may take my life. But thank you anyway.
