I am now 180 pounds is losing weight, but I have a craving to eat red meat and noodles how to do? Especially at night, woke up wanting to eat meat, I did not lose weight can not be a diet, the main thing is to exercise more, a reasonable diet. Walking is very tired let alone exercise, it will kill me, but thank you!
