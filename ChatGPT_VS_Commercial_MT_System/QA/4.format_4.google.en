I am wearing 180 pounds now, but what should I do if I want to eat braised pork and instant noodles?	 Especially in the evening, I want to eat meat when I wake up. Do I have no weight loss and I ca n’t diet, mainly to exercise more and eat reasonably.	 I am tired of walking, so don’t mention my exercise, I will want me to die, but thank you
