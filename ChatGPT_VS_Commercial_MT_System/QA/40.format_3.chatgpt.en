I posted a status update saying that my back was hurting, and that woman left a lot of negative comments. Damn, I'm innocent here. I'm planning to pursue her, is there any hope? What does she mean? She was just joking with you. At least this shows that you are closer and easier to get along with in her eyes. Go for it, there is a chance of success~ I have already made an appointment with her. How should I pursue her?
