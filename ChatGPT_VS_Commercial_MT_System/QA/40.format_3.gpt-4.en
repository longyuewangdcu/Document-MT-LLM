English translation: I posted a status about my back being uncomfortable, and that girl commented that I must have done too many bad things. Damn, I'm wronged! I'm planning to pursue her, is there any hope? What does she mean? She's just joking with you, which at least shows that in her eyes, you are relatively close and easy to get along with... Go ahead, there's a chance of success! I've already asked her out, how should I pursue her?
