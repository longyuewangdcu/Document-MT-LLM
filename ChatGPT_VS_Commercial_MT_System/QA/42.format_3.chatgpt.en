I posted a message saying my waist is uncomfortable, and that woman left many negative comments. Damn it, I'm innocent! I'm planning to pursue her, is there any hope? What does she mean? Definitely have a chance, keep going and I wish you happiness! We've known each other for two months, how should I pursue her? Have you confessed your feelings to her? No, I haven't. She asked me to help her take care of her dog some time ago. Is she single? Yes, she is. She broke up with her ex a month ago. Invite her out and confess your feelings in person, not over the phone or through messages. Is the success rate high? If you're worried about not being able to catch up, it's not good for your friendship either. Yes, face is also important. I don't like to be too pushy, at most two attempts, then I'll disappear. If you like her, be bold and speak up. It's better to regret what you have done than what you haven't. There are several guys pursuing her, and she says she values her feelings a lot. She told me she likes bad boys, but not too much. "Bad" can have many meanings. What does she mean? Actually, it's the kind of daring and fearless person who can protect her and make her feel safe. She just broke up, so don't rush to pursue her. You can tell her that you like her and have been paying attention to her for a long time, but you heard that she just broke up, so it's not appropriate to confess now. However, you always think of her and would like her to consider it seriously. It mainly depends on how she is recovering now. Recovering? She is still in the grieving stage. It depends on the person. Some people really need comfort and care in this situation. What about the tomboy type of girl? Her boyfriend is in jail.
