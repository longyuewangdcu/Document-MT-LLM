I posted a message saying my waist was uncomfortable, and the girl commented that I must have done many bad things. Damn it, I'm wronged! I'm planning to pursue her, is there any hope? What does she mean? There is definitely hope, go for it and chase her, wish you happiness! We've known each other for two months, how should I pursue her? Have you confessed your feelings? No. She asked me to help her take care of her dog some time ago. Is she single? Yes, she broke up a month ago. Ask her out and confess your feelings to her, don't do it over the phone or through messages. Is the success rate high? Are you worried that if you can't catch up, it'll be hard to remain friends? Yeah, saving face is important too. I don't like to pester people relentlessly; at most, I'll try twice and then disappear. Since you like her, just boldly confess your feelings. It's better to regret something you've done than something you haven't. There are several guys pursuing her. She told me that she values feelings a lot, and she said she likes bad boys, but not excessively. "Bad" can have many meanings. What does she mean? Actually, she means someone who's bold and fearless, able to protect her and give her a sense of security. She just broke up, so you shouldn't rush to pursue her, right? You can tell her that you like her and have noticed her for a long time, but you heard she just broke up recently, so it's not suitable to confess your feelings now. However, you can't stop thinking about her, so you wanted to let her know and give her some time to consider it. Be very sincere and genuine when you say this. It mainly depends on how well she has recovered. Recovered? She's still in the sad stage. It depends on the person; some people in this situation really need the comfort and care from others. She's the tomboyish type. Her boyfriend went to jail.
