I posted a message saying that my waist is uncomfortable. That girl left a lot of negative comments. Damn, I'm being wronged. I'm thinking of pursuing her. Is there any hope? What does she mean? She was saying that you have a lot of sexual activity in bed, don't you understand? I haven't done anything. What can I do if she thinks that way?
