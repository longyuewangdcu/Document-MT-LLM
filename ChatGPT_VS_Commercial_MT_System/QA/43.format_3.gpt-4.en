I posted a message saying that my waist was uncomfortable. That woman commented that I must have done many bad things. Damn, I feel wronged! I plan to pursue her, is there any hope? What does she mean? Someone said it's because you've done a lot of things in bed, don't you understand? I haven't done it! If someone thinks like that, what can I do?
