I sent a comment saying that my waist is uncomfortable. The woman commented that she has done too many bad things. Damn it, I am wronged. I am going to pursue her. Is there any hope? What does she mean? She means that you have done too many things in bed. Don't you understand? I didn't do it. What can I do if she thinks so
