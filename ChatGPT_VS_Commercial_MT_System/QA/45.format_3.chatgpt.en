What is website hosting for computer experts? Does every website have hosting? How do I upload files using FTP? Can you explain in detail? Every website has its own hosting space. If it's an enterprise website, after purchasing hosting space, the service provider will give you a management account, an address, and login credentials. Once you log in, you can see details about the hosting space. You can call your hosting provider to get management permissions and access to the space. Oh, your website was created on the website builder platform called ""Fanka"" and it's free. Some websites have hosting included.
