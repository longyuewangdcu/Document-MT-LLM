How to do it specifically? Is there a conflict between the external interrupt and the timer of the microcontroller? Can you help me take a look at the program? There is a chance that the external interrupt will cause the timer to stop working or no longer interrupt. Firstly, your Timer 1 is in mode 0 (13-bit counter), and unless you use a very low frequency external crystal, the timing time of Timer 1 is not at the second level at all. Secondly, you have not posted the location where the time run flag is modified. If you suspect that Timer 1 is not working continuously, you can temporarily remove the if (time run == 1) condition and observe whether the digital tube displays the changing value every time. By the way, the statement in your Timer0 interrupt is inefficient, and this is not a healthy interrupt service function. The interrupt service function should strive to be concise and clear. Secondly, I once tried to remove time run, but the problem that occurred was the same. Thirdly, I tried to move the contents of Timer0 to another function, and then added a=1 in Timer0. In the main function, I added if (a==1) {run the function mentioned earlier here}. The first line of the function wrote a=0, trying to slim down the interrupt service program, but the program didn't work. As for the infrared remote control part, because of time constraints, I excerpted information, so I am not very familiar with it.
