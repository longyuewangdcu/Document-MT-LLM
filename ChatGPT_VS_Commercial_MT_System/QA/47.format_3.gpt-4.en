How exactly do we do this? Is there a conflict between the microcontroller's external interrupt and the timer? Please help me take a look at the program~ The external interrupt has a chance to make the timer stop working or no longer interrupt. First of all, your Timer 1 is in mode 0 (13-bit counter), and unless you use a very low-frequency external crystal, the timing of Timer 1 is not at the second level. Secondly, you didn't post the location where the time run flag is modified. If you suspect that Timer 1 is not continuously working, you can temporarily remove the if (time run == 1) condition and observe whether the digital tube displays changing values each time. By the way, the statements in your Timer 0 interrupt are inefficient, which is not a healthy interrupt service function. Interrupt service functions should be concise and fast.	Regarding the second point, I have tried removing the time run, but the problem remains the same. For the third point, I have tried moving the contents of timer 0 to another function, and then adding an a=1 in timer 0. In the main function, I added if (a==1) {run the function just mentioned here}, and the first line of the function wrote a=0, trying to "slim down" the interrupt service program, but the program didn't work. As for the infrared remote control part, I didn't have a deep understanding of it since I took the information due to time constraints.
