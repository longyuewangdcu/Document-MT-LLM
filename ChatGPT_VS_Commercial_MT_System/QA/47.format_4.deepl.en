How to do it exactly . The microcontroller external interrupt and timer conflict? Help to see the program ~ external interrupt has a chance to make the timer stop working or no longer interrupt First of all, your Timer 1 is mode 0 (13-bit counter), unless you use a very low frequency external crystal, the timing time of Timer 1 is not at all seconds. Secondly you didn't post where the time run flag was modified. If you suspect that Timer1 is not working continuously, you can temporarily remove the if( time run == 1 ) condition and observe if the digital tube displays a changing value every time. By the way the statements inside your Timer0 interrupt are inefficient, this is not a healthy interrupt service function. The interrupt service function is meant to be clean and concise. Second point, I have tried to remove time run, but the problem is the same. The third point, I have tried to move the contents of timer0 to another function, and then add an a=1 in timer0, the main function plus if(a==1) {here to run the function just described}, the first line of the function wrote a=0, trying to give the interrupt service program to lose weight, but the program can not move. Infrared remote control part, because of the time to pick the information, so it is not very good.
