What do you do? The external interruption of the single -chip microcomputer is conflict with the timer?	 Help look at the program ~ There is a chance to stop working at the external interruption or stop working or no longer interrupt.	 Sound.	 Secondly, you did not post the location where the time run logo was modified.	 If you suspect that Timer1 does not continue to work, you can temporarily remove the if (time run == 1) conditions to observe whether the digital tube shows the value of the change every time.	 By the way, the statement in your Timer0 interrupt is low, which is not a healthy interrupt service function.	 The interrupt service function must strive for simplicity and brightness.	 Secondly, I tried to remove Time Run, but the problems that would occur were the same.	 The third point, I tried to move the content of Timer0 to another function, and then add a A = 1 to Timer0, add IF (a == 1) to the main function	 The first line of the line was written a = 0, trying to lose weight to the interrupt service program, but the program could not move.	 The infrared remote control part is not very good because of the data of time relationship.
