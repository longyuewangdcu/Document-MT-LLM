SCM external interrupt and timer conflict? Help to see the program ~ external interrupt has a chance to make the timer stop working or no longer interrupt first of all your Timer 1 is mode 0(13-bit counter), Unless you use a very low frequency external crystal, Otherwise Timer 1 timing time is not seconds. Secondly, You did not post the time run flag was modified position. If you suspect that Timer1 does not work continuously, You can temporarily remove if.( time run == 1 ) condition to see if the nixie tube shows a changing value each time. By the way, your Timer0 interrupt statement is inefficient, this is not a healthy interrupt service function. The interrupt service function is to be concise. Second, I have tried to remove time run, but the problem is the same. Third, I have tried to move the contents of timer0 to another function.Then in timer0 plus a=1, the main function plus if(a==1){here to run the function just mentioned}, the first line of the function wrote a=0, trying to interrupt the service program to lose weight, but the program can not move.
