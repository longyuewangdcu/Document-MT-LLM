Computer Configuration: There is absolutely no problem playing GTA4 with this configuration. If you experience low FPS, then there might be some issues with the hardware or drivers. The E5500 CPU is a dual-core processor with 2 threads, and 4GB of RAM with a GTS450 graphics card. There should be no problem playing large-scale games with this setup. The game itself doesn't eat up too much CPU, but instead relies heavily on the graphics card, memory, and hard drive. Based on some reviews, GTA4 primarily relies on CPU and memory. As for the GTS450 graphics card, I suggest buying a Galax one. From what I know, this graphics card was produced around 2011 and has been discontinued. Most of the cards available in the market are refurbished. Given this, will GTA4 run smoothly on medium to high settings with this setup? Or will it run perfectly?
