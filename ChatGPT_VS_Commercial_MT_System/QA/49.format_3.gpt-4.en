Computer configuration: The configuration can definitely handle playing GTA4 without any issues. If the FPS is low, there must be a problem with the hardware. Drivers are also crucial. E5500 CPU, dual-core, 2 threads + 4GB RAM + GTS450 can definitely handle large-scale games. Games don't consume CPU as much as you'd think; they rely more on the graphics card, memory, and hard drive. Based on some reviews, GTA4 mainly consumes CPU and memory resources. I am considering buying the GTS450 graphics card from Galaxy. As far as I know, this graphics card was produced around 2011 and has now been discontinued, so most available ones are refurbished. In this case, can GTA4 run smoothly or even perfectly with medium to high graphics settings?
