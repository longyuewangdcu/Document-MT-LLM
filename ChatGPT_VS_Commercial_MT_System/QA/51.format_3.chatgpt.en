Can an expert take a look at this configuration and tell me if it can handle large games (smoothly with special effects turned off) and mold design? How much do I need to spend on a graphics card? Is a graphics card that costs around 700 yuan good enough? Can I get a good one for around 3000 yuan? My friend used the same configuration and it works well for him.
