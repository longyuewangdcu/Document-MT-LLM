Expert, please help me take a look. Can this configuration run large games (no special effects, just smooth performance) and support mold design? How much would it cost to add a graphics card? No problem, a 700-yuan graphics card should be enough, right? Can I get it for around 3,000 yuan? It's my friend's configuration, and he's also using this one.
