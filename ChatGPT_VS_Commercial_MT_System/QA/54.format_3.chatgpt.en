How to root a Samsung GT-I9128E? I've tried various one-click cracking methods but none of them worked!! It should be because there is not enough memory. You can try using Baidu's one-click root, but if that doesn't work, it means your memory is insufficient. If you have already tried the first option with Baidu and your 8GB SD card is still not enough, then it may be a problem with your phone. There are many phones that cannot be rooted because the corresponding cracking program has not been developed. My question is, which root software has been developed to crack the 9128e? If you don't know, please don't speak.
