How do I root the Samsung GT-I9128E? I've tried all sorts of one-click unlocking methods and none of them work! It's probably due to insufficient memory; try using Baidu's one-click root. That doesn't work either! The first one I tried was Baidu's. Then it must be because your memory is not enough, try changing the SD card. Is 8GB not enough? Then it must be an issue with your phone. Many phones don't work because there isn't a corresponding unlocking program developed yet. What I want to ask is which root software has developed a solution for the 9128E? If you don't know, don't say anything.
