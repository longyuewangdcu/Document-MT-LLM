My eyeballs have always been resting on the upper eyelids. Is this called "xia san bai yan" (a type of eye shape in Chinese)? Are there any disadvantages? Your eyes are so beautiful, but I have been concerned about my nearsightedness for a long time. However, some people who are nearsighted don't have eyeballs like mine. Are your parents the same? My parents aren't like this, but they both have double eyelids. Only my eyeball is positioned upward.
