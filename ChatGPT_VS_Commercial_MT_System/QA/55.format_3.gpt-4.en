My eyeball has always been leaning against the upper eyelid, is this considered having "sanbaiyan" (a Chinese term referring to the white part of the eye being visible below the iris), and are there any disadvantages? Such beautiful eyes are myopic, I have also been paying attention to this issue for a long time, and I am nearsighted too. But some people with nearsightedness don't have eyeballs like this, are your parents like this? My parents aren't like that, but they both have double eyelids. Only my eyeball leans upwards.
