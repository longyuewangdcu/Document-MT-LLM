My eyes have always been against the upper eyelid, is this the lower three white eyes, what is the harm. So beautiful eyes nearsighted I am also concerned about the problem for a long time I also I am nearsighted but some people are nearsighted eyes are not like this, your parents are not like this My parents are not ah, but both are double eyelids. I am the only one whose eyes are leaning upwards.
