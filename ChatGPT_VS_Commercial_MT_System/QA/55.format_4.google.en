My eyes have always leaned on the eyelids. Is this the lower three white eyes? What are the disadvantages?	 So beautiful eyes, I have also paid attention to the problem for a long time. I have been myopia for a long time, but some people are not myopia. Is this like this? My parents are not, but they are both double eyelids.	 Only my eyes are leaning up.
