Are my purchases from Le Gou website fake? Does anyone know the phone number? Online shopping has a 7-day no-reason return policy. Is 12315 the same as all complaint hotlines? I need Le Gou's phone number, yes, it's the 12315 consumer complaint hotline. You can return the goods. They don't answer the phone and don't reply to my messages. They disappeared completely. Then you should file a complaint against them.
