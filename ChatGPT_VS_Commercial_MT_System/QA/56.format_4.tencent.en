Is the product I bought from Tesco a fake product? Does anyone know the phone number? Is the complaint number 12315 the same for all the complaint calls? I want the phone number from Tesco. Yes, 12315 for the consumer to complain and report. You can return the product. I called him but he didn't answer the phone. I sent him a message but he didn't reply to me. Then I complained about him.
