After installing Youku, why can't it play? Is it because the phone only supports hardware decoding and the fake phone CPU can't support it? It used to work before, but now it's not. The reason for the video playback issue could be the computer hardware, such as an old computer. If you want to play games, it's better to upgrade your memory to 2GB and replace your graphics card with GTS450. You don't need to invest too much in the configuration.
