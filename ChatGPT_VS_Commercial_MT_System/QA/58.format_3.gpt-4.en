After downloading and installing Youku, it can't play videos. What could be the reason? Youku on mobile only supports hardware decoding, and it will work if the mobile CPU supports it. It used to work before, but after I reset my phone to factory settings, it became like this. The issue could be due to different reasons in the video or computer hardware problems. For example, if you have an older computer and you want to play games, it might not work. If you want to upgrade, I suggest adding a 2GB memory stick and replacing the graphics card with a GTS450. There's no need to invest too much in the configuration.
