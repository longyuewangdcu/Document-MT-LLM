Does it make sense to replace the CPU if it doesn't perform well? Your motherboard is also very old, and current mainstream processors are not supported. If you want to replace the processor, you will also need to replace the motherboard. In this case, it's better to build a completely new system. Regarding the issue of restoring the system, please consult an expert. You can enter the BIOS and then start the computer. Look for a ""One-Key Restore"" option on the desktop. However, this is only possible if you have backed up your data. If you can't start the computer, you may need to restore the system.
