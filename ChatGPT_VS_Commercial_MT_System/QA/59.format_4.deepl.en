This motherboard is also very old, now the mainstream processors are not supported, to change the processor, then the motherboard should also be replaced, so that a full set to replace, it is better to assemble a brand new ~ that is to restore please God point, with into the BIOS directly into the boot, look at the desktop will appear a key restore. The premise is that you backed up. The problem can not be turned on ah need to restore the system
