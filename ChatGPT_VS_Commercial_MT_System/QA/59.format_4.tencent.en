I think the CPU doesn't work. Is it necessary to change it? Your motherboard is also very old. Now the mainstream processors don't support it. If you want to change the processor, you have to change the motherboard. In this way, the whole set has to be replaced. It's better to assemble a new one. That is the restoration. Please guide the gods. Use the BIOS to boot directly. Look at the desktop and there will be a one-click restore. The premise is that you have backed up. The problem cannot be opened. You need to restore the system.
