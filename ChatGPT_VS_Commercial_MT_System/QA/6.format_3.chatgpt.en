I am currently at 180 pounds and am trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, when I wake up, I want to eat meat. Maybe my stomach capacity has become too large, but I need to gradually control myself. I am currently eating instant noodles and chicken drumsticks, and I can't control myself! Does this mean I am hopeless? It depends on how strong your motivation to lose weight is. Don't eat anymore, stop now! I am currently at 180 pounds and am trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, when I wake up, I want to eat meat. It's okay, go ahead and eat! But try to walk more and do more exercise on the playground. Whenever I walk, my legs hurt, and I can't even run.
