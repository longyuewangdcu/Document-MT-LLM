I am currently 180 jin (about 90 kg) and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, when I wake up, I just want to eat meat. Have I trained my stomach capacity too large? Take it step by step, and restrain yourself. I am eating instant noodles and chicken legs right now, I can't control myself! Do you really want people to say you're beyond help? It depends on how strong your motivation to lose weight is. Stop eating, stop right now! I am currently 180 jin and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, when I wake up, I just want to eat meat. It's okay, you can eat! However, walk more on the playground, run more, and exercise more. My legs hurt as soon as I start walking, and I can't run at all.
