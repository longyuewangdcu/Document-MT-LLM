Why did the verification fail when I followed the prompts to enter the verification code during WeChat registration? I just logged in using my QQ account instead. I don't have a QQ account and don't know how to apply for one. I should apply for one. I ask myself, should I sit in the office every day drinking tea, browsing the internet, watching movies, and making business calls, or should I travel to various places to visit clients in person? The latter is more effective, but it's also more expensive. I already owe 400,000 yuan in interest, which is a huge burden. However, if I want to gain something, I must give up something. Can I really connect with clients just by making phone calls? It's not enough to just have a sincere attitude. That makes sense.
