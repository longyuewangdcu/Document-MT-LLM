Why did I follow the prompts and enter the verification code when registering for WeChat, but it still shows verification failed? Just log in directly with your QQ number. I don't have a QQ number, and I don't know how to apply for one. Go apply for one. Asking myself, which is more effective: sitting in the office every day, drinking tea, surfing the internet, watching movies, making phone calls to connect with clients, or driving around to visit clients in person every day? The latter is obviously more effective than the former. But it costs a lot of money; I'm already 400,000 in debt with huge pressure from interest. Be willing to invest; there must be gains if you make sacrifices. Can you connect with clients by just making phone calls? There's not enough sincerity. That makes sense.
