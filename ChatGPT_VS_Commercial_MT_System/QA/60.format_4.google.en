Why did I enter the verification code according to the prompts when I registered WeChat, but I would prompt the verification failed above? With the QQ number directly, I have no QQ number.	 Drinking tea online, watching movies, calling for business and driving every day to visit and visit the business. The latter effect is obviously stronger than the former, but spending more money. I owe 400,000 interests.	 Can you contact the business by calling?	 Sincerity is not enough.	 Make sense
