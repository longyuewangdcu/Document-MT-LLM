Why did I enter the Captcha according to the above prompt when I registered WeChat, but the above prompt failed to verify? Log in directly with qq number. Without QQ number, I won't apply to apply for one. Ask about my own business. Sitting in the office every day drinking tea, surfing the Internet, watching movies, calling to contact business and driving to visit and contact business every day. The latter is obviously better than the former, but it costs a lot of money. It's a mountain of pressure to owe 400,000 yuan of interest. I'm willing to bear it.There must be something to give. Can you contact the business by phone? Sincerity is not enough. Makes sense
