Playing League of Legends is really demanding, because I don't want my graphics card to be too poor. Originally, my graphics card was over 500, but it's now old and I was advised to switch to playing LOL. Yeah, that jerk who fixed my computer charged me an extra 100 yuan and gave me a second-hand graphics card. If I upgrade to a better graphics card, will it still be slow? It's unlikely that just upgrading the graphics card alone will solve the problem, since your overall system configuration may not be high enough. Okay.
