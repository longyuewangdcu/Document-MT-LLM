Playing League of Legends is so laggy, I don't want to admit my graphics card is too crappy. My graphics card originally had over 500 (specs/price), but it's too old now. I suggest changing it if you want to play LoL. Yeah, that jerk who repaired my computer took 100 yuan from me, and the graphics card is still second-hand. If I change to a better graphics card, will it not be laggy? It's impossible not to lag if you change to a better graphics card since your overall system configuration isn't high, but changing the graphics card will relatively improve the situation a lot. Alright then.
