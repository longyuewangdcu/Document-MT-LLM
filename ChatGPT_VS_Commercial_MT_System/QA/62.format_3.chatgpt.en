Why does my phone's browser display a blank page no matter what website I try to open? Why can't I open anything at all? It could be because of poor network signal, even though the Wi-Fi signal I'm using appears to be strong. I've tried deleting and re-downloading the browser, but it didn't work. Please accept my answer.
