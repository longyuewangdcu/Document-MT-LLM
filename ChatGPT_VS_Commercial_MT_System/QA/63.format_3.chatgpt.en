Why does my phone's browser show blank pages for any website I try to open? Why can't I open anything at all? I tried using a different browser but it didn't work either. It seems like my phone has been infected with a virus. How can I fix this? If not, it could be a problem with the host. I don't know, maybe I should call a professional to fix it.
