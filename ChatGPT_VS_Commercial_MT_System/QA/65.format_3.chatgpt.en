Is it easy to find a job after graduating from Liaoning University of Science and Technology with an associate degree? Are there any problems with undergraduate programs, and is it a mistake for female students to study accounting in a vocational program where the technical skills are strong? Do you know about Liaoning University of Science and Technology? I'm not familiar with it, is it a university? It is a second-tier university, but it also has a first-tier program. Oh, I see. So it has a program at the first-tier level but the overall university is at the second-tier level. Yes, that's right.
