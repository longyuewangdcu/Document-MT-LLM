Why does League of Legends keep crashing and showing ""virtual memory too low"" even though my computer specs are good enough to play the game and I have only opened a web page game outside of it? The virtual memory warning should be caused by the web page taking up too much memory. I have followed the steps to fix the problem by downloading Driver Booster and updating my drivers, but it didn't work and the game still crashes, as of 1 minute ago. Try updating your graphics card driver, but don't choose the latest one, choose the most stable one. Your memory is already sufficient, and your processor exceeds 2.0 GHz, so you should be able to play the game. Try downloading Driver Booster and updating your drivers, it should solve the problem. I have followed the steps to fix the problem by downloading Driver Booster and updating my drivers, but it didn't work and the game still crashes. Right-click on ""My Computer"", select ""Properties"", then select ""Advanced"", and click on ""Performance Settings"". Click on ""Advanced"" and then click on ""Virtual Memory"". Change the value to 1.5 times your memory and it should be fixed.
