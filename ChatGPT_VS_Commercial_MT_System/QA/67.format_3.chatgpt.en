How about using a hard fork in Java? For the Duke 600, should I replace it with a half-carbon or full-carbon? I'm considering it, but also afraid of spending too much money on a full-carbon. Should I go for the Shimano SLX or Deore? Can this be upgraded with a new graphics card? Your motherboard has a dedicated graphics card slot, so you can use a dedicated graphics card. It seems like there's no slot on the current graphics card. Can this still be upgraded with a new graphics card? Yes, but it wouldn't make much sense to upgrade since the current one is already bad. Even if you have a good graphics card, it won't help much. Can I replace both the motherboard and graphics card together? Yes, it's possible. I would recommend replacing them together with the CPU. What kind of replacement would be more functional? How is the fiber optic network charged? Our telecommunications company charges 1200 yuan per year for a 20Mbps plan. Can individuals apply for this plan as well, for personal home use? You can bring your ID card to the business office to apply for it. We live in a rural area and are afraid they won't provide the necessary cables. Which telecom company is commonly used in your village, China Telecom, China Mobile, or China Unicom? To be honest, nobody in our village has had a cable installed yet. I will be the first one. I suggest going to the business office in your local county town to inquire about the service.
