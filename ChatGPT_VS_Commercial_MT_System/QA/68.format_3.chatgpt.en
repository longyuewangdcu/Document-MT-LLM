Can you recommend a good-looking and personalized desktop? Is it for a smaller system desktop? Excuse me, are you looking for a phone or a computer desktop? If you want a phone desktop, I can quickly send you some selected personalized phone desktops. As for phone desktops, how about downloading 91 Desktop? I think that software is pretty good. It's for a phone, but it's better if it's smaller and easier to fit into the system. The icon display should also be smaller. Thank you. What is the size of your phone screen, approximately in pixels? It is system 4.1.2 and the screen is 4.0.
