Recommend a good-looking and unique desktop wallpaper! A smaller one is better for fitting the system. Desktop? Dear, do you want a mobile or computer desktop? If you want a mobile desktop, I will quickly send you some selected unique mobile desktop wallpapers. If it's for a mobile phone, why don't you try downloading the 91 Desktop? I think that software is pretty good. For the mobile phone, but a smaller one is better. It's easier to fit into the system. The display icons should be smaller too. Thank you. What is the approximate size of your phone's screen in pixels? The system is 4.1.2 and the screen size is 4.0 inches.
