Is there any software that can completely change the background of a photo? How about trying Meitu Xiuxiu? No, it can only add a mosaic effect. How about Baidu Motu? None of them work. There is a software called Photoshop Express in English, try it out. But it's all in English and I can't understand it at all. Well, there's nothing we can do, this is the most professional one! Hahaha, thanks. You're welcome, sorry we couldn't solve the problem. Is there any software that can completely change the background of a photo? Can I use Photoshop on my phone? Can you check if there is a mobile version available? Yes, but they are all in English. Then I can't do anything about it! You have to figure it out yourself! Or you can do it on your computer and then transfer it to your phone when it's done! Oh, I see.
