Is there a software that can completely change the background wall of a photo? Try Meitu Xiuxiu. No, it can only do mosaic. How about Baidu Motu? None of them work. There is an English software, I can't remember the name... Photoshop Express, try it. It's all in English, I can't understand it at all. Well, there's no other way, this is the most professional one! Haha, thanks anyway. You're welcome, sorry I couldn't solve the problem. Is there a software that can completely change the background wall of a photo? Can Photoshop be used on a phone? Can you check if there's a mobile version? Yes, but it's all in English. Then I'm helpless! You'll have to figure it out by yourself! Or you can do it on the computer and transfer it to your phone after it's done! Oh, okay.
