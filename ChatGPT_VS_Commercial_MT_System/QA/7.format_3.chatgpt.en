I am currently at 180 pounds and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, when I wake up I want to eat meat. Do I lack willpower to lose weight? I must persevere! "I am eating it now." Don't worry, just stir-fry some Sichuan peppercorns to go with the wine. It's very uncomfortable.
