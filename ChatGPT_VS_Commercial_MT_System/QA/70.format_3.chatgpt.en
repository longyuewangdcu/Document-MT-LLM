Why is it that when I use 4s to check for nearby people, I can see others but they can't see me? Please help. I have turned on location and tried restarting it multiple times. It's like WeChat, should I delete and reinstall it with the updated version? The system is different and software information updates slowly, so I can wait for a day and try again. Can someone tell me what's wrong with my tablet? It shows three bars of WiFi, but why can't it connect to the internet while other devices can? I went to WiFi settings and tried changing it from DHC P to DHCP. It's now DHCP but still not working. The signal varies from one bar to three bars. Can someone tell me what's wrong with my tablet? It shows three bars of WiFi, but why can't it connect to the internet while other devices can? Have you tried restarting it? If that doesn't work, try going closer to the WiFi source. If that doesn't work either, you may need to reset it. I just reset it today. I tried it again and it showed full bars but still didn't work. My WiFi signal keeps dropping, what's going on? You can try resetting your router's WiFi settings. That means resetting the router and creating a new WiFi network. Is that possible? Sometimes the router may have issues, but most of the time it's not the case. However, now we have to try everything we can. Can you try connecting to someone else's WiFi to see if it works?
