Can anyone tell me what's wrong with my tablet? The WIFI has three bars, but why can't it connect to the internet? Other devices can connect, but not my tablet. The router is fine because other devices can connect to it. Someone else with the same brand of tablet said they didn't have this problem. If the WIFI can connect, then try restarting the tablet. Is the n12 single-core or...? I'm currently replying to you using the original mini one. Someone suggested I restart it, but it still doesn't work. I looked up the configuration of the n12 and it has low-end hardware, similar to my Teclast a10t. Android hardware updates too quickly. As hardware is updated, software is also updated, so low-end hardware can't keep up with new software. Your tablet probably can only be used as an mp3 player now. I've had it for two years and have an emotional attachment to it, so I don't want to get rid of it. But there's no choice, the hardware is too low, but it might still be able to run certain games. Original brand tablets are not that good, so I suggest buying something else. Anyway, now I have a mini one. It's best to buy the newest tablet. The hardware of Android tablets probably won't be updated much now, and these updates won't necessarily update the software. So currently, it's best to buy an octa-core tablet that can be used for a long time.
