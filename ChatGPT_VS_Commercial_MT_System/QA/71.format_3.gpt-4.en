Who can tell me what's wrong with my tablet? The Wi-Fi has three bars, but I can't connect to the internet. Other devices can connect just fine. I can't use the browser either. The router isn't the problem since other devices work well. I'm currently replying with another device from the same brand. I'm using a YuanDao N80 and I don't have this problem. If you can connect to Wi-Fi, try restarting your device and see if that helps. Is the N12 single-core or... I'm replying to you with a YuanDao Mini One right now. Someone asked me to restart it, but it still doesn't work. I looked up the specs of the N12, and the hardware is too low-end, just like my Taipower A10T; it can't handle many games. Android hardware is updated too quickly. As hardware updates, so does the software, and low-end hardware can't keep up with new software. Your device might only be good for an MP3 player now. I've been using it for two years and have grown attached to it; I don't want to let it go. There's no other choice but to throw it away. The hardware is too low-end, but it might still be able to run some games. YuanDao is not very good; I suggest buying something else. Well, I'll think about it later; I still have a Mini One for now. !	You've reached the current usage cap for GPT-4. You can continue with the default model now, or try again after 8:40 PM.
