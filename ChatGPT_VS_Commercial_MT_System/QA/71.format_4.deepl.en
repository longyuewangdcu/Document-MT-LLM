Who can tell me how my tablet is WIFI has three frames but why can't I connect to the Internet so that other devices are good to connect is that the browser can't get on the router is fine because other devices are good to use I first just make another machine of the original road in reply I use the original road n80, no you have this problem. If the wifi works, then you should reboot and see if it works. n12 is single core or ...... I am now and you reply with the original road mini one first a person let me reboot but still not good I googled the n12 configuration, this hardware is too low, and my Taipower a10t like many can not play. Android hardware updates are too fast. Once the hardware is updated, the software is also updated, so the low hardware will not be able to keep up with the new software. You can only use that one as an mp3, I guess. Uh this is mainly to make two years have feelings do not want it to die no way, throw it away. Hardware is too low, but may be some games can still be used. The original road is worse, it is recommended to buy other Ugh say it now there is a mini one The best way to buy a tablet is to buy a new one. Now Android tablet hardware is estimated not how to update, these updates will not make the software is also updated, so the best way to buy a tablet to buy eight-core, can be used for a long time.
