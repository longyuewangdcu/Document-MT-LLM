Who can tell me what is my tablet? WIFI has three grids, but why do n’t even make other devices even make the moweur, but the router can’t get the router.	 Another machine is replying to my use of the original N80, without your problem.	 If the wifi can go, then you restart to see if you can?	 Is the N12 single core or ... The single core I use to reply with you now is the original MINI One who made me restart, but it is difficult to make me check the configuration of the N12 online. This hardware is too low.	 I ca n’t play as much as my Taipower A10T.	 Android hardware updates are too fast.	 As soon as the hardware is updated, the software is updated, so low hardware cannot keep up with new software.	 Your estimate can only be a MP3.	 Uh, this is mainly for two years. After two years, I have no way to die. Throw it away.	 The hardware is too low, but some games may still be used.	 The original road is poor, it is recommended to buy other 再, let's talk about it now, there is still a mini one It is best to buy new ones.	 Now the Android tablet hardware is estimated to not be updated, and these updates will not make the software update, so it is best to buy an octa -core at present, which can be used for a long time.
