Who can tell me what's wrong with my tablet? WIFI has three bars, but why can't I connect to the Internet? Make other devices work even if the browser can't get on the router. No problem because other devices work. I'll just use another machine of the original channel to reply. I'm using the original channel n80. There's no problem with you. If the wifi works,Then you can restart it and see if it works. Is the n12 single-core or ...... single-core? I'm using the original mini one to reply to you now. Someone asked me to restart it first, but it still doesn't work. I checked the configuration of the n12 online. The hardware is too low. It's the same as my Taipower a10t. I can't play many of them. The Android hardware updates too fast. Once the hardware is updated, the software is also updated.That's it. The hardware is so low that it can't keep up with the new software. I guess your one can only be used as an mp3. The main reason is that I've been using it for two years. I have feelings for it. I can't bear to let it die. I'll throw it away. The hardware is too low, but maybe some games can still be used. The original road is relatively poor. I suggest buying another one. Sigh. Let's see. There's also a mini one now It is best to buy a new tablet. Now the Android tablet hardware is not expected to be updated, and these updates will not update the software, so it is best to buy an eight-core tablet for a long time.
