Have you ever used the homework help software called "作业帮" (Zuoyebang)? Do you think it's easy or difficult to use? I feel like people in there are just chatting about irrelevant things, and there aren't really many questions about homework. When I posted my homework questions, I wanted to get some ideas, not to ask someone else to do the work for me. What I meant was that the questions I posted were ones that I had been thinking about for a long time but didn't understand, not questions that I was too lazy to do myself and wanted someone else to do for me.
