Have you ever used the Homework Helper software? Do you think it's good or not? I feel that people inside are mostly talking about irrelevant things, and there are very few real homework questions. When I posted my own question, someone replied, "Just write it yourself." What do they mean? The homework I posted was a problem that I thought about for a long time and couldn't understand. It's not something I'm too lazy to do and want others to do for me.
