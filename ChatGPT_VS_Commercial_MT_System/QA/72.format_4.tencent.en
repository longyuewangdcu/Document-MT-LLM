I have a lot of questions about this software. I think it's not easy to use it. I think it's all about talking about things that don 't matter. I don' t really have much homework to ask. Send it up and write it yourself. What else do you think? The homework I sent up was a topic I thought I didn 't understand for a long time. It's not a topic I'm too lazy to do and let others do
