How should I proceed after installing PPT 2007? Double-click the icon to open it. If there is no response after double-clicking "continue", check the start menu for PPT 2007. If it's not there, reinstall Office 2007. I'm at the desktop step, should I unzip it or what should I do? What software did you use to install it? Can you show me a screenshot? It's just a website address, I couldn't find it on eDonkey.
