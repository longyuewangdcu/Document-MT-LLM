Install ppt 2007, what should I do after that? Double-click this icon, open. After double-clicking continue, there is no response. First check if the Start menu has PPT 2007. It doesn't. Reinstall Office 2007, then it's there. I'm at the desktop step, then should I unzip or what should I do? What software did you use to install it, can you take a screenshot for me to see? It's directly a web address. I couldn't find it on eDonkey.
