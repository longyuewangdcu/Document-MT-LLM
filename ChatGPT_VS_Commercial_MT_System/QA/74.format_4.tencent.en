What should I do after installing PPT 2007?? Double-click this icon to open it. Double-click to continue. There is no response. First look at the start menu to see if there is PPT 2007. There is no reinstall of office 2007. I just went to the desktop step, and then should I decompress or what should I do?? What software did you use to install it? Can you show me a screenshot? It is directly a URL. Not found on eMule
