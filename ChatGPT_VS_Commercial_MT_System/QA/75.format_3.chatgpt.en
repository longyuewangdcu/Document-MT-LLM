The computer originally had the Windows 8 (WN8) system. I want to change to Windows 7, but encounter this problem. Does anyone know how to solve it? The hard disk format of W8 and W7 is different, so it needs to be formatted, repartitioned, and then reinstalled. Can you provide a detailed explanation of how you installed the system? Did you use a CD or a USB flash drive? The computer failed to install the system. Has the system been successfully installed? No system is currently installed. You haven't even installed the system yet. How can you enter it?
