The computer originally had a Windows 8 system. Now I want to change it to Windows 7, but I encountered this issue. Any experts know what to do? Windows 8 and Windows 7 have different hard disk formats. You need to format and repartition, then reinstall. Please explain in detail. What method did you use to install the system? I have both CDs and USB drives. The computer installation failed. Is the system installed yet? No system. No system for now. You haven't even installed it. How can you get in?
