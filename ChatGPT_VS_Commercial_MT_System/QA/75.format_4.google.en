Computer original WN8 system.	 I want to change win7 but this appears.	 Which big god knows what to do? The hard disk format of W8 and W7 is different. After formatting, re -partition is required, and then I pretend to explain in the details of the system CD U disk. There are computer installation failure system installed?	 There is no system, there is no system, you haven't even installed it.	 How can I enter?
