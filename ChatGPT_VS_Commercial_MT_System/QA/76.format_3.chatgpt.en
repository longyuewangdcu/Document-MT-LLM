At noon today, I had some bok choy from the school cafeteria, which had a strong smell of alcohol. I only ate a small piece. Will there be any problem? Don't worry, if there is any issue with the school food, they will have a great responsibility. Since you only ate a small piece, there should be no problem. It smells a bit like an anesthetic. Do you know what's going on?
