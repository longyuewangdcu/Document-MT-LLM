The Chinese sentences translate to:	"Today at noon, the school's cafeteria food had a strong alcohol taste. I only ate a small piece, will there be any issues? Don't worry, if there's a problem with the school food, they will have a major responsibility, so just eating a small piece is totally fine. It tasted a bit like an anesthetic, do you know what's going on?"
