I ate a small piece of school food at noon today. It smelled like alcohol. I only ate a small piece. Will it be okay? Don't worry. There's something wrong with the school food. I should be responsible. I only ate a small piece. It's completely fine. It tastes a bit like anesthetic. Do you know what's going on
