Where is the best place to buy a Telecom version of an unlocked iPhone 4S that is both cost-effective and ensures that it is authentic? If you want a cost-effective and authentic phone, then you should choose a contract phone, which comes with a lock. China Telecom calculates your expenses down to every day, so the contract phone is the best option. Unfortunately, it has a lock. Therefore, you should buy it from a physical store. The price may not be the cheapest, and online purchases cannot guarantee that the product is genuine. Shopping has risks, but you can check the usage of the phone based on its serial number after receiving it.
