I want to buy an iPhone 4s CDMA version without a contract. Where can I buy it at the best price and ensure it's genuine? The most cost-effective option is a contract phone, but I only want the phone without a contract. Contract phones are locked. If you want the best price and a genuine product, then a contract phone is definitely the most cost-effective. China Telecom even calculates the daily cost for you. Unfortunately, it's locked. So, go to a brick-and-mortar store to buy it. The price may not be the cheapest, and you can't guarantee the authenticity of products online. Shopping has its risks. Once you get the device, you can check its usage information by the serial number.
