Can you use game cards to buy the CD-key for Guild Wars 2 on the official website? It now requires an activation code. I'm talking about the public beta CD-keys that were released on April 1st. My computer screen is black when I turn it on, and restarting it doesn't work. Is the computer turning on? Is the monitor receiving power? There is a display for Windows updates. How should I buy a good computer for gaming? What do you want to use it for specifically? Playing games? Look for recommended system requirements on the game's official website to determine what games you want to play.
