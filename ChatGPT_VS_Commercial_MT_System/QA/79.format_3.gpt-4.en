Can I buy the cd-key for Guild Wars 2 with AirNet Points using a point card? It already requires an activation code now. I mean the open beta cd-key that starts selling on April 1st. The computer screen is black when it starts up, and rebooting doesn't help. Does the computer monitor react when the computer is turned on, and is the main unit powered on? There is a display of Windows updating. What kind of computer should I buy? What specific purpose do you want to use it for? For playing games. What specific games do you want to play? Look for the recommended configurations on the game's official website.
