Can this machine install Windows 7? Yes, it can. You can install the 64-bit version of Windows 7. I don't really want to buy a Windows 7 disk, and I don't know how to use a USB drive to create an image. You can download a copy of Windows 7 online and save it to the last drive. Then download a software called ""One-Key System Restore"" and save it to the last drive as well. First, create a folder and make sure to remember its name. Then put the downloaded files in the folder and extract them. Finally, open the One-Key System Restore software and restore the system.
