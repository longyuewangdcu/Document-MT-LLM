Can this machine install Windows 7? Yes, it can install the 64-bit version of Windows 7. I don't really want to buy a Windows 7 disc, and I don't know how to use a USB image. What should I do? Download a Windows 7 image from the internet and place it in the last partition of your hard drive. Then, download a software called "One-Click Restore Wizard" and install it in the same partition. First, put the downloaded files in a folder, and remember the folder name. Next, extract the files in that folder. Finally, open the One-Click Restore Wizard and restore the system, and you're good to go.
