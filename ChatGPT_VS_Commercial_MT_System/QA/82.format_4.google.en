Can this machine be equipped with Win7? I can install 64 -bit Win7. I don't want to buy a win7 disk. I donâ€™t want to download it on the last disk with the U disk mirror image.	 It is also installed in the last plate. First put the downloaded file in a folder. Pay attention to the folder name, then unzip it in this folder, then open a click to restore the elves, the restore system is enough
