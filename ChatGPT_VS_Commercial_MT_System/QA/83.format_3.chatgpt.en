During the renovation, a wired television cable and a red and white audio cable were buried. The set-top box that came out had red, white, and yellow cables, but was missing a yellow cable. Can I use the wired television cable to connect to the yellow plug? By the way, can you make sure the connection points are properly linked when making the changes to the wires? As long as the connection points are linked properly, can I use any type of wire? Yes, as long as it is the same type of wire. The color-coding of the wires is for you to accurately connect the two ends together. It is not the same type of wire! It is an old wired television cable! Can it be used as the yellow cable for the AV three-color cable? Yes, it can.
