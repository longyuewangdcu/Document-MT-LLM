When renovating, a cable TV wire and a red and white audio wire were buried, and the set-top box came out with red, white, and yellow, missing a yellow wire. Can I use the cable TV wire with a yellow head, and fix the connection point while I'm at it? As long as the connection points are connected well, the wire can be used, right? Yes, as long as it's the same type of wire. The wires are color-coded so that you can accurately connect both ends correctly. It's not the same type of wire! It's an old cable TV wire! Can it be used as the yellow wire in the AV tri-color wire? Yes.
