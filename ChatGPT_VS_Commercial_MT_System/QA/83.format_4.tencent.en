When decorating, I buried a cable TV line and a red and white audio line. The set-top box came out with a red, white and yellow difference. A yellow line. Can you take the cable TV line and connect it to a yellow head? By the way, make a more line. As long as the contact point is connected, the line can be used. Yes? Well, as long as it is the same type of line, the color of the line is for you to accurately link the two ends correctly. It is not the same type of line! It is an old cable TV line! Can it be used as the yellow line of the av tricolor line? Yes
