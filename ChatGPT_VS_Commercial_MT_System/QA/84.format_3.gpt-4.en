When decorating, I buried a cable TV line and a red and white audio line. The set-top box has red, white, and yellow outputs, but I'm missing the yellow cable. Can I use the cable TV line with a yellow head and use one less audio line as a video line? Note: I buried an old cable TV line and don't want to run any more exposed wires. I want to use the old cable TV line I buried as the yellow video line of the three-color line. Is it possible? Yesterday, the internet was working fine, but today I can't connect to the broadband, showing error 651. I connected to the router, and even after unplugging and reconnecting the network cable, it still doesn't work. However, when I connect to the router, I can access the internet, but the remote computer does not respond. The network cable issue has been reported to the broadband customer service. When connected to the router, my phone also can't access the internet. Sigh. It could be a problem with your settings or the network cable. You can call customer service and have them come over and take a look tomorrow. Your answer perfectly solved my problem! Thank you so much!
