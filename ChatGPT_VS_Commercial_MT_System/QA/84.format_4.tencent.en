When the decoration buried a cable TV line and red and white audio cable set-top box out of the red, white and yellow difference of a yellow line can take the cable TV line with a yellow head with less an audio line when the video line has to pay attention to the reading:I buried the old cable TV line, and I don't want to run the open line any more. I just want to use the old cable TV line I buried as a yellow video line for the tricolor line. Is it OK? Yesterday the network was very normal. Today I can't connect to the broadband. It shows 651. I connected the router. It still doesn't work when I unplug the hair and connect the network cable. But when I connect the router, I can surf the Internet like a remote computer does not respond. The network cable problem calls the broadband customer service and I can't connect the router to the mobile phone.Alas, you set up a problem or cable problems, you can call customer service, let them come over tomorrow to see too much to force, your answer to solve my problem perfectly!
