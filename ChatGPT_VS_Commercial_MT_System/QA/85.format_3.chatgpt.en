Where do restored files from the recycle bin go? Can you download a software to recover deleted files? Some software can retrieve them, but I forgot the name, it's in English and very long. You can try searching on Baidu for "software to recover deleted files," there should be many options. If the real name on the Netease Bao account is different from the cardholder name, how can I transfer money to the card? Contact customer service and ask for the real name to match the name on the Netease Bao account. Changing the registered name on Netease Bao seems to be troublesome, so it's best to inquire with customer service to find a solution.
