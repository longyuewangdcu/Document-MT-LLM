Where can I find the file after it has been restored from the recycle bin? You can download a software to recover deleted files, some of them can retrieve the files. What software? I forgot the name, it's an English name, very long. You can try searching on Baidu for "software to recover deleted files", there should be many options. If the real name and cardholder's name in NetEase Pay do not match, how can I transfer money to the card?!!? You should contact customer service and request the real name and NetEase Pay registered name to be the same~ Is there no other way?? Changing the registered name in NetEase Pay seems to be more complicated, it's better for you to contact customer service to understand the process~
