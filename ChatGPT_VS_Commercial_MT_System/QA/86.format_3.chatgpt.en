Why is there no activity on the WAN? Maybe the Ethernet cable is not plugged in properly or the password/account is incorrect. But why can I receive a Wi-Fi signal? My phone cannot connect to the Internet. If the router has power, the phone should be able to find the WAN, and if the LAN is working, the phone should be able to connect to the Internet.
