How come there's no internet activity? The network cable may not be plugged in properly or the username/password is incorrect. Why can I still receive a WiFi signal then? It means the phone cannot connect to the internet. If the router has power, the phone can definitely detect the WiFi signal. If the WAN (Wide Area Network) is working, the computer can access the internet; if the LAN (Local Area Network) is working, the phone can access the internet.
