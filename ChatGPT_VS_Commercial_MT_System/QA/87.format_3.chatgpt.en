Can I set up the router on my phone? You must use a computer to set up the router. The two screenshots earlier were taken on my phone. You should set it up using a computer. The LAN port of my Asus laptop is a snap-on design. The Ethernet cable is loose and I need to use something to prop it up to connect to the internet. How can I fix this? If it is unlikely to be caused by other factors, try using a network cable with a standard crystal head. If it works, it is recommended to contact Asus sales support. I don't know if the cable I bought from the school store has a standard crystal head. I just randomly picked one. Can I ask where I can find Ethernet cables with more standardized crystal heads?
