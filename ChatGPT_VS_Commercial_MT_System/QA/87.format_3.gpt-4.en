Can I set up the router on my phone? You must use a computer to set up the router. The two screenshots I just sent are from my phone. Please use a computer to set it up. The ASUS laptop's Ethernet port is a buckle-type, and the cable is loose when connected. I need to use something to hold it in place to connect to the internet. How can I solve this? If you encounter this situation, it's possible that using a standard RJ45 cable might work. I suggest contacting ASUS support. I'm not sure if it's a standard RJ45 connector... I just bought it randomly from the school's store. Where can I usually find a cable with a more standard RJ45 connector?
