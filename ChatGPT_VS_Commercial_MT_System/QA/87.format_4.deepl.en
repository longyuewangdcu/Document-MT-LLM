Can I set up a router if I enter the router on my phone? The two screenshots are the screenshots I took on my cell phone. You can use your computer to set up the Asus laptop network cable interface is snap-on, the network cable is connected to the loose, you have to use something to top it to network, how do I solve it? The situation can be small to determine with a standard crystal head network cable tried okay suggest contact Asus sales do not know if it is a standard crystal head. I just bought one at the school store. I'm not sure if it's standard.
