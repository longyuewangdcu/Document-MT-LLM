Can I set up the router if I enter the router on my mobile phone? I have to use a computer to set up the router. The two screenshots just now are the screenshots I took on my mobile phone. If you use a computer to set up the ASUS laptop's network cable interface, it is snap-in. The network cable is loosely connected. You have to use something to hold it up before you can connect to the network.How to solve this problem? There is a small possibility to determine the use of a standard cable with a crystal head tried OK suggested contact ASUS sales do not know is not a standard crystal head .. Is in the school's store to buy a random .. That can ask where the general sale of the cable's crystal head is more standard?
