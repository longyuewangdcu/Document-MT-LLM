I've jailbroken my iPhone 4, but why can't I install the themes after downloading them? There's a problem with the jailbreak, how can I solve this issue? What should I do if my computer keeps showing the message 'unable to connect to the network' for several hours? You need to pay the bill or terminate the service to resolve this issue. If there is no overdue bill, 'unbinding' the service might help. What does 'unbinding' mean? If you have a password error or overdue bill, you should call the local service center.  Oh, the call can't get through. They've finished work now. I'll call tomorrow. Tell them that your account number 691 has no overdue bills or password errors, and ask them to help you unbind it. Okay, I'll give it a try.
