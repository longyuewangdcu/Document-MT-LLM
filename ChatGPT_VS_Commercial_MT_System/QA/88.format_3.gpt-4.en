The iPhone 4 has been jailbroken, so why can't I install themes after downloading them? There is a problem with the jailbreak, how can I solve this issue? Reinstall the system. My computer always cannot connect to the network, what should I do with this prompt, it has been going on for a few hours now. First, check for unpaid bills; second, unbind the device. There are no unpaid bills, what does "unbind" mean? There might also be a password error. If there is no password issue or unpaid bills, you should call your local service center. Ah, I can't get through. They are off work now, I'll try again tomorrow. Tell them your account number is 691, and there are no unpaid bills or password errors, and ask them to unbind it for you. Alright, I'll give it a try.
