I'm currently at 180 pounds and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do, especially at night when I wake up wanting to eat meat? Am I hopeless? Playing computer and phone games can help distract me, and I play them every day while eating. You're awesome.
