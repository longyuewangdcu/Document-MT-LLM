I am currently 180 jin (approximately 90 kg) and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, I wake up wanting to eat meat. Am I hopeless? What can I do? Playing on the computer or phone to distract myself â€“ I do that every day, eating while playing. You're awesome.
