The computer always fails to connect to the network, and such a prompt appears. What should I do? It has been going on for a few hours and is really troublesome. I can't see it clearly on my phone either, but I can on the computer. Hey, if you can't connect to the internet on your computer, try using someone else's computer later. Maybe there is some operation going on in the background of my phone.
