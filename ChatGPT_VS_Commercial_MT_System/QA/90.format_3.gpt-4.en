The computer always fails to connect to the internet. What should I do when such a prompt appears? It has been going on for several hours. It's bothersome, and I really can't see clearly. My phone is like this too, but I can see clearly on the computer. Well, for those who can't connect to the internet on their computers, try using someone else's computer later. It might be because there are background operations on my phone.
