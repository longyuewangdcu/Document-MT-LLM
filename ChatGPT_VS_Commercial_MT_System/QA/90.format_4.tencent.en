The computer is always unable to connect to the network. What should I do if there is such a prompt? It has been a few hours of trouble. I really can't see my mobile phone. But I can see it clearly on the computer. The computer can't connect to the Internet. I will use someone else's computer to see if there is an operation in the background of my mobile phone.
