"Currently, is it possible to crack wireless networks on mobile phones, and how can it be done? There's a software called ""Universal Unlock"" that works well. Have you tested it yourself? Last October, my mother was hit by someone. After reporting it to the police and going to mediation, the other party was waiting outside with a bunch of agreements, but I didn't think too much of it. Just said to go ahead and settle it. Thank you. Can the court accept the accident determination if there is no accident determination document? Was the police officer present at the scene? The police were there, and there's a record of the private settlement. If not, maybe someone within the police department is involved. You should find a lawyer to help you, and sue them. Some have also gone to the accident processing unit, but now the police officer says they can only give me the agreement, and not the accident determination document." Sue them. If you sue, the police will have to get involved and they will have to handle it. Thank you...
