What software is available to restrict background programs or startup applications on an Android phone, so that they don't automatically start up or run in the background? Hello, if you don't mind using Phone Manager, you can also try 360 Mobile Security or Tencent Mobile Manager. As a volunteer from Tencent, to be honest, 360 is better, but we have to recommend our own company's software. How much is your salary? I used to work at Yixun.com, but they were so unethical. After I quit, they only paid me half my salary. Tencent is also pretty tough. I'm sorry, it's not allowed to discuss salaries within the company. We are just volunteers, so of course our salary is not as high as the employees.
