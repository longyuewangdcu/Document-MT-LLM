What software can restrict Android phone background apps or startup programs, lock them once and prevent them from auto-starting or running in the background? Hello, you can use a phone manager like 360 Mobile Security or Tencent Mobile Manager. I am a Tencent volunteer and, to be honest, 360 is quite good. However, we have to promote our own company's software. How much is your salary? I used to work at Yixun.com, but it was too shady, so I quit. After quitting, my salary was cut in half, and Tencent can be quite ruthless. I'm sorry, but we are not allowed to discuss this in the company. As volunteers, our salaries are, of course, not the same as regular employees'.
