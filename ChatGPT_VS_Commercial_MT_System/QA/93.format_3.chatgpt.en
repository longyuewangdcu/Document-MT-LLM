What software can restrict Android phone background programs or auto-starting programs when booting up, and lock them so they won't restart or run in the background again? Can 360 Mobile Guard be restarted and will it auto-start again? Even the 360 Mobile Assistant on the computer can be modified, I will do it today. With an Intel Core 4th generation I5 4570 3.2G HZ CPU and a Micro-Star B85M-E45 motherboard, this is a high-end configuration. If possible, upgrading to 8GB of RAM would be even better. If the RAM is already 8GB, then it goes without saying that it can handle gaming easily.
