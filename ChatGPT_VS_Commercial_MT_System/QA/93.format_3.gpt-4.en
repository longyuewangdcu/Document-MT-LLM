What software can restrict Android background applications or startup programs, lock them once and prevent them from auto-starting or running in the background? Does 360 Mobile Guard auto-start after rebooting? The 360 Mobile Manager on the computer can be modified, I'll work on it today. Intel Core i5-4570 3.2GHz with a cooler, MSI B85M-E45, it's a high-end configuration for a young person. If possible, upgrading to 8GB of RAM would be even better. The RAM is already 8GB? Well, then there's nothing more to say, it's great for gaming.
