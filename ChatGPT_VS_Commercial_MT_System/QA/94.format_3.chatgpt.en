May I ask how to create a new file using C language? "fopen(const char path, const char mode)" is the function you need. Selecting "w" mode clears the contents of the file and creates a new file when storing, while selecting "a" mode opens the file in append mode for writing only. When using "a" mode, new data will be added to the end of the file. Isn't this function used to open a file? There are only a few functions in the C standard library, and the specific function of "fopen" depends on the selected mode. Alternatively, you can use "tmpfile," but this function is essentially "wb+" and creates a temporary file that will be automatically deleted when closed. Can you recommend a customer relationship management system? You can try to download and try the free trial. If you can't find the download location, you can search on Baidu to access the website and go to the download center to download. Alternatively, you can ask customer service for the link.
