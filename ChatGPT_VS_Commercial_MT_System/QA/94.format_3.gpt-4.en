Please tell me how to create a new file in C language using fopen (const char path, const char mode); choose mode "w" to clear the content when saving and create when saving, choose "a" to open the file in append mode for write-only, creating the file if it doesn't exist and data written will be appended to the end of the file. Isn't this about opening a file? There are only a few functions in the C standard library, and the specific functionality of fopen depends on the chosen mode, or you can use tmpfile, but this is essentially "wb+" and it is a temporary file that will be deleted automatically when the program exits. As for customer relationship management systems, try free downloads and trials. If you can't find the download location, go to Baidu search, access the website, and go to the download center to download it. Or ask customer service for the link.
