Why is it that when I sort my music on Baidu Music, the order gets messed up after I exit and reopen the app? Hmm, what's going on? Is it because my computer has a virus? Don't keep looking at things you shouldn't, you men are all the same. You're a lunatic. It's because of your phone. If it's your phone, then delete it and reinstall it. I've tried that already, I don't have any other suggestions.
