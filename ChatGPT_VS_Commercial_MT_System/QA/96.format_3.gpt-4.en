Why does the order I arranged on Baidu Music get messed up after I exit and reopen it? Huh, what's going on? Your computer has a virus, don't always look at things you shouldn't, you men are all the same. Crazy! It's a phone. If it's a phone, just delete it and try again. I've tried that. Well, I'm out of ideas then.
