I have already added a bank card to my Alipay account. Taobao sellers said they will refund through Alipay. What is the difference between that and refunding to a bank card? When I used Alipay to pay for purchases and received a refund, I clicked on the purchased item in the "already bought" section to see if there was any indication of the refund, such as "refund successful". If your phone is not linked to Alipay, you won't receive any messages. If it is linked, you can check the status of the purchase record to see if it says "refund pending" or "refund successful". What I mean is, after the refund is successful, Alipay shows that the refund has been credited to my account, but the balance is still zero. Did you use Alipay or a bank card to make the payment? I used a bank card to make the payment. The seller doesn't know that I used a bank card, they usually use Alipay, which is why they told me the refund would be made to Alipay. I'm sure the money will be refunded to my bank card, but it might take a bit longer, although it should arrive within one day. I have experience with this.
