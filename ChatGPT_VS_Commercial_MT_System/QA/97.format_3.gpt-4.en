I have already added a bank card to my Alipay. Taobao sellers say they refund the money to Alipay. What's the difference between refunding to Alipay and refunding to a bank card? When I used Alipay on my phone to make a payment and get a refund before, I could see the refund status in the purchase history of the item, such as "refund successful." If your phone is not linked, you won't receive a text message. If it is linked, you can check the purchase history to see the status, whether it's "refunding" or "refund successful." What I mean is that after the refund is successful, Alipay shows the refund has been credited, but the balance is still 0. Did you pay with Alipay or a bank card? I paid with a bank card. The seller said they would refund to my Alipay. The seller doesn't know that you paid with a bank card; generally, they assume it's through Alipay, so that's why they told you this. I can confidently say that the money was definitely refunded to your bank card. However, it might be a bit slower to get refunded to your bank card, but it should definitely be credited within one day. I have experience with this.
