I paypal has added a bank card. Taobao seller refunds are said to be played in Alipay. What is the difference with playing in the bank card. Why do I use my cell phone to pay for refunds with Alipay when the refund bank click on the bought baby in the product purchase record side of the refund also refunded successful and other words to see if your phone is not bound is not SMS bound you can look at the purchase record behind that line. See what the status is, is the refund in or refund success. I mean after a successful refund. Alipay shows the refund to the account. But the balance is still 0 Did you use Alipay or bank card when you made the payment? The payment is a bank card. Receiving a refund is the seller are said to play in Alipay. The seller does not know that you pay with a bank card, usually with Alipay, so you say so, I bet the money back to the bank card, but the refund to the bank card may be a little slower, but within 1 day certainly to the account. This I have experience.
