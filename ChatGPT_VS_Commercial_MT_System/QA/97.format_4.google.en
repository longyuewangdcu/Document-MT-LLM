I have added a bank card.	 Taobao sellers refund that they are fighting in Alipay.	 What is the difference between playing in the bank card?	 Why did I refer to the bank when I paid the refund with Alipay before I used Alipay to refund the purchase record of the purchase record of the buying Babyli product.	 You can watch the purchase record behind that line.	 See what status is, a refund or a successful refund.	 I mean after the refund was successful.	 Alipay showed a refund to the account.	 But the balance is still 0 when you pay, do you use Alipay or a bank card?	 The payment is a bank card.	 The refund was the seller said that the seller said to play Alipay.	 The seller does not know that you pay it with a bank card. Generally, you use Alipay, so I told you that. I dare to say that the money is definitely returned to the bank card, but it may be slower to return to the bank card, but it will definitely arrive in the account within 1 day.	 of.	 I have experience.
