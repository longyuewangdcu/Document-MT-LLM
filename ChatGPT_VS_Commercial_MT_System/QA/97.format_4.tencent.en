I have added a bank card to Alipay. Taobao sellers say that refunds are made in Alipay. What is the difference with refunds made in bank cards? Why did I use Alipay to pay for refunds in my mobile phone before? When I returned to the bank, I clicked the words "Refund is successful" on the purchase record of the purchased goods in the purchased baby to see if your mobile phone is not bound, there will be no SMS binding. You can see the purchase record line. See what the status is.Is the refund in progress or the refund is successful. I mean after the refund is successful. Alipay shows that the refund has been received. But the balance is still 0. Did you use Alipay or a bank card when you paid? The payment was a bank card. The seller said that the refund was made in Alipay. The seller did not know that you paid with a bank card. Generally, it was Alipay. That's why I told you so. I dare say that the money will definitely be refunded to the bank card, but it may take a little longer to return to the bank card.But it will definitely arrive within 1 day. I have experience with this.
