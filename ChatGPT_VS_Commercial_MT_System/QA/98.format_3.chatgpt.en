I have already added a bank card to my Alipay account. Taobao sellers said that refunds would be credited to my Alipay account, so what is the difference between that and a bank card? On my phone, I'm not sure whether you have bound a debit card or a credit card. If it is a credit card, the refund will be directly returned to the credit card, but it may take one or two days. If it is a debit card, you can withdraw the money from your Alipay account to your linked debit card or savings card, and the refund will be displayed in your Alipay account balance. Unless you have already withdrawn the balance, your balance should still be 0. In your case, you should have received a refund of 8 yuan, and you used it to recharge your phone with 10 yuan, so you only paid 2 yuan. However, the transaction details show that the 8 yuan refund has already been credited to your account. You can try transferring the remaining 2 yuan to your bank account. Your account balance should be 0, but it may appear in your Yu'EBao account. The balance of your Yu'EBao account is 0, I'm not sure why, maybe your phone hasn't updated yet. Anyway, I have already added a bank card to my Alipay account. Taobao sellers usually refund the money to your Alipay account, but sometimes they may choose to refund to your bank card instead, depending on their own convenience. When the money is refunded to your Alipay account, you will see the balance increase by the corresponding amount. This is normal, and the refunded money can be automatically used for your next purchase on Taobao, even if it's not enough and needs to be combined with other linked bank cards. It won't affect anything. If you still don't understand, next time you make a purchase on Taobao, the system will automatically remind you that you have this balance available to use. But I didn't receive any reminders. I made another purchase later, but still didn't receive any reminders. You can download the Taobao app on your phone, and it will remind you with a shortcut payment method. You should be able to see the reminder. As for adding a bank card to your Alipay account, if you paid with a card, the refund will be credited back to the same card you used for payment. If you paid with your Alipay balance, the refund will be credited back to your Alipay account. If you paid with online banking, the refund should have been credited to your bank account. Have you checked your bank account? It may take one or two days for the refund to show up. Have you linked your bank account to your Alipay account? Then the refund will be credited to your bank account, so don't worry. Your current issue is that the refund has been received, but it is not showing in your bank account, and your Alipay balance is also showing 0. However, the refund has been recorded in the transaction details.
