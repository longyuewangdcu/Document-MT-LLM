I have already added a bank card to my Alipay. Taobao sellers say they refund the money to Alipay. What's the difference between that and refunding it to the bank card? Why does my phone show whether the card you bound is a debit card or a credit card? If it's a credit card, the refund will be returned directly to the credit card, but it takes one or two days. If it's a debit card, you can withdraw the money from Alipay to the bound debit card, and if it's refunded, it will show as a balance in Alipay. Unless you have already withdrawn the money, the balance will still be 0. You should have received a refund of 8 yuan, and then you charged 10 yuan for your phone bill. In reality, you only paid 2 yuan, so the 8 yuan refund was used for your phone bill. No, the balance of 10 yuan in the payment details is the 8 yuan refunded by the seller. I'll try transferring two yuan myself. But the account balance is 0. Could it be in Yu'e Bao? The balance in Yu'e Bao account is 0. I don't know then; your phone may not have reflected the change. I have already added a bank card to my Alipay. Taobao sellers say they refund the money to Alipay. What's the difference between that and refunding it to the bank card? Why does my phone show this? It depends on the seller's situation. They will do whichever is more convenient! The seller said that they have refunded the money to Alipay, and I can see the added amount in Alipay. Yes, this is normal. As long as the money is refunded to you, the next time you shop on Taobao, you can use this amount even if it's not enough, and it can be automatically combined with other bound bank cards for payment. It doesn't affect anything. I still don't quite understand... Can you explain it in simpler terms from the beginning? Haha. The next time you shop on Taobao, the Taobao system will automatically prompt you that this money can be used. But there was no prompt. I didn't get this prompt when I bought something later. If you install the Taobao app on your phone, you will get the prompt, and you can use the quick payment method. The prompt should definitely be visible. I have already added a bank card to my Alipay. Taobao sellers say they refund the money to Alipay. What's the difference between that and refunding it to the bank card? Why does my phone show this? If you paid with your card, the refund will go to your card! The refund will only go to your Alipay if you paid with your Alipay balance! I paid with online banking. What's the deal with the money being sent to Alipay? Have you checked your card? The card doesn't show anything. It takes one or two days for the money to arrive. Have you bound the card? Yes, I have. Don't worry, the refund will be sent to your card! My current problem is that there's no refund in the card and the Alipay balance also shows 0, but the payment details show that I have received a refund.
