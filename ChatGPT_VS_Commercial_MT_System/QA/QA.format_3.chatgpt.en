Can someone help me check the IP address of this QQ? It's better to have a detailed address. A scammer took 200 yuan from me!!! It's not useful to use QQ IP address proxy to locate only a certain area. Besides, it's not possible to check the address even if the scammer is using QQ. It seems like the scammer is still using QQ. Then you should download a version of QQ that can display IP addresses.
Can someone help me check the IP address of this QQ? It's better to have a detailed address. A scammer came and cheated me out of 200 yuan!!! I suggest you report it to the police, although it may not be useful. IP addresses can only be used to locate a general area. Only knowing the QQ number cannot locate the address. He logged in using his mobile QQ. Why can't he access the internet with mobile data? Check the firewall settings. Where are they set, in the system settings? What is the model of your phone? Check if there is any firewall software installed. It's a Samsung E220. Why can't I access web pages with mobile data? Is the network too slow, like a 2G network? No, it's 3G. Try restarting or changing the browser. If UC doesn't work, try Opera.
Which version of the game "乐动达人" can download songs without having to pay to unlock them? It's unlocked by accumulating "闪光" in the game. What does "撒打我爱上大声地" mean in the Android version?
How can I flash my phone? Different models may have different methods. If your phone supports flashing, you can download a flashing master tool and enable USB debugging on your phone. Connect your phone to your computer, and the master tool will automatically download the necessary drivers. Then, download the ROM package (the firmware you want to flash) to your computer and open it with the flashing tool. Click on ""flash"" and the tool will do the rest. Thank you. After I flashed my Huawei c8812, it became stuck. What should I do? You should get it repaired. It's now a brick. You can try reinstalling the system, but it's difficult to do it yourself. How much does it cost to repair it? It's around 70 yuan (approximately $11).
What's the difference between the original package and the scattered chips of the CPU? There's no difference. One is packaged and the other is not. The scattered chips are more likely to be fake. Do all original package CPUs come with a heatsink? Is it enough to use? It depends on the specific CPU model and the requirements of its cooling. Generally, original package CPUs come with a suitable heatsink, but for high-performance CPUs, you may need to purchase a more powerful cooler. How about this configuration? I want to be able to play large single-player games and watch HD movies. This configuration should be sufficient for watching HD movies, but it may struggle with large single-player games at maximum settings. For the same price range, I suggest choosing a slightly stronger graphics card, such as the 7770 instead of the 650. Can you recommend a configuration for around 3000 RMB? Do you need a monitor? Yes, I do. This configuration should be able to handle HD movies and some games, but for high-performance gaming, you may need to invest more in a stronger graphics card and CPU. How about this configuration? I want to be able to play large single-player games and watch HD movies. This configuration should be able to handle HD movies without any issues, but for large single-player games with maximum settings, it may struggle. I hope my answers have been helpful to you. As long as it runs smoothly, it doesn't need any special effects.
I would like to ask a question. There is a newly renovated internet cafe nearby with all new equipment. I played Need for Speed 14 with all the special effects turned up to the maximum and there was no lag at all. What are the computer specifications and prices? Even the worst internet cafes have dedicated graphics cards, while some computers sold three years ago with integrated graphics cards cannot run Need for Speed smoothly. They cost around 3000 yuan and are not guaranteed to run the game smoothly. My computer, which cost 4500 yuan, can handle it without any problems.
Which one tastes better in the apartment, Bingrui or pre-mixed rum? Rio tastes better, but Bingrui looks better. Rio feels a bit stronger than Bingrui, but what about pre-mixed rum? It's okay. Which one tastes better between Bingrui and pre-mixed rum? The second one... which one? The rum.
I want to ask a question. There's a newly renovated internet cafe nearby with brand new equipment. I played Need for Speed 14 with all the special effects turned up to the highest settings, and it didn't lag at all. Could it be that the computer's configuration is different because of the storage capacity? What is the system storage capacity? Is it referring to a specific disk or something? Do you know about GB? If you don't, then you must be a fool. Is the difference in the size of the single-player game disk at the internet cafe 1024G? How can I download the Jiayuan dating app? If there's no client, can I only use the browser? "喔" in Chinese is an interjection that can be used in various contexts, but it generally expresses understanding, acknowledgment, or surprise. In English, it can be translated as "Oh," "I see," "Got it," or "Okay." The exact translation depends on the context in which it is used.
How can I download the "Zhi Ji Jiao You" app? Is it an app? I haven't used it before, is it easy to use? Can you introduce it, OP? I don't know if I can use it on my computer, can I also use it on my phone? I just don't know how to download it, so I can only log in through the website. There is no mobile client, right?
Where can I download 1080p high-definition movies? I don't want to use torrents for downloading, nor do I want to use Thunder (a download manager) because it's too slow. Even though it's faster with Thunder, I still have to become a VIP member to access the high-speed channel and offline downloading. I use an Android device, and the speed test shows that I have several hundred kilobytes per second, but Thunder downloads at only a few kilobytes per second. This is frustrating!
What's wrong with my computer monitor? It always goes black after being turned on for half a minute, but if I turn it off and on again, it's okay. However, after another half minute, it goes black again. I think it's not a problem with the display screen, but with the motherboard causing the black screen. Turning off and on the monitor's power can fix the problem, but it goes black again after a while. My friend's computer had the same problem a few days ago, and they solved it by replacing the screen with a new one. This method is effective. When replacing the screen, be sure to pay attention to the price and don't get ripped off.
What's wrong with my computer monitor? It keeps going black after being on for half a minute, and then it's fine again when I turn it off and on. But after half a minute, it goes black again. It's not the VGA interface of the main display that's aging. Which interface is it? How should I deal with it? I suggest you take it to a computer repair shop and have it looked at. It's quite troublesome to fix it. Even computer repair professionals may not know how to fix a monitor. Yeah, it's especially troublesome.
What's wrong with my computer monitor? It always goes black after half a minute of being turned on, but it's fine again after I turn it off and on. However, after half a minute, it goes black again. It's not because the cable behind your monitor is not plugged in properly, because it works fine before going black. I turn off the monitor's power and turn it on again to get the display back, but it goes black again after a while. If it's not a cable issue, then it could be a problem with your monitor's power cord. Try using the power cord from your rice cooker at home. My monitor is a TV-style display, so it could be either a cable issue or a problem with your plug.
What's wrong with my computer monitor that it keeps going black? It turns off after half a minute, and then I have to turn it off and on again to make it work. But after half a minute, it's back to the same problem again. Could it be a problem with the main transformer? When it goes black, I turn off the monitor and then turn it on again, and it works. But after a while, it goes black again. Is it a problem with the cable? Which cable are you referring to? The cable that connects the host to the monitor.
What's wrong with my computer monitor that it keeps turning black? (It turns black after being on for half a minute, then it's fine if I turn it off and on again. But after half a minute, it goes black again. Isn't the main monitor port connected properly? Everything was working fine until it suddenly turned black. I turn off the monitor power and turn it back on, and it works again, but after a while, it goes black again. I suggest you try changing the monitor power cord and using your rice cooker's cord to see if it works. Mine is a TV-style monitor, as long as the voltage is not a problem! I really don't know what's wrong with it.
Samsung S4 upgraded to 4.42. Why did it fail to root with 360 one-click root? Have you rooted your phone with 360 one-click root? You should connect your phone to a computer and use 360 one-click root on the computer. That's how I did it on my phone and it worked. I uninstalled a lot of pre-installed programs. You can give it a try. As for the failed root, well, then I'm not sure. Sorry I couldn't help you.
The Samsung S4 upgraded to 4.42. I tried to use 360 One-Click Root but it failed. Why? I'm going to download Baidu One-Click Root. Is Baidu's One-Click Root temporary? I need a temporary One-Click Root.
My company requires employees to buy a car in order to continue working. After buying a car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan for the car. If you don't buy a car, you will automatically resign. May I ask if there are any car brands that are less expensive than the BYD F0 and the Jiangnan TT, or maybe second-hand cars? Some second-hand Xia Li cars are only a few thousand yuan, let's see if you dare to drive them! The company requires us to buy a brand new car. As far as I know, the Jiangnan TT is the cheapest option, but it still costs 20,800 yuan, which is too expensive. I only have 20,000 yuan, and I also need to pay for license plates and get a driver's license. It's too difficult, and it's impossible for me to achieve it!
I tried to use 360 One-Click Root to root my Samsung S4 after upgrading to Android 4.4.2, but it failed. Why? Upgrading the Android system may make the phone slower, and rooting the phone may also make the system slower. Since you have already upgraded, it's best not to root it. Although it may be inconvenient to not have root access and it may consume more data, there are many self-starting apps. It's up to you. The S4 runs fast, so rooting may not cause too much lag. I understand, but sometimes when I include a header file like dos.h, VC shows an error message like "unnamed result."
On a network connection, how do I view the password? Is it on a phone or a computer? It's on a phone. Use "RE Manager" to open it.
Can everyone help me choose a laptop? HP's is okay, but the cooling is not very good. Are there any other options? Please provide more details. Many people around me use Lenovo.
What does the broadband network symbol display? Is it an exclamation mark? I only see "network limited" and can't access the internet on my phone. Can your computer access the internet? How many routers are connected to your broadband? If you can't connect with only one router, was it just installed today and not working, or did it stop working suddenly after a few days of use? I've been using it for a month and suddenly can't connect, and I didn't change any router settings.
"Can someone give me a QQ account? I don't know how to apply. What does '恩' mean?"
What's the difference between Crystal Members and Premium Members on Baihe.com? What services are good on Baihe.com? It's a scam website, only interested in making money. Why? Those high-end beautiful women who are active every day on the front lines are all fakes. Those who truly seek partners...can't bear to look more.
A Teddy dog is three months old and has dandruff and hair loss. How should it be treated? Based on your description, it should be a fungal skin disease. You can easily treat it by buying a spray for fungal skin disease. If you have any questions, you can ask me at any time, or add me on QQ. What is your QQ number?
The Teddy dog has dandruff and shedding for three months. How can I treat it? My dog had dandruff before and was very itchy and scratching all the time. We went to two pet hospitals. One said there was nothing wrong, and the other said it was severe and required a one-month injection. We checked the skin to see if there were any small red spots, which could be mites. We can use 886887 or carbaryl to soak in the bath. If there are no small red spots, then it is not caused by mites.
When the Seagate Backup Plus portable hard drive is connected to the computer, the computer cannot start up. It's a common problem for some portable storage devices. The computer may try to boot up directly from the portable storage device that you plugged in, but some computers won't do that. It's frustrating to have to unplug and plug in the hard drive every time you turn on or off the computer. Sometimes, even when the computer starts up, it still can't recognize the hard drive. You may need to change the hard drive mode to IDE or Compatibility mode in the BIOS settings, or use a partition software called DiskGenius that can be downloaded online to fix the issue. DiskGenius DiskMan in Tianyi can detect your hard drive, but it may not read the correct size. The 7.9GB size may be your Kingston USB drive. To fix it, you can change the hard drive mode to Compatibility or IDE in the BIOS, or install Windows 7 or use Win7 PE to see the hard drive. Also, when it comes to graphics cards, it's more important to look at the chip model rather than the video memory or bandwidth. Integrated graphics with a large video memory doesn't necessarily perform better than a high-end discrete graphics card. If you don't know, please don't make random comments. If you don't believe it, check where your integrated graphics card is positioned on the graphics card ladder chart. Why are you even considering video memory and bandwidth? Video memory is only relevant to resolution nowadays. Bandwidth is generally related to anti-aliasing. If you prefer to believe in JS's video memory theory, don't bother responding to me. Anyway, when evaluating a graphics card, I focus on the chip model and stream processors. Video memory and bandwidth are secondary considerations.
What is the fastest read and write speed for a hard drive? The average seek time for an SSD is 0.1 milliseconds, and for a 15000 RPM hard drive, it's about 5 milliseconds, while for a 10000 RPM hard drive, it's around 7 milliseconds. For desktops, we usually use 7200 RPM hard drives, and for laptops, we usually use 5400 RPM hard drives. The difference in read and write speed mainly depends on the seek time. Can you be more specific? Why is my FPS only 50 when playing CF? My CPU can't keep up. Before entering the game, lower the resolution, use 60HZ, decrease the contrast, and close unnecessary software. After entering the game, lower the bullet holes, weather effects, and other attributes. I was not experiencing any lag before these two days. I also went to a computer store, and they said my graphics card was fine. FPS is not solely determined by the graphics card. The CPU is the processor, and if the graphics card can keep up but the CPU can't, the game will still lag. Therefore, try the above solutions, and FPS should improve significantly. Also, playing AK with low FPS will affect your gameplay. Why is my FPS only 50 when playing CF? My internet speed isn't fast enough. I have the same problem, but as long as my internet speed is good enough, I can get 100 FPS. My internet speed is 6 Mbps and the ping is 12, so it's not possible that the issue is caused by my internet speed.
My child is almost 4 years old and is taken care of by my grandmother in the countryside. When we were at the market, my child hid by the roadside and was hit by a car. The other party did not have compulsory insurance. May I ask who is responsible for the accident? The teacher is fully responsible because you should have been more careful when taking care of your child by the roadside. Thank you. You're welcome. It's my pleasure to help.
My Samsung Galaxy S3 unlocks with my password, but then it automatically locks again and repeats this process. I've tried turning it off and removing the battery, but it still happens. Have you tried flashing the firmware? It might be a software issue. Try doing a factory reset. You can search for how to do it on Baidu, and it should unlock your phone. So, do I need to flash the firmware? No, you don't need to flash it. A factory reset should work. You can search for how to do a factory reset on Baidu. You're welcome.
How to make this kind of picture? Is there a title? I forgot, anyway, go to the website and have a look for yourself. I saw it a long time ago, my memory is not good.
A song sung by a male and female, with the male mostly rapping. One line of lyrics is "I have half, you have half", looking for kind-hearted people, Xiao Xue vs. Han Yang... "Actually I Mind" No, the male in the Mandarin version is also rapping.
I am considering studying computer science as a graduate student, but my programming ability is not good. It doesn't matter which direction I choose because I will follow my supervisor's lead and work on whatever project they take on. Of course, some teachers do not take on many projects, so I won't have much to do if that's the case. No one has good programming ability naturally; it is improved by working on projects. Hey, but I saw information on information security and networks in the admission brochure, shouldn't I apply for those first? During my undergraduate years, I only worked on basic management software and similar projects. By the way, which school are you from? Let's exchange some ideas, hehe. I sent you a private message; I don't know if you received it.
Where can I download the most original and free Microsoft Office Word 2003? I cannot provide a website, but you can search for "msdn itell you." However, the original version means a paid version. What I mean is not necessarily the original version, but just Word 2003 is okay. So I need a free version, like the one on school computers. The ones I downloaded myself prompt that they cannot be installed.
What is the meaning of this code? Set the background color of this div to #A1EAFF. Is this jQuery? And is the ID referring to a JSP page? This is jQuery. The ID refers to an ID defined in HTML. For example, setting the background color of this div to #A1EAFF, ""videoinfo"" is an ID.
Free mobile hard drive data recovery software. I'll send you a cracked super hard drive data recovery software, SuperRecovery. But if it's physically damaged, I estimate that no software will be effective, and you may need to hire a specialized data recovery company. If it's accidentally deleted, accidentally formatted, or something similar, and nothing has been written to the disk after deletion, then this software can still help you recover your data. If you insist on saying that, I can't do anything about it. I'll add you as a friend, but I don't know if you'll let me through. Haha, I've sent it. How does it feel to use? It's currently scanning, and it will take four hours! Hehe... Sorry about that. I'm really grateful that my data has been recovered.
How about this computer configuration? Experts, please advise what wattage the power supply should be. Generally speaking, the graphics card is dragging behind. If you want to play the latest large-scale 3D games, it is recommended to start with at least 8GB of memory and a 1080P display. Your current configuration should be fine with a 450W power supply rating. As for which graphics card to replace with, it depends on personal preference. The computer has not been assembled yet! Thank you, master! For a GTX 760 or 660ti, pay attention to the power supply. The price may increase by around 300 yuan!
What's the configuration of this computer? Is it fast? I want to buy it urgently. Seeking advice from experts. If the price is not too expensive, I suggest not using the WIN8 system. The mid-to-high-end configuration should be fine for gaming, but Lenovo's system needs to be reinstalled. I want to play games. How about the 4699 barebone computer? What games are you planning to play? This machine may experience some lag while playing League of Legends, but it shouldn't be a big problem. What about CrossFire?
How's the configuration of this computer? Is it fast? I want to buy it. Seeking expert advice. It's very powerful. How about playing games on it? This computer...I think it's good enough. The application memory is large, and the processor is also very powerful. I'm taking a picture, can you take a look for me? Sure. The configuration is good enough. Can it handle large games? Can it run the CF game? Can't use it up. I just bought a wireless network extender! But I don't know how to use it! Download the driver online! Then it will be okay. Is it a wireless network card driver? Yes, that's right!
In mid-February of 2014, there was a traffic accident (a Changan Star rubbed against a Lexus, and no one was hurt, but the car's paint was scratched). The traffic police ruled that Zhou was at fault and he was given basic rest days on Saturday and Sunday, which totaled eight or nine days. I have checked my account, but it has been a month now and the compensation has not been received yet. When I call, they only say that it will be delivered as soon as possible.
How to add a hard drive to the IBM x3650 server? The prerequisite is that you are familiar with ServeRAID Manager or can enter the RAID configuration interface (Ctrl+A) when the machine starts up. For this model of machine, the hard drive must be configured by the RAID card before it can be recognized by the operating system. Therefore, the newly added hard drive must be an Array or a Simple Volume. The newly added disk cannot be added to an existing Array and can only generate a new Array or Simple Volume. So you need to use ServeRAID Manager or enter the RAID card by pressing Ctrl+A during startup to create a new Array or Simple Volume. After that, use the "rescan disk" option in the operating system's disk management to discover the hard drive, partition, format, assign a drive letter, and then it can be used. The machine model number is MT: 7979 and you cannot simply open the box and connect a hard drive. There are six 3.5-inch or 2.5-inch drive bays and a DDS4 tape drive at the front of the machine. Remove the bays that are not installed with hard drives, insert the new hard drive, and no data cables need to be connected.
The best art class for the college entrance examination in Shanghai, it would be great to go to Beijing. I am from Shanghai and currently in my second year of junior high school. Are you in your second year of junior high school or senior high school? Why are you thinking about it so early? If you wait until senior high school to start learning, it will be too late. Should we go to Beijing to study then? I want to study in Shanghai, but I still have to finish my studies.
Apart from using ASSSD for testing, what other methods can be used to check the 4K alignment of a solid-state drive? The optimization master has it, and I used that for alignment. I couldn't find the option in the optimization master. Can you tell me how to select it specifically?
Remote monitoring setup for Dahua DVR. I use it for my company. First, I need to turn on the network function of the Dahua DVR and test it within the LAN to see if it can be accessed. Then, I need to set up the DMZ host in the router and fill in the DVR's internal IP address. Finally, I need to turn on the domain name function of the router. TP's router has this function (Peanut Shell). If not, try updating the router firmware on the TP website. Our company did not originally have this function, but we updated it later. Of course, we still need to apply for our own domain name. If the LAN is accessible, I followed your instructions and applied for a domain name. But I don't know what to input when accessing it from outside the LAN. Have you bound the domain name with the DMZ host (i.e., the internal IP address of your DVR) in the router? If it's done, you can directly access your DVR using the domain name from outside the LAN. I have completed all the settings, but I can't access the webpage by entering the URL at home. Is this the correct way? My Peanut Shell domain name is the URL. When using my phone, there are sudden stripes and then a black screen. The stripes have appeared in various colors. The screen is either broken or loose inside. Diagnosis complete. Is it not a problem with the ribbon cable?
Does anyone have the touchpad driver for HP G4-2136TX with Win7 32-bit system, the kind that can lock the touchpad by pressing the groove? The computer should have come with a driver disc for you, right? No, I replaced the system myself and don't have it anymore. You can try to find the driver on the HP official website.
What is the approximate price for a second-hand laptop like this? It can probably sell for around 3000. I've been using it for two years, it's already out of warranty, but the appearance is relatively new, and the machine has an aluminum alloy shell. Can it be sold for 3500? Maybe it can only sell for 3000.

The Shanghai Bell RG2210-CA fiber optic modem of China Telecom, I want to find the administrator password so that I can set the modem to dial automatically. The home wifi router network is unstable, I used to think it was a problem with the router, so I bought a new one, but the network is still unstable. You should contact the service provider to completely solve the problem, as this involves the network cable of your router and the server responsible for your area. I contacted the service provider, but they said that as long as I can access the Internet, it is not within their jurisdiction, and told me to contact the router seller. I have tried several routers, but the problem persists. You should check if your computer or router has set any scheduled tasks. I haven't set any scheduled tasks. Has anyone else made any changes? No. I just called the service provider at 10000, and they said my network is normal.
The wifi router network at home is unstable. I used to think it was a problem with the router, so I bought a new one, but the network is still unstable. It's possible that there is a problem with your line. You should call the service provider to upgrade to fiber broadband. When it was set up, it seemed like nothing needed to be entered and you could connect to the internet directly. Upgraded to fiber? Enter the router interface setup wizard, select static IP, and enter the IP provided by the service provider and other information. They didn't provide me with any of this information. Alright then, I'm off.
I want to change my graphics card and I'm looking for recommendations!!! Experts, please take a look at my computer's specs, my current graphics card is really bad. Especially looking for high-performance-to-price ratio CPU products. I suggest adding 4G of memory. I recommend the 660 and 7850 graphics cards, which have a good price-performance ratio. The 660 has about 15% higher performance than the 7850, but it is $200 more expensive. They are both compatible with my current setup and can handle mainstream games easily. The Sapphire HD7850 1G GDDR5 Platinum Edition is priced at ￥1099, and the Inno3D GTX660 Ice Dragon Edition is priced at ￥1299. Do you need to change anything else? No, there is no need to change anything else as it won't significantly improve the performance. If you feel that the loading speed of games or software is slow, you can consider adding a solid-state hard drive. Of course, your power supply should be rated at least 400W, otherwise, it can easily cause various errors, instability, and affect the hardware lifespan.
The Wi-Fi router network at home is unstable. Previously, I thought it was a problem with the router, so I bought a new one, but the network is still unstable. Could someone be using our network without permission? It's unlikely because the password is quite complex. It might be an issue with the Ethernet cable or the internet service provider.
Begging for a master in antivirus software. Nowadays, many antivirus software automatically push virus library updates, such as NOD32, Kaspersky, etc. Just set it to update automatically. Master: What I mean is that the banking industry uses a LAN, and my idea is to push updates directly to each terminal through the server-side without requiring terminal personnel to operate. This saves a lot of manpower and material resources, and there is no feasible way without client-side operations. Please take a look at my computer configuration and recommend an upgrade around 1000 yuan. Upgrading the CPU on the original motherboard may not bring a qualitative leap. I am considering: 1. Upgrading to an I5 3470 + 250 yuan H61 motherboard for a total of 1300 yuan, and then upgrading to a better graphics card to achieve a mid-to-high-end configuration. 2. Upgrading to an I3 3240 + B75 motherboard for a total of 1000 yuan, and then upgrading the graphics card later. Will simply changing the graphics card have no effect? If you want to change the motherboard, isn't it better to just buy a new computer? How to repair disk recovery sectors? If you only need to repair disk recovery sectors, you can use the system's built-in disk tool to repair it. If that doesn't work, you can use partition software to organize the disk partition. If you need to retrieve data, you need to use a data recovery software such as "DataExplore Data Recovery" or "Data Recovery Master" to recover the data first, and then perform disk processing.
Seeking guidance from all the experts, what are the problems with network marketing research? What are the corresponding strategies for Jumei.com? I have done research on network marketing and Jumei.com, and I can help you. So, what are the problems with Jumei.com? What are the solutions to these problems? Last year someone told me on Tieba that it was from the Tang Dynasty, and this year someone told me it was probably from the Han-Jin period. Can an expert give me an estimate and a rough price? Isn't there a program on CCTV that specializes in this? It's so troublesome. Nowadays, all the programs are just for show! I mainly want to get an idea first, so I have some knowledge. I don't quite understand. My family doesn't have antiques, so I'm not very familiar with this kind of thing. You can try calling 114 to see if there is a hotline for experts in this field.
My laptop has a Windows 8 operating system with one partition. Please teach me how to divide it into four and install a Windows 7 operating system using a system disk. It's too much to type out, so add me on QQ and I'll teach you step by step. Do I have to charge you for it? I'm confused, I'll teach you for free.
What is being sold on JD.com, Swarovski, is it really priced at just over 700 yuan? Can we trust buying from JD.com? Swarovski's products are all made of valuable crystal glass and are designed and crafted by designers. Remember, all Swarovski products are made of glass. I want to buy a birthday gift for my sister for under 1000 yuan. Do you have any good recommendations, such as necklaces, bracelets, pendants, and so on?
Is it true that Swarovski sold on JD.com is only a little over 700 yuan? Can I trust buying it on JD.com? Swarovski is just a stone, so on JD.com, it can only be said that it is more authentic than on another platform. I want to buy a birthday gift for my sister for under 1000 yuan. Do you have any good recommendations for necklaces, bracelets, pendants, and the like? Gold prices have dropped now. You can buy a gold pendant or something like that by going to the mall. It's high-end and classy. Even with the price drop, it's still not exactly cheap...
Did the disk create an extra partition? How do I merge it? What tool should I use? I have been using Acronis Disk Director Suite, a non-destructive partitioning tool for 34 years. I have helped my friends partition XP, Vista, and Win7, and it also has a merge function for non-destructive partitioning. I used to use Partition Magic, but I switched to Acronis Disk Director Suite because it is better. Is this Chinese difficult to learn? I want to evenly merge the extra partition with the other four partitions. I used to use English, but I now use the Chinese version because it has a graphical interface, and you can perform the operation first and then apply it. You need to restart the computer, and be careful not to power it off during the process, or you may lose data. It is no problem to evenly distribute the extra partition to the other partitions, you just need to divide it by yourself. For example, if you have 10G, you can divide it into 2.5G for each partition. The graphical interface is very clear and easy to understand. I personally recommend that you first install a virtual machine, practice partitioning on it, and then operate on the real machine. Safety comes first. Download and try it out first.
The opening speed of Office Excel is slow. It's slow to open large files. Haha, if it works well on another computer, it means that the computer's software has Office compatibility. The main thing to check is the antivirus software. Some antivirus software may have different compatibility with Office, haha. Currently, everyone's computer seems to have this problem, so it shouldn't be a hardware issue. Or, I feel that the long opening time may be related to the Print Spooler service, but I'm not sure how to configure it. I tried using WPS and it opened much faster. However, the tables themselves are quite complicated and the compatibility between WPS and Office is not perfect. After editing in WPS and transferring back to Office, there may be formatting errors that need to be fixed. If possible, adding an SSD solid-state drive can greatly improve the overall speed of the computer.
The speed of opening office EXCEL is slow, so I'm considering either reinstalling the system or using a smaller system since the software has been reinstalled. The hard disk is an SSD, so the speed should be sufficient. I don't understand why disabling the Print Spooler solves the problem. How can I solve the issue of being unable to access local disk E? I tried changing permissions with a superuser account, but even after changing the permissions with my administrator account, the problem persists. It has been resolved now, so I will give you some points.
Hello, if I lose my Xiaomi phone or want to switch to another brand of phone, how can I transfer the phone numbers synchronized with my Xiaomi account to my new phone? Do I need to download Xiaomi Phone Assistant? Can Xiaomi Phone Assistant be installed on other Android systems?
I want to know what face shape I have? What kind of hairstyle should I keep? Can someone tell me? Thank you. And if my face shape belongs to the long face type, I suggest keeping a full fringe with curly or straight hair. Is that so?
What technology in Java, jQuery or JavaScript can achieve this function? I would be grateful. On the right-hand side, there is a list of search results. How can I select a name from the list and fill it into that box by clicking a button? Both the left and right sides are iframes. Okay, can anyone tell me a few good websites to watch mobile phone videos online? Thank you. I couldn't access 84dddd.com, and it showed me 731 instead. I searched for it on QQ browser.
When the router disconnects from the internet, unplug the network cable from the router, plug it directly into the computer, and test the connection. If it works, the problem is with the router. Cut off the power to the router, reconnect the power and restart the network, and the problem should be fixed. The router often disconnects from the internet due to quality issues, but generally it is stable. My router is several years old and has only disconnected once. I use a "Swift" wireless router for home use, which costs 90 yuan. Try my method and hopefully it will be helpful. I have also experienced this issue in the past few days, so you should test it first by directly dialing without the router. If it doesn't work, it's an issue with the service provider, not the router. You won't know until you try it.
The router has lost its internet connection. Access the router interface, go to "Network Parameters," then "WAN Port Settings," and choose "Automatic Connection," then click "Save." It should always be set to automatic connection. The screenshot you showed indicates on-demand connection, which refreshes every 5 seconds. If you didn't send the wrong screenshot, follow the steps I've given you: Network Parameters > WAN Port Settings > MAC Address Cloning > Clone MAC Address > WAN Port Settings > Choose "Automatic Connection" > Click "Save."
Router disconnected from the internet. I went into the router interface to reset it, but even after restoring the router to its factory settings and resetting it, it still didn't work.
How do I get rid of the string of English that pops up when I create a 3D Max animation? Please tell me if you know, it's urgent. My computer has enough memory, so 3D Max should be automatically closing. If it's not automatically closing, what should I do?
I withdrew 1200 yuan from the Bank of Communications today. When do I need to repay the credit card cash advance? Your credit card has billing and repayment dates, and they are all different. As long as you repay before the due date, it's okay! Hope you can adopt this suggestion! Yes, you can withdraw cash with your credit card. I don't know the exact date. Please call customer service to avoid missing the repayment date!
What's wrong with my computer that it can't connect to the router? It doesn't work when it gets to the step of automatically obtaining an IP address. It just can't automatically obtain it. The system is W7. Are you sure you didn't plug in the wrong cable? Maybe you switched the cable for the modem and the router. Let me try swapping them out. Thank you. Let me explain it to you. You don't need to plug in the modem cable, just connect to the router, and make sure the router is turned on. Then it should be able to automatically obtain the IP address. Follow the instructions, plug in the cables correctly, and restore the router to its factory settings to solve the problem. Remember, you must plug in the cables correctly.
What's wrong with my computer that it can't connect to the router? It fails to automatically obtain an IP address. It always fails to automatically obtain it. The system is W7. Check if other devices, such as a phone, can detect and use the router. If there are no other devices, restart the router. That means unplugging and plugging in the router's power and then trying again. (This situation is more common.) The phone can detect it, but it can't be used normally. Then, try restarting the router. Also, does your router have an internet connection? In other words, have you set up an internet account? It seems like I haven't. How do you connect to the internet then? If it's a newly purchased router, you can't connect to the internet without setting up a dial-up connection in the router. Okay, thank you. I'll try it out. If I don't understand anything, I'll ask you again. Sure, if you don't know how to set it up, you can refer to the manual or call customer service. Don't worry too much. Once you do it once, you'll understand how to do it.
What's wrong with my computer that it can't connect to the router? It doesn't work after reaching the step of automatically obtaining the IP address... It always fails to obtain it automatically... The system is W7. First, try to plug the network cable from the modem into the computer and dial up. After connecting, the computer still cannot access the internet... Have you dialed up on the computer?
What's wrong with my computer that it can't connect to the router? It doesn't work at the step of automatically obtaining the IP address. It always fails to obtain it automatically. The system is W7. I'll try changing the password or maybe reconnecting the router's cable. Could it be that the router is broken? It doesn't work even when I bring it to a friend's place. Please check the instructions on the router first, and see if the cables are plugged in correctly. Okay, I'll take a look and try. If it still doesn't work, I'll ask for your help again. Thank you. You're welcome, it's my pleasure to help.
I want to know what my face shape is and what kind of hairstyle I should keep. Can someone tell me? Thank you. I feel like I look pretty good now with a center part and big curls, but I'm not sure if a center part would make me look too mature. I think you would look better with a center part.
What's wrong with my computer that it can't connect to the router? It can't automatically obtain an IP address after reaching that step. It always fails to do so. The system is W7 and I've selected the second connection method.
Why is the WiFi connected but not working? Other people can use it, and there's no limit on the number of users. Try turning off your device and turning it back on again. I've tried that, but I still can't figure it out. Well, then just wait for a bit. There are too many people, so it's a matter of who gets a better connection. It's the same for everyone. If you're still having trouble, you should ask the mobile company. Oh, I see.
Just opened an online store for a month, do you have any records of transactions? Usually, when an online store has just opened, they would ask their acquaintances to purchase items and give positive reviews, or sell virtual products like Q coins to increase popularity. Do you have an answer? What I mean is, as long as people are not foolish, there will definitely be transaction records.
Urgently seeking a registration code for Corel VideoStudio Pro X6. X6 serial number: VS16R06-FPU4YDA-WNGZGVS-MZ2Y3FC (use your own if you have one). Enter the serial number and call Corel. (P) 3. Copy the installation code (5 sets in total) and post it here for further inquiry (screenshots are recommended as mistakes can be made and it takes time). I will help calculate the activation code.
I have lost an important document, what should I do? It seems that there is not just one file... I don't even know how to install the system. It's so troublesome. Those data files are all very important.
The newly bought hard drive is a Seagate hard drive that spins at 37200 rpm with a SATA interface. How should it be connected? "6G/S" indicates SATA3 interface, "3G/S" indicates SATA2 interface. To use the IDE interface (which is no longer available on most new motherboards) and RAID (matrix), just leave it at the default settings. The motherboard comes with two black 6G/s data cables, one L-shaped and one straight, and the hard drive also comes with a red cable. Which cable should be used?
How to perform a low-level format on a hard drive in DOS? Many motherboards now have built-in low-level formatting programs. Use the DOS 6 boot system to run DM to perform a low-level format on the hard drive. Start the computer with a CD and select the DOS toolbox from the CD menu to use DM to low-level format the hard drive. A friendly reminder: if you want to completely remove viruses, you only need to delete all partitions and re-partition the drive. Thank you for reminding me that my hard drive has bad sectors. I heard that low-level formatting can hide bad sectors, but I don't know how to do it. Low-level formatting can only solve logical bad sectors and cannot solve physical bad sectors. In fact, for logical bad sectors, as long as you delete all partitions and re-partition the drive, it can also be solved (if there are not many bad sectors). I made a mistake earlier. Nowadays, there are few motherboards with low-level formatting programs, but the DOS toolbox is included in the current GHOST CD.
May I ask how to remove the default network facilities in Win7 and set Wireless Network Connection 2 to prohibit user sharing? How can I set it up?
Why does upgrading the system require a wireless network? How can I set up a cellular system on my iPhone with only 200MB? It's okay to use cellular data without Wi-Fi, but I cannot download anything without Wi-Fi. I think I will update it using my computer instead. I have one monitor and two computers, how can I control both of them with just one monitor? It's for home use and I have internet, what should I do? You can buy a video splitter that can connect to many computers. Haha. How can I do it remotely with remote desktop?
Are there any families with twins? My two twin daughters are just over two weeks old. They often fight over things and the clothes and toys I buy for them are all the same. Now that the children are still young, I want to encourage my two daughters to be more united. When they grow up, they'll end up like enemies. In fact, there is a solution to this. At night, I call out the youngest one and tell her to listen to her older sister. I tell the older sister to protect her and take care of her younger sister. They should listen to each other. Children are easy to deal with, but as a mother, I need to be patient and keep trying. This method hasn't been effective for me, though. I repeat it every day and they agree, but when it comes to fighting, they forget all about it.
"I want to know what my face shape is and what hairstyle suits me. Can someone please tell me? Thank you." "This looks very pretty. Haha, really? But I don't like it this way." "Very good."
Are there any families with twins? My two twin daughters are just over two weeks old, and they often fight over things. The clothes and toys that I buy for them are actually the same, but let me tell you a method: for example, when you buy a toy for your child, don't give it to them directly. Instead, let each of them complete a task that is not too easy for them, but not too difficult either. The child who finishes first can choose the toy, but they must help their sister complete her task before they can get the toy. Sigh! Being a parent is not easy.
Are there any families with twins? My two twin daughters are just over two weeks old and often fight over things. The clothes and toys I buy for them are all for these two kids. Their personalities don't complement each other. Yes, they are both very stubborn. Should I take them to early education classes? This is a critical period for personality formation, so I need to teach them well. My daughter just turned one year old, and her temper is also bad. Why are kids so difficult to manage nowadays?
What does this come from? Oh my, it's very serious. It's a skin allergy. Hurry up and see a doctor. Isn't this just acne? Oh no, this is eczema.
"I want to know what face shape I have? What hairstyle should I keep? Can someone tell me, thank you." "Can you make me a bob hairstyle? What is a bob hairstyle?"

What's wrong when a Jetta car stalls when stepping on the gas pedal? Is it manual or automatic? Are you sure you have a good grasp of the clutch? It's manual. When in neutral and stepping on the gas, the car stalls. We have checked the fuel injection and ignition, and they are fine. Who told you to step on the gas in neutral? Which instructor? Cut him off. Shift into gear and step on the gas immediately, isn't stepping on the gas in neutral pointless?
My daughter was born on December 6th, 2003, around 2 o'clock. Other people suggested that I should change her name. Her original name was Liu Qiyuan, which means "a sheep" in Chinese. I'm not sure if it's a male or female name. Her new name is Liu Runlin.
My company requires employees to purchase a car in order to continue working. After buying a car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan for car expenses. If you do not buy a car, you will automatically resign. May I ask if there are any car brands that qualify? Can I get the same subsidy if I buy a bicycle? Please don't look down on people.
My company requires employees to buy a car in order to continue working. After purchasing the car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan for the car expenses. If you do not buy a car, you will automatically resign. May I ask what brand of car you want to buy? A used QQ car is the cheapest, but it is too expensive. Moreover, the company requires us to buy a new car. What price range are you looking for? A little over 10,000 yuan plus the cost of registration is less than 20,000 yuan. I think buying an electric car for a little over 10,000 yuan without registration is a good option.
My company requires employees to buy a car to continue working. After purchasing a car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan. If you do not buy a car, you will automatically be dismissed. May I ask if there are any car brands that are not as expensive as the BYD F0 or Alto? What kind of company is this? It's too unreasonable. Can't we buy a van or even an elderly mobility scooter that runs on gasoline and doesn't require a license plate? An elderly mobility scooter? Well, there should be places that sell motorcycles. A few thousand yuan, not exceeding ten thousand.
My company requires employees to buy a car in order to continue working. After purchasing a car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan. If you don't buy a car, you will automatically resign. Can you recommend any car brands or companies? Sorry, I have no choice but to ask for your help in thinking of something.

If you don't buy a car, you will automatically resign. May I ask if there are any specific brands of cars that are required? Or can a used car like a Shali be purchased, or does it need to be brand new?
My company requires employees to buy a car in order to continue working. After buying a car, the company will provide a subsidy of 88 yuan for the car. If you do not buy a car, you will automatically resign. May I ask if there are any car brands that are too expensive? My budget is just over 10,000 yuan, including the cost of the license plate. The cheapest option would be preferred. If new cars are too expensive, I can consider buying a used car for under 10,000 yuan.
"I'm 16 years old now, but there are spots on my face. Is there any way to remove them?" "Is there any trick to remove the spots? Should I eat more fruits during puberty?" "First of all, don't use whitening cosmetics to remove the spots. Instead, use traditional Chinese medicine instead of medication." "Can anyone tell me how to make Didi drivers accept orders faster and add money? I'm a driver."
"Excuse me, is the annual assessment for the C1 vocational qualification certificate required every year? For the operating license, do we need the vocational qualification certificate? Can I withdraw my housing provident fund? If so, how much can I withdraw?" "For the C1 vocational qualification certificate, it is required to be assessed annually. As for the operating license, it is required to have the vocational qualification certificate. To know if you can withdraw your housing provident fund and how much you can withdraw, you can consult the labor bureau."
I would like to buy a car with a price range below 1 million. Can you guys help me decide what car to buy? Which one is better between Audi A8, Jaguar XJ, and Q7? If I want a more powerful car, I could buy a Toyota Land Cruiser or a Lincoln Navigator that looks like an armored vehicle. How about a Mercedes-Benz G65? Anyway, they are all pretty good. Thank you. What about a Bugatti?
I lost my ID card, how can I get a boarding pass? Can you please provide a detailed explanation? Thank you. Do you have your driver's license, passport, or household registration? As long as it matches your ID card. Can I get a boarding pass with my driver's license? It seems like I can't. You should be able to. You can use it to take high-speed rail and regular trains. I haven't tried it for a flight, but you can ask the staff at the station. They should have a public security window where you can apply for a temporary ID card.
I would like to buy a car with a price range of below one million. Can anyone suggest what kind of car is good? How much does the Mercedes ML350 cost, and is it a good choice to drive without spending one million? Is it easy to drive, and how is its performance and configuration? Also, what about the BMW X5? Thank you. Which one is better, the Touareg or the ML350? How can a Volkswagen be compared to a Mercedes? However, many comments say that the Touareg is good. The 350 model sells better and has a higher cost performance, but is the Range Rover also a good choice? The fuel consumption of the Range Rover is similar to that of the Hummer. What do you think? I'm asking you because I don't know. Actually, I think the Land Rover Evoque is pretty good and looks very nice. Is the Range Rover not good?
I want to buy a car that costs less than 1 million yuan. What kind of car should I buy? Can you help me decide, friends? Should I buy a sedan or an SUV? For a car under 1 million yuan, I'm considering a sedan, such as a Jaguar XJL or a Mercedes-Benz S350, or an SUV like the Land Rover Discovery 3.0t. Can you help me find a pair of shoes that are the same as these? Do you know the name of the shoes? If you do, please let me know. I added some additional information: my QQ number is 1298281692. What can I add to make the latex paint stronger in terms of coverage? The best option is to add tinting color, but generally, colored paints have good coverage. The adhesion strength depends on the brand. I want a white paint with good coverage.
Which brand of milk is good? Is Tetra Pak good? What about Shuhua milk? I haven't tried it before! Have you tried it? It's okay. What about Tetra Pak? I haven't tried it.

My surname is Shang. I would like to ask all netizens to give a meaningful and easy-to-pronounce name for my daughter. I am in a hurry, thank you. Shang Yiyi! Shang Yao... this name is already taken by someone I know. Uh...do you have any other suggestions? Shang Tong... Shang Qi... Sorry, those are also taken. Naming is really a headache.
My surname is "Shang". I would like to ask all netizens to suggest a meaningful and pleasant name for my daughter. I am in a hurry, thank you. The names I have considered are "Shang Lingxi", "Shang Zimei" and "Shang Yeming". Thank you, beautiful lady, but none of them are the name I have chosen. As a high school student, I can't think of any good names, haha. It's okay, but if you come across or hear any nice names recently, please send them to me. Thank you.

Two people fell into a trap and died. What do you call the person who can bring the dead back to life? This is a brain teaser. Of course, the answer is "help". Now, if two people fell into a trap and one died while the other survived, what do you call the survivor? The answer is not "rescuer" or "living person". I'm not sure what the answer is.
Which brand of milk is good? Is Tetra Pak good? What about Shuhua milk? I haven't tried it before! Have you tried it? It's okay. What about Tetra Pak? I haven't tried it.
I posted a message saying that my waist was uncomfortable, and that girl left a lot of negative comments. Damn it, I'm innocent. I'm planning to pursue her. Is there any hope? What does she mean? Haha, there is hope! She even commented actively! As a girl, her mentality is usually to test you and see how you respond. If you admit it, she will definitely be disappointed! Really? Absolutely and definitely! If she doesn't have feelings for you, why would she leave a comment? It's just to find a topic to talk about. Before falling in love, teasing and ambiguity is common.
I am currently 180 pounds and am trying to lose weight, but I have a sweet tooth and want to eat braised pork and instant noodles. Especially at night, when I wake up, I want to eat meat. If I am not hungry, should I drink water and eat fruit? I only want to eat meat, and if I eat fruit, I feel nauseous. Losing weight is a difficult task, and I must have the determination to succeed! Keep it up! Okay, thank you.
I posted a status update saying that my back was hurting, and that woman left a lot of negative comments. Damn, I'm innocent here. I'm planning to pursue her, is there any hope? What does she mean? She was just joking with you. At least this shows that you are closer and easier to get along with in her eyes. Go for it, there is a chance of success~ I have already made an appointment with her. How should I pursue her?
I posted a message saying that my back is not comfortable. That woman left many negative comments. Damn it, I am innocent. I am thinking about pursuing her. Is there any hope? What does she mean? Obviously, I am just kidding. Oh, I am just kidding. Nowadays, there are few conservative women.
I posted a message saying my waist is uncomfortable, and that woman left many negative comments. Damn it, I'm innocent! I'm planning to pursue her, is there any hope? What does she mean? Definitely have a chance, keep going and I wish you happiness! We've known each other for two months, how should I pursue her? Have you confessed your feelings to her? No, I haven't. She asked me to help her take care of her dog some time ago. Is she single? Yes, she is. She broke up with her ex a month ago. Invite her out and confess your feelings in person, not over the phone or through messages. Is the success rate high? If you're worried about not being able to catch up, it's not good for your friendship either. Yes, face is also important. I don't like to be too pushy, at most two attempts, then I'll disappear. If you like her, be bold and speak up. It's better to regret what you have done than what you haven't. There are several guys pursuing her, and she says she values her feelings a lot. She told me she likes bad boys, but not too much. "Bad" can have many meanings. What does she mean? Actually, it's the kind of daring and fearless person who can protect her and make her feel safe. She just broke up, so don't rush to pursue her. You can tell her that you like her and have been paying attention to her for a long time, but you heard that she just broke up, so it's not appropriate to confess now. However, you always think of her and would like her to consider it seriously. It mainly depends on how she is recovering now. Recovering? She is still in the grieving stage. It depends on the person. Some people really need comfort and care in this situation. What about the tomboy type of girl? Her boyfriend is in jail.
I posted a message saying that my waist is uncomfortable. That girl left a lot of negative comments. Damn, I'm being wronged. I'm thinking of pursuing her. Is there any hope? What does she mean? She was saying that you have a lot of sexual activity in bed, don't you understand? I haven't done anything. What can I do if she thinks that way?
May I ask how to get from Seoul Station to Incheon Airport as fast as possible? Thank you! Also, is there a direct express line available? If not, should I take the subway? Could you provide more details?
What is website hosting for computer experts? Does every website have hosting? How do I upload files using FTP? Can you explain in detail? Every website has its own hosting space. If it's an enterprise website, after purchasing hosting space, the service provider will give you a management account, an address, and login credentials. Once you log in, you can see details about the hosting space. You can call your hosting provider to get management permissions and access to the space. Oh, your website was created on the website builder platform called ""Fanka"" and it's free. Some websites have hosting included.
I would like to ask if there is a cracked version of the game "TianTian FeiChe" or not. There isn't. If you don't have money to play, I recommend downloading an app that helps you earn money called "ShengQian ZhuShou". "Why use that?" you may ask. That's my first response.
How to do it specifically? Is there a conflict between the external interrupt and the timer of the microcontroller? Can you help me take a look at the program? There is a chance that the external interrupt will cause the timer to stop working or no longer interrupt. Firstly, your Timer 1 is in mode 0 (13-bit counter), and unless you use a very low frequency external crystal, the timing time of Timer 1 is not at the second level at all. Secondly, you have not posted the location where the time run flag is modified. If you suspect that Timer 1 is not working continuously, you can temporarily remove the if (time run == 1) condition and observe whether the digital tube displays the changing value every time. By the way, the statement in your Timer0 interrupt is inefficient, and this is not a healthy interrupt service function. The interrupt service function should strive to be concise and clear. Secondly, I once tried to remove time run, but the problem that occurred was the same. Thirdly, I tried to move the contents of Timer0 to another function, and then added a=1 in Timer0. In the main function, I added if (a==1) {run the function mentioned earlier here}. The first line of the function wrote a=0, trying to slim down the interrupt service program, but the program didn't work. As for the infrared remote control part, because of time constraints, I excerpted information, so I am not very familiar with it.
What antivirus software do computers use nowadays? Is 360 Total Security good to use? Of course, we use 360 Total Security on these several laptops.
Computer Configuration: There is absolutely no problem playing GTA4 with this configuration. If you experience low FPS, then there might be some issues with the hardware or drivers. The E5500 CPU is a dual-core processor with 2 threads, and 4GB of RAM with a GTS450 graphics card. There should be no problem playing large-scale games with this setup. The game itself doesn't eat up too much CPU, but instead relies heavily on the graphics card, memory, and hard drive. Based on some reviews, GTA4 primarily relies on CPU and memory. As for the GTS450 graphics card, I suggest buying a Galax one. From what I know, this graphics card was produced around 2011 and has been discontinued. Most of the cards available in the market are refurbished. Given this, will GTA4 run smoothly on medium to high settings with this setup? Or will it run perfectly?
I am currently 180 jin and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. Especially at night, I wake up wanting to eat meat. I think I cannot just rely on dieting to lose weight. The key is to exercise more and have a reasonable diet. Walking is already tiring for me, not to mention exercising, which could be fatal. Thank you anyway.
Computer configuration: For the graphics card, let's go with the GTS450 from Yingchi, which costs around 400-460 yuan on Taobao. I recommend the GTX 650, which costs only a little over 600 yuan. Can you recommend a song? I searched for "Zhen Ai Zhi Dao" on QQ Music, but that's not it. Thank you!
Can an expert take a look at this configuration and tell me if it can handle large games (smoothly with special effects turned off) and mold design? How much do I need to spend on a graphics card? Is a graphics card that costs around 700 yuan good enough? Can I get a good one for around 3000 yuan? My friend used the same configuration and it works well for him.
Someone is posting inappropriate photos of minors, can I report them? What should I do about this kind of person? Don't pay attention to those foolish people. Just by looking at you, I can tell you're a good and upright person.
Excuse me, respected masters, among the mobile phone management applications such as 360 security guard, Baidu optimization master, and LBE security master, which one do you recommend downloading? Is LBE security master really good, or just average?
How to root a Samsung GT-I9128E? I've tried various one-click cracking methods but none of them worked!! It should be because there is not enough memory. You can try using Baidu's one-click root, but if that doesn't work, it means your memory is insufficient. If you have already tried the first option with Baidu and your 8GB SD card is still not enough, then it may be a problem with your phone. There are many phones that cannot be rooted because the corresponding cracking program has not been developed. My question is, which root software has been developed to crack the 9128e? If you don't know, please don't speak.
My eyeballs have always been resting on the upper eyelids. Is this called "xia san bai yan" (a type of eye shape in Chinese)? Are there any disadvantages? Your eyes are so beautiful, but I have been concerned about my nearsightedness for a long time. However, some people who are nearsighted don't have eyeballs like mine. Are your parents the same? My parents aren't like this, but they both have double eyelids. Only my eyeball is positioned upward.
Are my purchases from Le Gou website fake? Does anyone know the phone number? Online shopping has a 7-day no-reason return policy. Is 12315 the same as all complaint hotlines? I need Le Gou's phone number, yes, it's the 12315 consumer complaint hotline. You can return the goods. They don't answer the phone and don't reply to my messages. They disappeared completely. Then you should file a complaint against them.
"Please recommend well-categorized BL novels, the more the better, and they can be collected on Baidu Cloud. ""BL"" refers to ""Boys' Love,"" a genre of romantic fiction that focuses on romantic and sexual relationships between male characters."
After installing Youku, why can't it play? Is it because the phone only supports hardware decoding and the fake phone CPU can't support it? It used to work before, but now it's not. The reason for the video playback issue could be the computer hardware, such as an old computer. If you want to play games, it's better to upgrade your memory to 2GB and replace your graphics card with GTS450. You don't need to invest too much in the configuration.
Does it make sense to replace the CPU if it doesn't perform well? Your motherboard is also very old, and current mainstream processors are not supported. If you want to replace the processor, you will also need to replace the motherboard. In this case, it's better to build a completely new system. Regarding the issue of restoring the system, please consult an expert. You can enter the BIOS and then start the computer. Look for a ""One-Key Restore"" option on the desktop. However, this is only possible if you have backed up your data. If you can't start the computer, you may need to restore the system.
I am currently 180 jin and am losing weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, I wake up wanting to eat meat. Am I not a man or a woman? 180? Oh my God! If you are persistent, I will tell you the most scientific method. Can boys still be saved? Yes, how tall are you? 175? There are only three things in the body: sugar (energy), lipids (the main cause of obesity, fat), and protein. Targeted treatment is needed to reduce the amount of fat in the body. There are two ways: one is to control intake, and the other is to consume more. If you can persevere, I will tell you the specific method. Otherwise, typing is tiring, and I don't want to waste my energy. I have thought about it and I want to seriously lose weight. I am currently 180 jin and am losing weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, I wake up wanting to eat meat. Think about your wife seeing your big belly and your lover disliking your appearance, and you will have the motivation to lose weight. I'm afraid I can't do it.
Why did the verification fail when I followed the prompts to enter the verification code during WeChat registration? I just logged in using my QQ account instead. I don't have a QQ account and don't know how to apply for one. I should apply for one. I ask myself, should I sit in the office every day drinking tea, browsing the internet, watching movies, and making business calls, or should I travel to various places to visit clients in person? The latter is more effective, but it's also more expensive. I already owe 400,000 yuan in interest, which is a huge burden. However, if I want to gain something, I must give up something. Can I really connect with clients just by making phone calls? It's not enough to just have a sincere attitude. That makes sense.
Playing League of Legends is really demanding, because I don't want my graphics card to be too poor. Originally, my graphics card was over 500, but it's now old and I was advised to switch to playing LOL. Yeah, that jerk who fixed my computer charged me an extra 100 yuan and gave me a second-hand graphics card. If I upgrade to a better graphics card, will it still be slow? It's unlikely that just upgrading the graphics card alone will solve the problem, since your overall system configuration may not be high enough. Okay.
Why does my phone's browser display a blank page no matter what website I try to open? Why can't I open anything at all? It could be because of poor network signal, even though the Wi-Fi signal I'm using appears to be strong. I've tried deleting and re-downloading the browser, but it didn't work. Please accept my answer.
Why does my phone's browser show blank pages for any website I try to open? Why can't I open anything at all? I tried using a different browser but it didn't work either. It seems like my phone has been infected with a virus. How can I fix this? If not, it could be a problem with the host. I don't know, maybe I should call a professional to fix it.
This is a laptop. Is something wrong with it? I'm not sure. Thank you. Why is it like this when I turn it on? Is it broken? Hmm, maybe the connection is not good.
Is it easy to find a job after graduating from Liaoning University of Science and Technology with an associate degree? Are there any problems with undergraduate programs, and is it a mistake for female students to study accounting in a vocational program where the technical skills are strong? Do you know about Liaoning University of Science and Technology? I'm not familiar with it, is it a university? It is a second-tier university, but it also has a first-tier program. Oh, I see. So it has a program at the first-tier level but the overall university is at the second-tier level. Yes, that's right.
Why does League of Legends keep crashing and showing ""virtual memory too low"" even though my computer specs are good enough to play the game and I have only opened a web page game outside of it? The virtual memory warning should be caused by the web page taking up too much memory. I have followed the steps to fix the problem by downloading Driver Booster and updating my drivers, but it didn't work and the game still crashes, as of 1 minute ago. Try updating your graphics card driver, but don't choose the latest one, choose the most stable one. Your memory is already sufficient, and your processor exceeds 2.0 GHz, so you should be able to play the game. Try downloading Driver Booster and updating your drivers, it should solve the problem. I have followed the steps to fix the problem by downloading Driver Booster and updating my drivers, but it didn't work and the game still crashes. Right-click on ""My Computer"", select ""Properties"", then select ""Advanced"", and click on ""Performance Settings"". Click on ""Advanced"" and then click on ""Virtual Memory"". Change the value to 1.5 times your memory and it should be fixed.
How about using a hard fork in Java? For the Duke 600, should I replace it with a half-carbon or full-carbon? I'm considering it, but also afraid of spending too much money on a full-carbon. Should I go for the Shimano SLX or Deore? Can this be upgraded with a new graphics card? Your motherboard has a dedicated graphics card slot, so you can use a dedicated graphics card. It seems like there's no slot on the current graphics card. Can this still be upgraded with a new graphics card? Yes, but it wouldn't make much sense to upgrade since the current one is already bad. Even if you have a good graphics card, it won't help much. Can I replace both the motherboard and graphics card together? Yes, it's possible. I would recommend replacing them together with the CPU. What kind of replacement would be more functional? How is the fiber optic network charged? Our telecommunications company charges 1200 yuan per year for a 20Mbps plan. Can individuals apply for this plan as well, for personal home use? You can bring your ID card to the business office to apply for it. We live in a rural area and are afraid they won't provide the necessary cables. Which telecom company is commonly used in your village, China Telecom, China Mobile, or China Unicom? To be honest, nobody in our village has had a cable installed yet. I will be the first one. I suggest going to the business office in your local county town to inquire about the service.
Can you recommend a good-looking and personalized desktop? Is it for a smaller system desktop? Excuse me, are you looking for a phone or a computer desktop? If you want a phone desktop, I can quickly send you some selected personalized phone desktops. As for phone desktops, how about downloading 91 Desktop? I think that software is pretty good. It's for a phone, but it's better if it's smaller and easier to fit into the system. The icon display should also be smaller. Thank you. What is the size of your phone screen, approximately in pixels? It is system 4.1.2 and the screen is 4.0.
Is there any software that can completely change the background of a photo? How about trying Meitu Xiuxiu? No, it can only add a mosaic effect. How about Baidu Motu? None of them work. There is a software called Photoshop Express in English, try it out. But it's all in English and I can't understand it at all. Well, there's nothing we can do, this is the most professional one! Hahaha, thanks. You're welcome, sorry we couldn't solve the problem. Is there any software that can completely change the background of a photo? Can I use Photoshop on my phone? Can you check if there is a mobile version available? Yes, but they are all in English. Then I can't do anything about it! You have to figure it out yourself! Or you can do it on your computer and then transfer it to your phone when it's done! Oh, I see.
I am currently at 180 pounds and am trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, when I wake up, I want to eat meat. Maybe my stomach capacity has become too large, but I need to gradually control myself. I am currently eating instant noodles and chicken drumsticks, and I can't control myself! Does this mean I am hopeless? It depends on how strong your motivation to lose weight is. Don't eat anymore, stop now! I am currently at 180 pounds and am trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, when I wake up, I want to eat meat. It's okay, go ahead and eat! But try to walk more and do more exercise on the playground. Whenever I walk, my legs hurt, and I can't even run.
Why is it that when I use 4s to check for nearby people, I can see others but they can't see me? Please help. I have turned on location and tried restarting it multiple times. It's like WeChat, should I delete and reinstall it with the updated version? The system is different and software information updates slowly, so I can wait for a day and try again. Can someone tell me what's wrong with my tablet? It shows three bars of WiFi, but why can't it connect to the internet while other devices can? I went to WiFi settings and tried changing it from DHC P to DHCP. It's now DHCP but still not working. The signal varies from one bar to three bars. Can someone tell me what's wrong with my tablet? It shows three bars of WiFi, but why can't it connect to the internet while other devices can? Have you tried restarting it? If that doesn't work, try going closer to the WiFi source. If that doesn't work either, you may need to reset it. I just reset it today. I tried it again and it showed full bars but still didn't work. My WiFi signal keeps dropping, what's going on? You can try resetting your router's WiFi settings. That means resetting the router and creating a new WiFi network. Is that possible? Sometimes the router may have issues, but most of the time it's not the case. However, now we have to try everything we can. Can you try connecting to someone else's WiFi to see if it works?
Can anyone tell me what's wrong with my tablet? The WIFI has three bars, but why can't it connect to the internet? Other devices can connect, but not my tablet. The router is fine because other devices can connect to it. Someone else with the same brand of tablet said they didn't have this problem. If the WIFI can connect, then try restarting the tablet. Is the n12 single-core or...? I'm currently replying to you using the original mini one. Someone suggested I restart it, but it still doesn't work. I looked up the configuration of the n12 and it has low-end hardware, similar to my Teclast a10t. Android hardware updates too quickly. As hardware is updated, software is also updated, so low-end hardware can't keep up with new software. Your tablet probably can only be used as an mp3 player now. I've had it for two years and have an emotional attachment to it, so I don't want to get rid of it. But there's no choice, the hardware is too low, but it might still be able to run certain games. Original brand tablets are not that good, so I suggest buying something else. Anyway, now I have a mini one. It's best to buy the newest tablet. The hardware of Android tablets probably won't be updated much now, and these updates won't necessarily update the software. So currently, it's best to buy an octa-core tablet that can be used for a long time.
Have you ever used the homework help software called "作业帮" (Zuoyebang)? Do you think it's easy or difficult to use? I feel like people in there are just chatting about irrelevant things, and there aren't really many questions about homework. When I posted my homework questions, I wanted to get some ideas, not to ask someone else to do the work for me. What I meant was that the questions I posted were ones that I had been thinking about for a long time but didn't understand, not questions that I was too lazy to do myself and wanted someone else to do for me.

If it's not there, reinstall Office 2007. I'm at the desktop step, should I unzip it or what should I do? What software did you use to install it? Can you show me a screenshot? It's just a website address, I couldn't find it on eDonkey.
The computer originally had the Windows 8 (WN8) system. I want to change to Windows 7, but encounter this problem. Does anyone know how to solve it? The hard disk format of W8 and W7 is different, so it needs to be formatted, repartitioned, and then reinstalled. Can you provide a detailed explanation of how you installed the system?

At noon today, I had some bok choy from the school cafeteria, which had a strong smell of alcohol. I only ate a small piece. Will there be any problem? Don't worry, if there is any issue with the school food, they will have a great responsibility. Since you only ate a small piece, there should be no problem. It smells a bit like an anesthetic. Do you know what's going on?
Where is the best place to buy a Telecom version of an unlocked iPhone 4S that is both cost-effective and ensures that it is authentic? If you want a cost-effective and authentic phone, then you should choose a contract phone, which comes with a lock. China Telecom calculates your expenses down to every day, so the contract phone is the best option. Unfortunately, it has a lock. Therefore, you should buy it from a physical store. The price may not be the cheapest, and online purchases cannot guarantee that the product is genuine. Shopping has risks, but you can check the usage of the phone based on its serial number after receiving it.
Where is the best place to buy a telecommunications version of the iPhone 4S without a contract? And how can I ensure that it is genuine? I recommend going to a JD.com physical store or the official website to get the best deal and guarantee that it's an authentic product.
Can you use game cards to buy the CD-key for Guild Wars 2 on the official website? It now requires an activation code. I'm talking about the public beta CD-keys that were released on April 1st. My computer screen is black when I turn it on, and restarting it doesn't work. Is the computer turning on? Is the monitor receiving power? There is a display for Windows updates. How should I buy a good computer for gaming? What do you want to use it for specifically? Playing games? Look for recommended system requirements on the game's official website to determine what games you want to play.
I am currently at 180 pounds and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, when I wake up I want to eat meat.

Then put the downloaded files in the folder and extract them. Finally, open the One-Key System Restore software and restore the system.
During the renovation, a wired television cable and a red and white audio cable were buried. The set-top box that came out had red, white, and yellow cables, but was missing a yellow cable.

As long as the connection points are linked properly, can I use any type of wire? Yes, as long as it is the same type of wire. The color-coding of the wires is for you to accurately connect the two ends together. It is not the same type of wire! It is an old wired television cable! Can it be used as the yellow cable for the AV three-color cable? Yes, it can.

You can try searching on Baidu for "software to recover deleted files," there should be many options.

Contact customer service and ask for the real name to match the name on the Netease Bao account. Changing the registered name on Netease Bao seems to be troublesome, so it's best to inquire with customer service to find a solution.
Why is there no activity on the WAN? Maybe the Ethernet cable is not plugged in properly or the password/account is incorrect. But why can I receive a Wi-Fi signal? My phone cannot connect to the Internet. If the router has power, the phone should be able to find the WAN, and if the LAN is working, the phone should be able to connect to the Internet. 
Can I set up the router on my phone? You must use a computer to set up the router. The two screenshots earlier were taken on my phone. You should set it up using a computer. The LAN port of my Asus laptop is a snap-on design. The Ethernet cable is loose and I need to use something to prop it up to connect to the internet. How can I fix this? If it is unlikely to be caused by other factors, try using a network cable with a standard crystal head. If it works, it is recommended to contact Asus sales support. I don't know if the cable I bought from the school store has a standard crystal head. I just randomly picked one. Can I ask where I can find Ethernet cables with more standardized crystal heads?

Okay, I'll give it a try.

Maybe there is some operation going on in the background of my phone.
"Currently, is it possible to crack wireless networks on mobile phones, and how can it be done? There's a software called ""Universal Unlock"" that works well. Have you tested it yourself? Last October, my mother was hit by someone. After reporting it to the police and going to mediation, the other party was waiting outside with a bunch of agreements, but I didn't think too much of it. Just said to go ahead and settle it. Thank you. Can the court accept the accident determination if there is no accident determination document? Was the police officer present at the scene? The police were there, and there's a record of the private settlement. If not, maybe someone within the police department is involved. You should find a lawyer to help you, and sue them. Some have also gone to the accident processing unit, but now the police officer says they can only give me the agreement, and not the accident determination document." Sue them. If you sue, the police will have to get involved and they will have to handle it. Thank you...
What software is available to restrict background programs or startup applications on an Android phone, so that they don't automatically start up or run in the background? Hello, if you don't mind using Phone Manager, you can also try 360 Mobile Security or Tencent Mobile Manager. As a volunteer from Tencent, to be honest, 360 is better, but we have to recommend our own company's software. How much is your salary? I used to work at Yixun.com, but they were so unethical. After I quit, they only paid me half my salary. Tencent is also pretty tough. I'm sorry, it's not allowed to discuss salaries within the company. We are just volunteers, so of course our salary is not as high as the employees.
What software can restrict Android phone background programs or auto-starting programs when booting up, and lock them so they won't restart or run in the background again? Can 360 Mobile Guard be restarted and will it auto-start again? Even the 360 Mobile Assistant on the computer can be modified, I will do it today. With an Intel Core 4th generation I5 4570 3.2G HZ CPU and a Micro-Star B85M-E45 motherboard, this is a high-end configuration. If possible, upgrading to 8GB of RAM would be even better. If the RAM is already 8GB, then it goes without saying that it can handle gaming easily.
May I ask how to create a new file using C language? "fopen(const char path, const char mode)" is the function you need. Selecting "w" mode clears the contents of the file and creates a new file when storing, while selecting "a" mode opens the file in append mode for writing only. When using "a" mode, new data will be added to the end of the file. Isn't this function used to open a file? There are only a few functions in the C standard library, and the specific function of "fopen" depends on the selected mode. Alternatively, you can use "tmpfile," but this function is essentially "wb+" and creates a temporary file that will be automatically deleted when closed. Can you recommend a customer relationship management system? You can try to download and try the free trial. If you can't find the download location, you can search on Baidu to access the website and go to the download center to download. Alternatively, you can ask customer service for the link.

Why is it that when I sort my music on Baidu Music, the order gets messed up after I exit and reopen the app? Hmm, what's going on? Is it because my computer has a virus? Don't keep looking at things you shouldn't, you men are all the same. You're a lunatic. It's because of your phone. If it's your phone, then delete it and reinstall it. I've tried that already, I don't have any other suggestions.
I have already added a bank card to my Alipay account. Taobao sellers said they will refund through Alipay. What is the difference between that and refunding to a bank card? When I used Alipay to pay for purchases and received a refund, I clicked on the purchased item in the "already bought" section to see if there was any indication of the refund, such as "refund successful". If your phone is not linked to Alipay, you won't receive any messages. If it is linked, you can check the status of the purchase record to see if it says "refund pending" or "refund successful". What I mean is, after the refund is successful, Alipay shows that the refund has been credited to my account, but the balance is still zero. Did you use Alipay or a bank card to make the payment? I used a bank card to make the payment. The seller doesn't know that I used a bank card, they usually use Alipay, which is why they told me the refund would be made to Alipay. I'm sure the money will be refunded to my bank card, but it might take a bit longer, although it should arrive within one day. I have experience with this.
I have already added a bank card to my Alipay account. Taobao sellers said that refunds would be credited to my Alipay account, so what is the difference between that and a bank card? On my phone, I'm not sure whether you have bound a debit card or a credit card. If it is a credit card, the refund will be directly returned to the credit card, but it may take one or two days. If it is a debit card, you can withdraw the money from your Alipay account to your linked debit card or savings card, and the refund will be displayed in your Alipay account balance. Unless you have already withdrawn the balance, your balance should still be 0. In your case, you should have received a refund of 8 yuan, and you used it to recharge your phone with 10 yuan, so you only paid 2 yuan. However, the transaction details show that the 8 yuan refund has already been credited to your account. You can try transferring the remaining 2 yuan to your bank account. Your account balance should be 0, but it may appear in your Yu'EBao account. The balance of your Yu'EBao account is 0, I'm not sure why, maybe your phone hasn't updated yet. Anyway, I have already added a bank card to my Alipay account. Taobao sellers usually refund the money to your Alipay account, but sometimes they may choose to refund to your bank card instead, depending on their own convenience. When the money is refunded to your Alipay account, you will see the balance increase by the corresponding amount. This is normal, and the refunded money can be automatically used for your next purchase on Taobao, even if it's not enough and needs to be combined with other linked bank cards. It won't affect anything. If you still don't understand, next time you make a purchase on Taobao, the system will automatically remind you that you have this balance available to use. But I didn't receive any reminders. I made another purchase later, but still didn't receive any reminders. You can download the Taobao app on your phone, and it will remind you with a shortcut payment method. You should be able to see the reminder. As for adding a bank card to your Alipay account, if you paid with a card, the refund will be credited back to the same card you used for payment. If you paid with your Alipay balance, the refund will be credited back to your Alipay account. If you paid with online banking, the refund should have been credited to your bank account. Have you checked your bank account? It may take one or two days for the refund to show up. Have you linked your bank account to your Alipay account? Then the refund will be credited to your bank account, so don't worry. Your current issue is that the refund has been received, but it is not showing in your bank account, and your Alipay balance is also showing 0.

Working in another city. Today is my birthday, but my phone is turned off. I don't want to tell my friends because I don't want to be ignored. I bought a cake and celebrated it by myself! Can netizens give me some blessings? Happy birthday! Thank you.
I'm currently at 180 pounds and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do, especially at night when I wake up wanting to eat meat? Am I hopeless? Playing computer and phone games can help distract me, and I play them every day while eating. You're awesome.
