Who can help me look up the IP address of this QQ user? It would be best if there's a detailed address. They're a scammer who cheated me out of 200 yuan! Using QQ IP addresses without a proxy can only accurately locate a specific area. Besides, even if the scammer used QQ, you still can't trace their address. It seems they're still using it. In that case, you can try downloading a QQ version that displays IP addresses.
Who can help me find the IP address of this QQ account? It would be best to have a detailed address. It's from a scammer who scammed me out of 200 yuan!!!

How can I flash my phone? Can you please give some advice? Different models may have different methods. If your phone supports one-click flashing, you can download a flashing tool, then enable USB debugging on your phone, connect your phone to the computer, and the flashing tool will automatically download the drivers. After the drivers are downloaded, find the ROM package (i.e., the flashing package) you want to flash, download it to your computer, and then open the ROM package in the one-click flashing section of the flashing tool. Click on the flash button, and it will be done automatically. Thank you. After flashing my Huawei C8812, it became a brick. What should I do? You should get it repaired! It turned into a brick. Reinstalling the system will fix it. How can I reinstall it? You should have someone else fix it! It's hard to do it yourself. How much would it cost to fix it? Around 70 (currency not specified) should be enough!
What is the difference between an original packaged CPU and a loose piece? There is no difference, except one is without packaging and the other is with packaging. Loose pieces are more likely to be fake. Do original packaged CPUs come with a heat sink, and is it enough? How is this configuration? It should be able to play large-scale single-player games and watch high-definition videos. It should be sufficient for most use cases but may struggle with large-scale games. For a similar price range, I recommend a GPU like the Radeon HD 7770 over the GeForce GTX 650 as it's slightly stronger. Can you please suggest a configuration within a budget of 3000? Do you need a monitor? Yes. How is this configuration? It should be able to play large-scale single-player games and watch high-definition videos. This configuration may not be able to handle all special effects in large-scale games, but it's absolutely fine for watching high-definition movies. I hope my answer can help you. Without special effects, as long as it runs smoothly, it's fine.
I want to ask a question. There's a newly decorated internet cafe nearby. All the equipment is new, and you can play "Need for Speed 14" with all the special effects turned up to the highest level without any lag. What's the computer configuration? How much does it cost? Even the worst internet cafes have dedicated graphics cards, but my computer has an integrated graphics card. Three years ago, internet cafe computers could run "Need for Speed" faster than my 3000 yuan computer, and I'm sure it will lag while playing the game on my 4500 yuan computer.
In the Love Apartment, is Bingrui or Rum pre-mixed cocktail better to drink? Rio tastes better, Bingrui looks better, Rio feels like it has a higher alcohol content, but the label shows it's lower than Bingrui. What about the Rum pre-mixed cocktail? It's okay. Which one is better to drink, Bingrui or Rum pre-mixed cocktail? The second one... which one? The Rum.
I'd like to ask a question. There's a newly-opened internet cafe nearby with brand new equipment. Playing "Need for Speed 14" with the highest graphics settings doesn't lag at all. The computer specs might be different, like the system storage capacity. What is system storage capacity? Is it referring to a specific disk or something? Do you know what GB means? If you don't know, I think you're just a fool. The internet cafe's single-player game disk is 1024G. Is this the difference? How can I download the "Soulmate Friendship" app? There's no client, so I can only use a browser. Oh
How can I download the "Zhi Ji Jiao You" app? Is this an app? I haven't used it before. Is it good, original poster? Please introduce it. I don't know, I've used it on a computer, but can it be used on a phone? I just don't know how to download it. Can it only be accessed through a website, and there's no mobile app, right?
Where can I download 1080p HD movies? I don't want to use torrent or Xunlei downloads, as they are too slow. With Xunlei, it only becomes fast when you become a member and use the high-speed channel and offline downloads. I have an Android device, and the speed test shows that I have a few hundred kbps, but Xunlei downloads are only a few kbps. That's so frustrating!
My computer monitor keeps going black, what's going on? (It turns black after being on for half a minute, then it's fine if I turn it off and on again! But it goes black again after another half minute! It doesn't seem to be a motherboard issue, but a screen issue. Turning the monitor power off and on again fixes it temporarily, but it goes black again after a while. A few days ago, my friend's computer had the same problem, and it was fixed after they replaced the screen with a new one. This solution is not bad, solving the problem at once. When replacing the screen, pay attention to the price and don't get scammed.

Maybe I should go to a computer repair shop and have a look, but it's very troublesome. The computer repair people also seem to have no words about the monitor issue. Yeah, it's particularly bothersome.
My computer monitor keeps going black, what's going on! (It goes black after being on for half a minute, and then if I turn it off and on again, it works! But then it goes black again after half a minute!) It's not the main cable at the back of your monitor being loose, is it? Everything works fine, but then it goes black! Turning the monitor power off and on works temporarily, but then it goes black again. There might be a problem with your monitor's power cable; try using the power cable from your rice cooker at home. My monitor is a TV-style monitor.

But after half a minute, it goes black again. Isn't the main display port connected properly? Everything was fine, and suddenly it goes black! I turn off the monitor power and turn it back on, and it works again! But after a while, it goes black again. I suggest you try changing the monitor power cord and try using your rice cooker's cord. Mine has a TV-style monitor, as long as the voltage is not a problem! I really don't know what's going on."
The Samsung S4 has been upgraded to 4.42, but why did it fail to root with the 360 One-click Root? Did you use the 360 One-click Root on your phone? You should connect your phone to the computer and use the 360 One-click Root on the computer. That's how I did it on my phone, and it was successful. I uninstalled many pre-installed programs. Give it a try. As for the failed root, haha, I'm not sure then, sorry I couldn't help you.
The following Chinese sentences translated into English are: "Why did the Samsung S4 upgrade to 4.42 fail to use 360 one-click root? Go download Baidu one-click root. Is Baidu's one-click root temporary? I want a temporary one-click root."
The company I work for requires employees to purchase a car in order to continue working. After buying a car, the company provides a subsidy of 88 RMB for the car. If you don't buy a car, you will automatically resign. I wonder what brand of car is cheaper than BYD F0 and Jiangnan TT, or maybe a second-hand one. Some second-hand Xiali cars only cost a few thousand. It depends on whether you dare to drive them! The company requires buying a brand-new car. As far as I know, Jiangnan TT is the cheapest at 20,800 RMB. That's too expensive. I only have 20,000 RMB, and that also needs to cover the cost of getting a license plate and a driver's license. It's so difficult, impossible to achieve!
The following Chinese sentences are translated into English: 三星s4升级4.42了用360一键root失败为什么 Why did the Samsung S4 upgrade to 4.42 fail using 360 one-click root? 升级安卓系统会变得更卡，手机root后系统也会变得更卡。 Upgrading the Android system can cause it to be more laggy, and the system may also become more laggy after rooting the phone. 可是都已经升级了 那就不要root了 But it's already upgraded, so you don't need to root it. 虽然用的有些不方便 Although it's a bit inconvenient to use. 不root很费流量的，9有很多自启软件 Not rooting consumes a lot of data, and there are many self-starting apps in version 9. 那随你便吧，s4运行速度快，估计root卡也卡不到哪去 Well, it's up to you. The S4 has fast performance, so even if you root it, it probably won't become too laggy. 我知道，只不过有时加入一个头文件如dos.h结果vc显示未命名之类的结果 I know, it's just that sometimes when I add a header file like dos.h, the result is that VC displays something like an unnamed result.

What is the difference between Baihe.com's Crystal Membership and Senior Membership? What services are good on Baihe.com? Scam website, just for making money. Why?

We went to two pet hospitals. One said it was not a problem, while the other said it was severe and required injections for one month. Check if there are any small red dots on the skin, as it might be mites. Use 886887 or dichlorvos if there are no small red dots.
The computer cannot start when the Seagate Backup Plus portable hard drive is connected. It's simple, plug in the portable hard drive after entering the WIN7 system, as some mobile storage devices have this issue. When starting up, it will try to boot directly from the connected mobile storage device, but some devices won't do that. You don't want to plug and unplug the portable hard drive every time you turn the computer on and off. Sometimes, when the computer starts up and the portable hard drive is still connected, it won't boot up, and you have to force a restart. The hard drive is not visible. Go into BIOS when booting up and change the hard drive mode to IDE or compatibility mode, don't use ACHI, as some PE systems won't recognize it. Or you can go online and download a partition software called DiskGenius, copy it to your USB drive, and run it under PE. DiskGenius and DiskMan in PE can initially recognize a 7.9G hard drive but can't read its size, and later it is not recognized anymore. The 7.9G is your Kingston USB drive, go into BIOS and change the hard drive working mode, try compatibility mode or IDE, or you can directly install WIN7 or use WIN7 PE to see the hard drive. What is the memory bit width of a shared memory graphics card? Kids these days, why are you still looking at graphics memory? You should look at the graphics card chip model! This is an integrated graphics card, even if it has 15G of graphics memory, its performance will not be as good as a high-end discrete graphics card. If you don't know, don't comment recklessly. If you don't believe it, just check the position of your integrated graphics card on the graphics card hierarchy chart. Consider the graphics memory and bit width, okay? Graphics memory is now only related to resolution. Bit width is generally related to anti-aliasing. If you'd rather believe in the graphics memory myths, don't reply to me. Anyway, when I judge the quality of a graphics card, I look at the graphics card chip and the stream processors. Graphics memory and bit width are the least important factors.
What is the fastest hard disk read/write speed? The average seek time for an SSD is 0.1 milliseconds, for a 15,000 RPM hard disk it's about 5 milliseconds, and for a 10,000 RPM hard disk it's around 7 milliseconds. Desktop computers nowadays use 7,200 RPM hard disks while laptops generally use 5,400 RPM hard disks, the read/write speeds don't differ too much, just in the seek times. Can you be more specific? When I play CrossFire, it's so laggy, and my FPS is only 50. My CPU can't keep up. Before entering the game, lower the resolution, set it to 60Hz, and decrease the contrast. You can also close a software before entering the game and set attributes like bullet marks and weather to low. I didn't have this lag two days ago, but now I do. I went to the computer store and they said my graphics card is fine. A low FPS isn't determined solely by the graphics card; the CPU is the processor. If the graphics card can keep up but the CPU can't, it will still be laggy. So try the solutions above, your FPS should increase quite a bit. Also, playing with an AK with low FPS won't be affected too much. Why is my CrossFire so laggy with only 50 FPS? If your internet speed is not good enough, it will be like this. As long as your internet speed is good enough, having 100 FPS is not a problem. My internet speed is 6 Mbps, and the ping is 12, so it's impossible that it's due to the internet speed.
My child is nearly 4 years old and is taken care of by his grandmother in the countryside. He hid by the roadside during a market day but was still hit by a car.

Samsung Galaxy S3, after entering the unlock password, it automatically locks the screen again, and it keeps repeating this process.

Search on Baidu, and you'll know how to do it. Thank you.

If you say so, there's nothing I can do. I'll add you as a friend, but I don't know if you'll accept my request. Hehe. I've sent it. How does it feel to use it? Scanning will take four hours! Hehe... sorry about that. I'm truly grateful; all my data has been recovered.

In mid-February 2014, there was a traffic accident (a Chang'an Star scraped a Lexus; no one was hurt! Just the paint was scratched). The traffic police ruled a week, including Saturday and Sunday as two days off, which is basically eight or nine days. I checked my account! It's been a month now, and the insurance claim still hasn't been settled! When I called, they just said they would do it as soon as possible.
How to add a hard drive to an IBM x3650 server? First, you need to be familiar with ServeRAID Manager or enter the RAID configuration interface (Ctrl+A) during machine startup. For this model of the machine, the hard drive must be configured through the RAID card before it can be recognized by the operating system, so the newly added hard drive must be an Array or a simple volume. The newly added drive cannot be added to an existing Array; it can only create a new Array or a simple volume. Therefore, you need to use ServeRAID Manager or press Ctrl+A during startup to enter the RAID card and create a new Array or simple volume. Then, in the operating system's disk management, 'rescan the disk' to discover the hard drive, partition, format, assign volume labels, and it will be available for use. For machines with model number MT: 7979, you cannot

"DaHua hard disk recorder remote monitoring setup: I used it like this for my company. First, turn on the network function of the DaHua recorder and test it within the local area network (LAN) to see if it is visible. Then, set up the DMZ host in the router and fill in the internal IP of the recorder. Finally, turn on the domain name function of the router - TP routers have this feature (Peanut Shell). If not, please try updating the router firmware version on the TP website... Our company's router originally didn't have this feature, but after updating, it did... Of course, you still need to apply for a domain name yourself. I can see it on the LAN, and I followed your instructions for the rest, including applying for a domain name. But I don't know what to enter when I access it from the external network. Have you bound the domain name and DMZ host (which is your recorder's internal IP) in the router? If you have, you can directly enter the domain name in the external network to browse your recorder. I've set everything up, but when I enter the website address at home, the page cannot be displayed. I'm not sure if this is the case - my Peanut Shell domain name is this website address. My phone suddenly displayed stripes and then went black. The stripes also appeared in various colors. The screen is either broken or the internal screen is loose, assessment complete. Could it not be a problem with the ribbon cable?"

I always thought it was a problem with the router, so I bought a new one, but the network is still unstable. However, you should contact the service provider to completely solve the problem. This involves issues with your home router network cable and the server responsible for your area. I contacted the service provider, and they said that as long as I can access the internet, it's not within their jurisdiction and told me to contact the router seller. I've tried several routers, and they all have the same problem. First, check if your computer or router has set any timers. I don't think so. I never set timers. Has anyone else touched it? No. I just called the 10000 number, and they also said that my network is normal.

They just left after it was done.
I want to change my graphics card, please recommend one!!! Experts, look at my setup. The current graphics card configuration is really useless. Everything is wrong, especially the CPU with high cost-performance ratio. It is recommended to add another 4G of memory. I recommend the 660 and 7850 graphics cards for their cost-performance ratio. The 660's performance is about 15% higher than the 7850, but the price is 200 higher. It's suitable for your configuration, and you can play mainstream games easily. Sapphire HD7850 1G GDDR5 Platinum Edition ￥1099. Inno3D GTX660 Ice Dragon Edition ￥1299. Is there anything else you want to change? You don't need to change anything else. It won't improve performance much. If you think the game or software loading speed is slow, you can consider adding a solid-state drive.

Begging for antivirus software experts: Nowadays, many antivirus software automatically push virus database updates, such as NOD32, Kaspersky, etc. Just set it to auto-update. Expert: What I mean is that banks use local area networks, and my idea is to push updates directly to each person's terminal through the server side, without the need for the terminal staff to operate, thus saving a lot of manpower and resources. Is there no feasible method that doesn't require client-side operations? Please check my computer configuration; I want to upgrade it with around 1,000 RMB. If I upgrade the CPU on the original motherboard, it won't bring a qualitative leap, so I'm considering: 1. Upgrading to an i5 3470 + a 250 RMB H61 motherboard for a total of 1,300 RMB, and then add a better graphics card to achieve a mid-to-high-end configuration. 2. Upgrading to an i3 3240 + a B75 motherboard for a total of 1,000 RMB, and then add a graphics card. Will merely replacing the graphics card not have any effect? If I change the motherboard, is it better to buy a new computer altogether? How can I repair the disk recovery sector? If you only need to repair the disk recovery sector, you can use the built-in disk tool in the system. If that doesn't work, you can use partition software to organize the disk partition. If you need to recover data, you'll need to use data recovery software like "DataExplore Data Recovery," "Data Recovery Master," and similar software to recover the data first, then process the disk.

I've helped friends partition XP, Vista, and Win7. It also has a merge function and non-destructive partitioning features. I used to use Partition Magic before switching to Acronis Disk Director Suite because it's better. Is it available in Chinese? Is it difficult to learn? I want to merge the extra partition and evenly distribute it among the other four partitions. It used to be in English, and I prefer using the English version as it's more stable. There's a Chinese version too, but I'm worried about issues arising from using a localized version. If partitioning is not done correctly, data might be lost. By now, there should be a Chinese version available. It has a graphical interface, and you can perform the operations first. Once you see the partitions meet your requirements, click Apply, and the partitioning will start. You'll need to restart the computer, and then wait. Be careful not to lose power, or you'll run into big problems. Distributing the space evenly among other partitions is not an issue; you just need to do the division yourself. For example, if you have 10GB, you can allocate 2.5GB to each partition. The graphical interface is quite clear. I personally recommend that you first install a virtual machine and practice partitioning on the virtual machine. Once you're familiar with the process, you can proceed with the actual operation, as safety comes first. First, download one to give it a try.
The office Excel opens slowly, seeking solutions. Large files are naturally slow. It's not a problem on other computers, which indicates that the computer has software compatible with Office. Mainly check the antivirus software, as some antivirus software has compatibility issues with Office. Now, this problem occurs on everyone's computer, so it should not be related to the configuration. Or, I feel that the long opening time may be related to the Print Spooler service, but I'm not sure how to configure it. Also, using WPS to open the file is much faster, but the compatibility between WPS and Office is not perfect, especially for complex spreadsheets. After editing with WPS and transferring back to Office, there may be formatting errors or even the need for repairs. If possible, add an SSD solid-state drive, which can greatly improve the overall running speed of the machine.
The office Excel opens slowly, seeking a solution. It might be due to a large file or the system. The system and software have been freshly reinstalled. The hard drive is an SSD, so the speed should be sufficient. What I don't understand is why disabling the Print Spooler resolves the issue. How can I solve the problem of not being able to access the local disk E? It might be a permission issue. Try entering the disk with superuser permissions and modify the permissions. I am the administrator, but even after modifying the permissions, the problem persists. It has been resolved, so I'll give you some points.

When the router is disconnected from the internet, first unplug the network cable from the router and plug it directly into the computer to test if you can access the internet by dialing up. If you can, it's a problem with the router. Disconnect the router's power, reconnect it, and restart the network. If there are no issues with the network and the router frequently disconnects, it may be a quality issue with the router. It's better to get a more stable one. My router has only been disconnected once in a year. I use a Swift wireless router for home use, which costs 90 yuan. You can try my method and I hope it helps. My router has also been disconnecting frequently these past few days, but it didn't used to do that. I have encountered this situation before, so you need to test it according to my method and see if you can access the internet without the router by direct dialing. If you cannot, it's a problem with the internet service provider, not the router. You have to test it to find out.
The router is disconnected. Go to the router interface - Network Parameters - WAN Port Settings - select "Automatic Connection" and click Save. It has always been set to automatic connection. Your screenshot clearly shows "connect on demand." The screenshot refreshes every 5 seconds. If you didn't send the wrong screenshot, then follow the steps I provided: Network Parameters - WAN Port Settings - MAC Address Cloning - Clone MAC Address - Network Parameters - WAN Port Settings - select "Automatic Connection" and click Save.
The router is disconnected. Go to the router interface and reset it. I've already restored the router to factory settings and reset it, but it's still the same.

You should call customer service to ask, so you don't miss the repayment date!
My computer cannot connect to the router, what's the problem? It doesn't work when it comes to automatically obtaining the IP address. It always fails to obtain automatically. My system is Windows 7. Are you sure you haven't plugged the wires incorrectly? Maybe you've reversed the modem's wire with the router's wire. I'll try switching them back and forth. Thank you. Let me put it this way: you don't need to plug in the modem's wire; as long as you have connected the router and the router is turned on, it should automatically obtain the IP. Follow the instructions to plug in the wires properly and then reset the router to factory settings to resolve the issue. Remember, the wires must be plugged in correctly.
My computer cannot connect to the router, what's the problem? It doesn't work when it comes to automatically obtaining the IP address. It always fails to obtain automatically. My system is Windows 7. Try using another device, such as a phone, to see if it can detect and use the network. If you don't have another device, restart the router. That is, unplug and plug the router's power back in and try again (this situation is quite common). My phone can detect the network, but it cannot be used properly. In that case, try restarting the router, and also, is your router connected to the internet? In other words, have you set up the internet account? It seems like I haven't. How do you go online then? If it's a newly purchased router, you won't be able to access the internet without setting up a dial-up connection in the router. Alright, thank you. I'll try again. If I don't understand something, I'll ask you again, okay? Sure, if you don't know how to set it up, you can refer to the instruction manual or call customer service. Don't worry too much. Once you set it up, you'll know how to do it.

Thank you. You're welcome, it's my pleasure to help.

I think you are more suited for a middle part.

Why can't I use the WiFi even though I'm connected, while others can use it, and there's no limit on the number of users? Try turning off your device and see. I've tried that, I just don't understand. In that case, just wait a bit. If there are too many people, some might get disconnected due to network prioritization. Same issue. You should ask the mobile service provider then. Oh, okay.

I bought a new hard drive, it's a Seagate hard drive with SATA 37200 RPM, how do I connect it? 6G/S represents SATA3 interface, 3G/S represents SATA2 interface, and IDE interface (which is not available on most new motherboards) and RAID (matrix).

How do I perform a low-level format on a hard drive in DOS? You can find a low-level formatting program on the motherboard; many motherboards have this feature. You can use DOS6 boot system to run DM for low-level formatting on the hard drive. Alternatively, you can boot the computer with a CD and choose the DOS toolbox from the CD menu to perform low-level formatting using DM directly. Friendly reminder: if you need to perform a low-level format on a hard drive to thoroughly remove viruses, you only need to delete all partitions and create new partitions. Thank you for the reminder. My hard drive has bad sectors, and I heard that low-level formatting can shield bad sectors. I have no choice but to do this! However, I don't know how to perform low-level formatting. Low-level formatting can only solve logical bad sectors, not physical bad sectors. In fact, logical bad sectors can be solved by deleting all partitions and creating new partitions (if there are not many bad sectors). I made a mistake; nowadays, motherboards rarely have low-level formatting programs, but the GHOST version of CDs usually has a DOS toolbox.
May I ask how to delete the default network settings in Windows 7? Please disable the sharing of Wireless Network Connection 2 for its users. May I ask how to set it up?

How can I control two computers with one monitor in a home setting with internet access? You could buy a video splitter, which allows you to connect multiple computers. Hehe. How do I do it through remote desktop?
Are there any families with twins? My twin daughters are over two weeks old, and they often fight over things. I buy them clothes, toys, and everything else. I hope the sisters can be united as they grow up, but they sometimes act like enemies. Actually, there are solutions. At night, I take the younger one aside and tell her to listen to her older sister, who will protect her. I also tell the older one that as the oldest in the family, she needs to take care of her younger sister. Whoever listens will be considered the younger sister. It's easy to deal with young children. As a mother, you need to be patient and keep going. It's okay, this method doesn't work. I repeat it every day, and they nod and agree at the time, but when they fight, they completely ignore it.

Are there families with twins? My twin daughters are over two weeks old, and they often fight over things. I buy them clothes, toys, and everything else, which are actually the same. But let me tell you a method: when you buy toys for the children, don't give them directly. Instead, let each of them complete a task that is not too easy but not too difficult for them. The child who finishes first can choose a toy first, but she must help her sister complete her task before she can get the toy. Ah! Being a parent is so difficult.

What does she mean? Haha, there is hope! She even took the initiative to comment! Speaking from a girl's perspective, this is usually a test to see how you respond.

How exactly do we do this? Is there a conflict between the microcontroller's external interrupt and the timer? Please help me take a look at the program~ The external interrupt has a chance to make the timer stop working or no longer interrupt. First of all, your Timer 1 is in mode 0 (13-bit counter), and unless you use a very low-frequency external crystal, the timing of Timer 1 is not at the second level. Secondly, you didn't post the location where the time run flag is modified. If you suspect that Timer 1 is not continuously working, you can temporarily remove the if (time run == 1) condition and observe whether the digital tube displays changing values each time. By the way, the statements in your Timer 0 interrupt are inefficient, which is not a healthy interrupt service function. Interrupt service functions should be concise and fast. Regarding the second point, I have tried removing the time run, but the problem remains the same. For the third point, I have tried moving the contents of timer 0 to another function, and then adding an a=1 in timer 0. In the main function, I added if (a==1) {run the function just mentioned here}, and the first line of the function wrote a=0, trying to "slim down" the interrupt service program, but the program didn't work. As for the infrared remote control part, I didn't have a deep understanding of it since I took the information due to time constraints.
The translation for the Chinese sentences is: "What antivirus software do computers use nowadays? Is the determined Kingsoft (DuBa) good to use? Of course, we use Kingsoft on these laptops."
Computer configuration: The configuration can definitely handle playing GTA4 without any issues. If the FPS is low, there must be a problem with the hardware. Drivers are also crucial. E5500 CPU, dual-core, 2 threads + 4GB RAM + GTS450 can definitely handle large-scale games. Games don't consume CPU as much as you'd think; they rely more on the graphics card, memory, and hard drive. Based on some reviews, GTA4 mainly consumes CPU and memory resources. I am considering buying the GTS450 graphics card from Galaxy. As far as I know, this graphics card was produced around 2011 and has now been discontinued, so most available ones are refurbished. In this case, can GTA4 run smoothly or even perfectly with medium to high graphics settings?
I am now 180 jin (90 kg) and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles, what should I do? Especially at night, when I wake up, I just want to eat meat. I guess I can't just rely on dieting to lose weight, but need to exercise more and have a balanced diet. Even walking is tiring, let alone exercising, which may take my life. But thank you anyway.
Computer configuration: planning to get a graphics card, the GTS450 model is recommended, from the brand 'Galaxy', the price is around 400-460 RMB on Taobao. It is suggested that the GTX650 is also a good option, costing just over 600 RMB. Looking for a song, I searched on QQ Music and found "True Love Knows." Thank you for the help, but that's not the one.
Expert, please help me take a look. Can this configuration run large games (no special effects, just smooth performance) and support mold design? How much would it cost to add a graphics card? No problem, a 700-yuan graphics card should be enough, right? Can I get it for around 3,000 yuan? It's my friend's configuration, and he's also using this one.

How do I root the Samsung GT-I9128E? I've tried all sorts of one-click unlocking methods and none of them work! It's probably due to insufficient memory; try using Baidu's one-click root. That doesn't work either! The first one I tried was Baidu's. Then it must be because your memory is not enough, try changing the SD card. Is 8GB not enough? Then it must be an issue with your phone. Many phones don't work because there isn't a corresponding unlocking program developed yet. What I want to ask is which root software has developed a solution for the 9128E? If you don't know, don't say anything.
My eyeball has always been leaning against the upper eyelid, is this considered having "sanbaiyan" (a Chinese term referring to the white part of the eye being visible below the iris), and are there any disadvantages? Such beautiful eyes are myopic, I have also been paying attention to this issue for a long time, and I am nearsighted too. But some people with nearsightedness don't have eyeballs like this, are your parents like this? My parents aren't like that, but they both have double eyelids. Only my eyeball leans upwards.
I bought fake items on Le Gou online shopping platform? Can anyone tell me the phone number? Online shopping 7-day no reason return policy, 12315 complaint hotline. Are all complaint phone numbers the same? I need Le Gou's. Yes, the 12315 consumer complaint reporting hotline. You can return the goods. They don't answer the phone and don't reply to messages. They completely disappeared from me. In that case, file a complaint against them.
Please recommend well-categorized BL novels, the more the better. They can be saved on Baidu Cloud. What does BL mean? Uh, danmei.
After downloading and installing Youku, it can't play videos. What could be the reason? Youku on mobile only supports hardware decoding, and it will work if the mobile CPU supports it. It used to work before, but after I reset my phone to factory settings, it became like this. The issue could be due to different reasons in the video or computer hardware problems. For example, if you have an older computer and you want to play games, it might not work. If you want to upgrade, I suggest adding a 2GB memory stick and replacing the graphics card with a GTS450. There's no need to invest too much in the configuration.
The English translation of the Chinese sentences is: "It seems like the CPU is not powerful enough, is it necessary to change it? Your motherboard is quite old too, and it doesn't support the mainstream processors nowadays. If you want to change the processor, you'll also need to replace the motherboard. In this case, you need to replace the whole set, so you might as well build a new one from scratch. That's for system restore, please enlighten me, master. You can enter the BIOS and boot directly, and you'll see a one-click restore on the desktop. The premise is that you have a backup. The problem is that the computer won't start, so I need to restore the system."
I am currently 180 jin (about 198 lbs) and trying to lose weight, but I have cravings for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, I wake up wanting to eat meat. Am I not a man or a woman? 180? Oh my God! If you are determined, I will tell you the most scientific way. Is there any hope for boys? Yes, how tall? 175. There are three main components in the body: sugar (energy), fat (main cause of being overweight), and protein. To treat the problem, find ways to reduce body fat. There are two approaches: controlling intake and increasing consumption. If you will persist, I will tell you the specific methods. Otherwise, typing is tiring, and I don't want to waste energy.

Think about your wife seeing your big belly, and think about your lover disliking your appearance; then you will have the motivation to lose weight. I'm afraid I can't do it.
Why did I follow the prompts and enter the verification code when registering for WeChat, but it still shows verification failed? Just log in directly with your QQ number. I don't have a QQ number, and I don't know how to apply for one. Go apply for one. Asking myself, which is more effective: sitting in the office every day, drinking tea, surfing the internet, watching movies, making phone calls to connect with clients, or driving around to visit clients in person every day? The latter is obviously more effective than the former. But it costs a lot of money; I'm already 400,000 in debt with huge pressure from interest. Be willing to invest; there must be gains if you make sacrifices. Can you connect with clients by just making phone calls? There's not enough sincerity. That makes sense.
Playing League of Legends is so laggy, I don't want to admit my graphics card is too crappy. My graphics card originally had over 500 (specs/price), but it's too old now. I suggest changing it if you want to play LoL. Yeah, that jerk who repaired my computer took 100 yuan from me, and the graphics card is still second-hand. If I change to a better graphics card, will it not be laggy? It's impossible not to lag if you change to a better graphics card since your overall system configuration isn't high, but changing the graphics card will relatively improve the situation a lot. Alright then.

Why does playing LoL always cause crashes and constant virtual memory insufficiency? My hardware should be enough for playing games, and when I open web pages outside the game, the virtual memory alarm goes off, probably because the web pages take up too much memory. I've followed the steps to install and update drivers, but the problem hasn't been solved, and it's even more laggy. Update the graphics card driver, but don't choose the latest one, choose the most stable one. Why does playing LoL always cause crashes and constant virtual memory insufficiency?

Right-click on My Computer, go to Properties, Advanced, Performance Settings, and then click on Advanced. Look for virtual memory, click on Change, and set it to 1.5 times your memory size.
How is JAVA forking? Should I replace the Duke 600 with a semi-carbon or full carbon? I'm considering both but afraid of breaking the full carbon. Should I go for Shimano SLX or Deore? Can this be upgraded with a new graphics card? Your motherboard has a dedicated graphics card slot, so it can be used with a dedicated graphics card. It seems there's no slot on the graphics card. Can this be upgraded with a new graphics card? Yes, but it won't make much difference if the processor is bad, even with a good graphics card. Can I change the motherboard and graphics card together? Yes, it is recommended to change the processor as well. What kind of replacement would be better? How is the fiber optic internet charged? Our telecom offers a 20Mbps package for 1200 yuan per year.

You should consult your local county service center for more information.

Or you can do it on the computer and transfer it to your phone after it's done! Oh, okay.

The Wi-Fi shows three bars, but it can't connect to the internet. Other devices can connect just fine. Go to Wi-Fi settings and see if it's set to automatically obtain IP or DHC P.

The Wi-Fi shows three bars, but it can't connect to the internet. Other devices can connect just fine. Try restarting it. If that doesn't work, move closer to the Wi-Fi source. If it still doesn't work, try reflashing the device. I just reflashed it today. I just tried it, and the signal is full, but it still doesn't work. My Wi-Fi signal keeps dropping one bar at a time. What's going on? You can try resetting your router's Wi-Fi, which means restoring the router to its factory settings and setting up a new Wi-Fi connection. Can this really work? Sometimes the issue is with the router, but most of the time, it's not. However, right now, we can only try our best and see what happens, right? You can also try connecting to someone else's Wi-Fi and see if it works.
Who can tell me what's wrong with my tablet? The Wi-Fi has three bars, but I can't connect to the internet. Other devices can connect just fine. I can't use the browser either. The router isn't the problem since other devices work well. I'm currently replying with another device from the same brand. I'm using a YuanDao N80 and I don't have this problem. If you can connect to Wi-Fi, try restarting your device and see if that helps. Is the N12 single-core or... I'm replying to you with a YuanDao Mini One right now. Someone asked me to restart it, but it still doesn't work. I looked up the specs of the N12, and the hardware is too low-end, just like my Taipower A10T; it can't handle many games. Android hardware is updated too quickly. As hardware updates, so does the software, and low-end hardware can't keep up with new software. Your device might only be good for an MP3 player now. I've been using it for two years and have grown attached to it; I don't want to let it go. There's no other choice but to throw it away. The hardware is too low-end, but it might still be able to run some games. YuanDao is not very good; I suggest buying something else. Well, I'll think about it later; I still have a Mini One for now. ! You've reached the current usage cap for GPT-4. You can continue with the default model now, or try again after 8:40 PM.

Have you ever used the Homework Helper software? Do you think it's good or not? I feel that people inside are mostly talking about irrelevant things, and there are very few real homework questions. When I posted my own question, someone replied, "Just write it yourself." What do they mean? The homework I posted was a problem that I thought about for a long time and couldn't understand. It's not something I'm too lazy to do and want others to do for me.

It tasted a bit like an anesthetic, do you know what's going on?"
I want to buy an iPhone 4s CDMA version without a contract. Where can I buy it at the best price and ensure it's genuine? The most cost-effective option is a contract phone, but I only want the phone without a contract. Contract phones are locked. If you want the best price and a genuine product, then a contract phone is definitely the most cost-effective. China Telecom even calculates the daily cost for you. Unfortunately, it's locked. So, go to a brick-and-mortar store to buy it. The price may not be the cheapest, and you can't guarantee the authenticity of products online. Shopping has its risks. Once you get the device, you can check its usage information by the serial number.

When renovating, a cable TV wire and a red and white audio wire were buried, and the set-top box came out with red, white, and yellow, missing a yellow wire. Can I use the cable TV wire with a yellow head, and fix the connection point while I'm at it? As long as the connection points are connected well, the wire can be used, right? Yes, as long as it's the same type of wire. The wires are color-coded so that you can accurately connect both ends correctly. It's not the same type of wire! It's an old cable TV wire!

Where can I find the file after it has been restored from the recycle bin? You can download a software to recover deleted files, some of them can retrieve the files. What software? I forgot the name, it's an English name, very long. You can try searching on Baidu for "software to recover deleted files", there should be many options. If the real name and cardholder's name in NetEase Pay do not match, how can I transfer money to the card?!!?

Changing the registered name in NetEase Pay seems to be more complicated, it's better for you to contact customer service to understand the process~
How come there's no internet activity? The network cable may not be plugged in properly or the username/password is incorrect. Why can I still receive a WiFi signal then? It means the phone cannot connect to the internet. If the router has power, the phone can definitely detect the WiFi signal.

The ASUS laptop's Ethernet port is a buckle-type, and the cable is loose when connected. I need to use something to hold it in place to connect to the internet. How can I solve this? If you encounter this situation, it's possible that using a standard RJ45 cable might work. I suggest contacting ASUS support. I'm not sure if it's a standard RJ45 connector...

Can mobile phones currently crack wireless networks, and how can they do it? There is a software called Universal Unlock, which is good. Have you cracked wireless networks personally? Last October, my mom was hit by someone, and we reported it to the traffic police. When we went to mediation, the other party had already prepared a bunch of agreements waiting outside the door, and I didn't think much about it. I said we should just sue and leave. Thanks, but can the court accept the case without an accident identification form? Were the traffic police present? The traffic police were present, and there is a record of the private settlement. Otherwise, there might be a mole within the traffic police department. A lawyer will help you with this, go ahead and sue. Yes, we even went to the accident handling team. But now the traffic police say they can only return the agreement to me; they won't issue an accident identification form. Go ahead and sue. Once you do, the traffic police will have to intervene, and the responsibility will be shifted to them. Thank you, ...
What software can restrict Android phone background apps or startup programs, lock them once and prevent them from auto-starting or running in the background? Hello, you can use a phone manager like 360 Mobile Security or Tencent Mobile Manager. I am a Tencent volunteer and, to be honest, 360 is quite good. However, we have to promote our own company's software. How much is your salary? I used to work at Yixun.com, but it was too shady, so I quit. After quitting, my salary was cut in half, and Tencent can be quite ruthless. I'm sorry, but we are not allowed to discuss this in the company. As volunteers, our salaries are, of course, not the same as regular employees'.

Please tell me how to create a new file in C language using fopen (const char path, const char mode); choose mode "w" to clear the content when saving and create when saving, choose "a" to open the file in append mode for write-only, creating the file if it doesn't exist and data written will be appended to the end of the file. Isn't this about opening a file? There are only a few functions in the C standard library, and the specific functionality of fopen depends on the chosen mode, or you can use tmpfile, but this is essentially "wb+" and it is a temporary file that will be deleted automatically when the program exits. As for customer relationship management systems, try free downloads and trials. If you can't find the download location, go to Baidu search, access the website, and go to the download center to download it. Or ask customer service for the link.

Well, I'm out of ideas then.
I have already added a bank card to my Alipay. Taobao sellers say they refund the money to Alipay. What's the difference between refunding to Alipay and refunding to a bank card? When I used Alipay on my phone to make a payment and get a refund before, I could see the refund status in the purchase history of the item, such as "refund successful." If your phone is not linked, you won't receive a text message. If it is linked, you can check the purchase history to see the status, whether it's "refunding" or "refund successful." What I mean is that after the refund is successful, Alipay shows the refund has been credited, but the balance is still 0. Did you pay with Alipay or a bank card? I paid with a bank card. The seller said they would refund to my Alipay. The seller doesn't know that you paid with a bank card; generally, they assume it's through Alipay, so that's why they told you this. I can confidently say that the money was definitely refunded to your bank card. However, it might be a bit slower to get refunded to your bank card, but it should definitely be credited within one day. I have experience with this.
I have already added a bank card to my Alipay. Taobao sellers say they refund the money to Alipay. What's the difference between that and refunding it to the bank card? Why does my phone show whether the card you bound is a debit card or a credit card? If it's a credit card, the refund will be returned directly to the credit card, but it takes one or two days. If it's a debit card, you can withdraw the money from Alipay to the bound debit card, and if it's refunded, it will show as a balance in Alipay. Unless you have already withdrawn the money, the balance will still be 0. You should have received a refund of 8 yuan, and then you charged 10 yuan for your phone bill. In reality, you only paid 2 yuan, so the 8 yuan refund was used for your phone bill. No, the balance of 10 yuan in the payment details is the 8 yuan refunded by the seller. I'll try transferring two yuan myself. But the account balance is 0. Could it be in Yu'e Bao? The balance in Yu'e Bao account is 0. I don't know then; your phone may not have reflected the change. I have already added a bank card to my Alipay. Taobao sellers say they refund the money to Alipay. What's the difference between that and refunding it to the bank card? Why does my phone show this? It depends on the seller's situation. They will do whichever is more convenient! The seller said that they have refunded the money to Alipay, and I can see the added amount in Alipay. Yes, this is normal. As long as the money is refunded to you, the next time you shop on Taobao, you can use this amount even if it's not enough, and it can be automatically combined with other bound bank cards for payment. It doesn't affect anything. I still don't quite understand... Can you explain it in simpler terms from the beginning? Haha. The next time you shop on Taobao, the Taobao system will automatically prompt you that this money can be used. But there was no prompt. I didn't get this prompt when I bought something later. If you install the Taobao app on your phone, you will get the prompt, and you can use the quick payment method. The prompt should definitely be visible. I have already added a bank card to my Alipay. Taobao sellers say they refund the money to Alipay. What's the difference between that and refunding it to the bank card? Why does my phone show this? If you paid with your card, the refund will go to your card! The refund will only go to your Alipay if you paid with your Alipay balance! I paid with online banking. What's the deal with the money being sent to Alipay? Have you checked your card? The card doesn't show anything. It takes one or two days for the money to arrive. Have you bound the card? Yes, I have. Don't worry, the refund will be sent to your card! My current problem is that there's no refund in the card and the Alipay balance also shows 0, but the payment details show that I have received a refund.
Working away from home. Today is my birthday, and my phone is turned off. I don't want to tell my friends, and I don't want to be ignored. I bought a cake to celebrate by myself! Netizens, please send me some blessings! Happy birthday! Thank you!
I am currently 180 jin (approximately 90 kg) and trying to lose weight, but I have a craving for braised pork and instant noodles. What should I do? Especially at night, I wake up wanting to eat meat. Am I hopeless? What can I do? Playing on the computer or phone to distract myself – I do that every day, eating while playing. You're awesome.
