In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province from a real estate agent. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase with Lin, a family member of the property owner, and paid a deposit of RMB 200,000 through a bank transfer on the same day. Lin signed as the recipient of the deposit on the "Receipt for the Sale of Factory Deposit," which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will belong to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice. The two parties agreed to sign the factory sale contract within one week." However, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on major contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment method, resulting in a delay in the signing of the property sale contract. A few days later, Lin returned the deposit to Mr. Lu, considering that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contract content. Mr. Lu, who had finally found a house, paid the deposit, and prepared the house payment, was left helpless and angry when the seller refused to sell the property just before the contract was signed. As a result, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao People's Court. The court held that the failure to sign a formal contract could not be solely attributed to the defendant and should be reasonably presumed as failed negotiations. Therefore, the penalty provisions for the deposit should not apply, and the defendant should not bear the breach of contract liability of returning double the deposit. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the second-instance court upheld the original judgment. [Lawyer Reminder] It is necessary to exercise due diligence during the transaction process. As a buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner and whether the property is occupied, when signing the contract. It is also important to specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between both parties during contract performance.
