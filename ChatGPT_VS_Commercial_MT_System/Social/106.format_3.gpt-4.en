In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Zhating Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a housing agency. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase with the family member of the property owner, Mr. Lin, and transferred a deposit of 200,000 RMB via bank transfer on the same day. Mr. Lin signed the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt" as the payee, which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase contract within a week." However, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the major contract terms, such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, resulting in the housing sale contract not being signed. Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 RMB deposit to Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu, who had finally found a property he liked, paid the deposit and prepared the payment, was left both frustrated and angry when the seller refused to sell at the last moment. As a result, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin in the Yuyao People's Court. The court found that both parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and the responsibility could not be solely attributed to the defendant. It was reasonably inferred that the negotiations were unsuccessful, so the deposit penalty rule should not apply in this case, and the defendant was not required to bear the breach of contract responsibility of returning double the deposit. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment. [Lawyer's Reminder] In the transaction process, it is essential to exercise necessary due diligence. When signing a contract, the buyer should fulfill their necessary duty of care, such as verifying the property owner's information, whether the property is occupied by others, and other relevant information. Additionally, it is important to specify the exact time and location of the property handover in the contract to prevent disputes between both parties during the contract execution.
