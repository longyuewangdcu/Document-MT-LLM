In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing agency about a plant located in the town of Zhejiang Yuyao zhangting, and after several site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu on the details of the purchase of the plant and the family of the owner of the house Linmou after consultation, on the same day by bank transfer remittance of 200,000 yuan for the deposit. Linmou in the "plant sale deposit receipt" as the payee signature, which contains, "If the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this deposit to the seller, such as the seller is not willing to sell this plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, the two sides agreed to sign the plant sale contract within a week." However, after the two sides failed to form a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of plant sales, payment methods, resulting in the delay in the signing of the contract for the sale of housing. Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu. It is easy to look at the house, the deposit paid, the house is also ready, just "a foot in the door" to sign the contract, the seller is not sold, which makes Mr. Lu helpless and angry. For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court. The court heard that the parties eventually failed to sign a formal contract, can not be attributed to the defendant alone, should be reasonably presumed to negotiate, so the case should not apply the deposit penalty, the defendant does not need to bear double the return of the deposit for breach of contract liability. After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal. Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict. 【Lawyer reminder】 Do the necessary prudent attention in the transaction process. When signing the contract, as a buyer to do the necessary prudent attention obligations, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other related information, and in the contract clearly about the specific time and place of delivery, to prevent disputes between the two sides when performing the contract.
