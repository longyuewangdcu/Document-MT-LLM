In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a house intermediary that a factory building in Zhenting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province. After watching the house on the spot, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant.	 In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, the family members of the owner of the house, and the house owner's family member Lin made a final deposit of 200,000 yuan on the same day.	 Lin signed as the payee in the "Power Building of Factory Building Trading", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this deposit is returned to the seller.	 It is agreed that the signing and selling contract of the factory building will be signed within a week. "However, after that, the two parties failed to form a consistent opinion due to the fact that the main contracts such as the sale of the plant and the payment method, which caused the house sales contract to be delayed.	 Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.	 The house that was hard to see, the deposit was paid, and the house was ready. The "Linking door" signed the contract, but the seller did not sell it. This made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.	 To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao People's Court.	 According to the trial, the two sides failed to sign a formal contract and could not only be attributed to the defendant. They should be reasonably preserved as a negotiation. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied to the case.	 After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed.	 Recently, the court of the second instance maintained the original sentence. [Lawyer Reminder] During the transaction, we must do our best to pay attention to the obligations of cautious attention.	 When signing the contract, as a buyer, you must fulfill your cautious attention obligations. For example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by the house, and the specific time and place of the delivery in the contract to prevent fulfilling the contract to prevent the contract from fulfilling the contract to prevent the contract from fulfilling the contract	 At that time, the two sides were controversial.
