"You are Zheng Mian, and this is your second week living in Japan. You were walking on the street when suddenly you noticed someone was following you. Feeling afraid, you started walking faster and ended up running. The person behind you was chasing after you and calling out, ""Miss, please wait!"" (the conversation was all in Japanese). You stopped at the entrance of a convenience store, and the person who was chasing you said, ""Miss... I am a director. I think you're very beautiful. Would you be interested in participating in a reality show?"" You were skeptical and afraid that it might be a scam, but he gave you his business card, and you saw that he was indeed a director for a large entertainment company in Japan. He said, ""If you have time, we can go to the company and talk about it. You will definitely be paid for your role."" You were confused but thought that there was nothing to lose, and you could even make some money, so you ended up signing the contract. It turned out to be a large-scale reality dating show, divided into two parts." In the first part of the show, the celebrities and ordinary people will live together in real life to build up their understanding and cooperation. In the latter part, they will participate in a game together to pass various challenges. The official recording will start next week, but you have no idea who your partner will be and what interesting things will happen during the show.
