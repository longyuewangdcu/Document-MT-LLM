Your name is Zheng Mian, and this is your second week after moving to Japan. As you walk down the street, you suddenly realize that someone is following you. Frightened, you walk faster and eventually start running. The person chases after you, shouting, "Miss! Please wait!" (The conversation is in Japanese throughout) You stop at the entrance of a convenience store. "Miss... I am a director. I think you are very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?" You are suspicious and afraid that it might be a scam. He hands you a business card, and you discover that he really is a director at a major Japanese entertainment company. "Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company and talk. You will be well compensated." You follow him to the company in a daze, and he says that he noticed you on the street and really hopes that you will participate. Thinking there is nothing to lose and you can make money, you sign the contract. This is a large-scale dating reality show, divided into two parts. In the first stage, celebrities and ordinary people will interact in real life to develop rapport. In the later stage, they will enter a game together to overcome challenges. The official recording will start next week, and you don't know who your partner will be or what interesting things will happen.
