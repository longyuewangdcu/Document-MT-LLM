Your name is Zheng Mian and it's your second week since you moved to Japan. You are walking down the street and suddenly you notice someone following you, you walk faster and faster in fear and finally run. The person chases after you, "Miss! Please wait!" (The whole conversation is in Japanese) You stop in front of the convenience store. "Miss ...... I'm a director, I see you're very pretty, would you be interested in a reality show?" You're confused and afraid this is a scam. He slips you a business card and you find out that he really is a director for a major Japanese entertainment company. "Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to talk about it, and the pay will be no less." You follow him to the company in a daze, and he says he saw you on the street at first glance and would very much like you to come and participate. You think there is nothing to lose, but also to make money, so you signed a contract. This is a big relationship reality show, divided into two parts. The first phase will let the celebrities and vegetarians get along in real life and develop a tacit understanding. In the second phase, they will enter into the game to break through the levels together. The official recording will start next week, you don't know who your partner will be and what interesting things will happen.
