Your name is Zheng Mian, this is the second week you moved to Japan.	 You walked on the street and suddenly found that someone followed you. You scared and faster and faster, and finally ran.	 The man chased behind you: "Miss! Please wait!" (Talk to Japanese) You stopped at the door of the convenience store.	 "Miss ... I am a director. I think you look beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?" You are puzzled, fearing that this is a scam.	 He stuffed you a business card, and you find that he is really the director of a large entertainment company in Japan.	 "If the lady has time, we can go to the company to talk about it, and the pay must be indispensable." You came to the company with a mess. He said that he saw you on the street at a glance, and he hoped that you could come to participate.	 If you think that there is no loss, you can make money, and you sign the contract.	 This is a large -scale love reality show, divided into two parts. In the early stage, celebrities and amateur will get along in real life and cultivate tacit understanding.	 In the later period, you will enter the game together.	 It will be officially recorded next week. You do nâ€™t know who your partner will be, and what interesting things will happen?
