Your name is Zheng Mian. It's your second week in Japan. You're walking down the street and suddenly you realize someone is following you. You walk faster and faster in fear and finally run. The person chases after you:" Miss! Please wait! "You stop in front of a convenience store."Miss ... I'm a director, and I think you're beautiful. Would you be interested in a reality show?" You're confused, afraid it's a scam. He gives you a business card, and you find out he's really a director for a big Japan entertainment company."Miss, if you have time, we can talk at the company. We'll definitely get paid." You're confused and follow him to the company.He said he saw you on the street and he really wanted you to come. You thought you had nothing to lose and you could make money, so you signed the contract. It was a big reality show about love, divided into two parts. In the early stage, the stars and amateurs will get along in real life and develop a tacit understanding. Later, they will enter the game to jointly break through. The official recording will begin next week. You don't know who your partner will be. What interesting things will happen?
