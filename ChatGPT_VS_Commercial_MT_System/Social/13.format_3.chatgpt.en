First of all, let me state my conclusion: personally, I think "Four Seas" is a completely bad movie in every sense. However, if you ask whether this movie has any highlights, it's not completely true - at least the soundtrack is well chosen. There are many types of bad movies. One type is the kind that makes you fall asleep in the cinema, and another type is the kind that makes you indignant after watching it. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience - it can ignite your anger in countless ways. Han Han is really talented in insulting the audience. The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a sci-fi novel that is difficult to describe and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Xiao Ma Ge's body. After watching it, you will even doubt whether there are hidden metaphors implied by the director, but after careful consideration, you will find that it is just a piece of shit. Let me briefly describe some of the plot points that I find hard to understand. The protagonist lives on a small island in the south with his grandmother, and her wish is to see snow. Then the plot arranges for an old man from the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see snow. An elderly person sitting in a bread van from the south to the northeast to see snow?? He and his father are still very confident about this. Then the old man had nothing more to say. How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship? How could the street racing gang easily close off a section of mountain road? Then a truck carrying steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't be found around. The prop feeling is too obvious. Why would a small-time gang member with bad credit and suspected of illegal activities become an auxiliary police officer? Why didn't they report to the police about the high-interest loans, and the police in the movie even asked if they were in trouble? An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, and is forced to sleep outside the room because they can't find the hotel owner? These inexplicable plots are rampant throughout the film. Because the plots are too absurd, they even make me feel painful when I recall them. Apart from the plot, what's worse about the movie is its theme, or rather, the movie doesn't have a theme at all. It's an ugly patchwork of different elements. At the beginning of the movie, you might think it's a comedy, but after 20 minutes, you might guess it's an inspirational movie. Halfway through, you might think it's a drama about the struggles of small-town youth. But after you finish watching it, you have no idea what you just watched. This leads to deep self-doubt and makes you wonder why you spent your New Year's Day watching such a terrible movie. Most people are familiar with the formula for making various types of movies. If you want to make a movie about a motorcycle racer, for example, you need inspiration and comedy, and you need to show the audience how a talented rookie overcomes obstacles to succeed. If you want to make a romantic movie, you should honestly tell the story of the love and hatred between a motorcycle-riding small-town youth and a waitress. If you want to reflect reality, at least the plot cannot contradict the normal world. (For example, the character played by Yin Zheng just burned his new motorcycle, but can still sing.) You cannot create some mind-boggling nonsense. I don't know if the female lead's childish behavior is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements. Also, I'm confused as to why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen on adding car crashes to his own movies. Is this movie being released during the Spring Festival just to annoy the audience?
