To state the conclusion first, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a terrible film in every sense of the word. However, if you were to say that this movie has absolutely no highlights, that would not be true either, as at least the soundtrack is quite good. There are many types of bad movies: ones that can put you to sleep in the theater, and ones that leave you filled with righteous indignation after watching them. For the audience, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei that can ignite your anger in countless ways. When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted. The most painful aspect of this film is that it seems like a creation from a horrible novel, indescribable and full of holes, just like the trench coat on Little Marco. After watching it, you may even wonder if there are hidden metaphors implied by the director, but upon careful reflection, you'll find it's actually just a pile of crap. Let's start with a simple... He and his father were very confident about it. Then the story of the old man just ended there. How did the female lead's brother obtain a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship? How could the motorcycle gang on the island easily block off a mountain road? And then there's a truck delivering steel bars parked on the side of the road, with no driver to be found anywhere. The prop placement is just too obvious. Why would a person with bad credit and suspected illegal activities in a motorcycle gang become an auxiliary police officer? Why not call the police when facing loan sharks, especially when the police in the movie specifically asked if there were any difficulties? An adult who knows how to use a smartphone doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to not find the hotel owner, sleeping outside the room for the night? These inexplicable plots are scattered throughout the film, and recalling them is painful due to their absurdity. Besides the plot, what's even worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, the lack of one. It's just a hideous patchwork monster. At the beginning of the film, you might think it's a comedy; 20 minutes later, you might guess it's an inspirational film; halfway through, you may think it's a drama depicting the struggles of small-town youths. After watching it, you have no idea what you've just seen, which is followed by deep self-doubt, questioning why you went to the cinema to watch crap during the holidays. Most people are actually very familiar with various movie formulas. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle racer, you can combine inspiration and comedy and show the audience how a talented rookie gradually achieves success. If you want to make a romance film, just honestly tell the story of the love and grudges between a motorcycle-loving small-town youth and a waitress. If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot shouldn't contain elements contrary to the normal world (such as the character played by Yin Zheng, whose new motorcycle was just burned but could still sing). You shouldn't create plot holes that even Kennedy can't stand. As for the female lead, who is clearly not intellectually disabled but acts like a 5-year-old in some aspects, I don't know if it's due to her acting or the director's request. Another point I don't understand is why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies. Is the arrangement of such a movie during the Spring Festival to annoy the audience?
