To start with the conclusion, I personally think "Four Seas" is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word. But you have to say that the film is not a highlight, it is not at least the soundtrack is well chosen. There are many kinds of bad movies, those that make you sleep soundly in the cinema, and those that make you feel angry after watching them. In insulting the audience, Han Han is really gifted. The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creation from a gram-novel, unnamable, with as many holes as a trench coat on a pony. Even after watching it you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director in it, but when you think about it carefully you find it is actually a piece of shit. First of all, I'd like to briefly mention some of the plot points that I have a hard time understanding. The main character lives on an island in the south, and his grandmother is dependent on him. Her grandmother has a wish to see snow, and then the plot is arranged in the neighborhood of a grandfather driving a minivan to send her to the northeast to see the snow. Senior citizen in a van from the south to the northeast to see snow? He and his dad were still very relieved about it. Then the old man didn't follow. In the abandoned ship to open a hotel, the heroine his brother how to get a business license? Why can the island biker party punks easily do a section of the mountain road to close the road? Then the middle of the road to send rebar trucks parked on the side of the road, surrounded by even truck drivers can not find. This sense of prop is too obvious, right? A credit can not and suspected of breaking the law of the punk flyers why will become an auxiliary police? In the face of loan sharks why not call the police, the film police also specifically asked whether there is a difficult situation? An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to use the room card to open the door in the hotel, and then forcefully arranged to find the hotel owner, sitting outside the room door to sleep overnight? This kind of inexplicable plot is filled throughout the film, and because the plot is so outrageous that it pains me to recall them. In addition to the plot, what is worse is the main idea of the movie, or rather the movie has no main idea at all, it is a stitching monster with an abominable face. The beginning of the film you will think he wanted to make a comedy film, after 20 minutes or so you guess it may be an inspirational film, watch half of it you think it may be a drama to reflect the survival of small town youth is not easy, after watching you do not know what they actually watched, followed by deep suspicion of their own, the New Year's why to run to the cinema to enjoy the poop. For most people are actually very familiar with all kinds of film formula, such as you want to shoot motorcyclists, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie step by step to success. If you want to make a romance, then you can honestly talk about the feud between a small town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress girl. If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot should not appear to be contrary to the normal world. (For example, Yin Zheng played the role of the new motorcycle just burned, and then can still sing), you can not go to open some even JFK looked at the brain hole can not be. As for the female lead is obviously not retarded but in some ways behaves like a 5 year old, I really don't know if this is due to acting or the director's requirements. There is one more thing I don't understand, Han Han as a race car driver why he is so keen to add crash scenarios in his own movies? This kind of movie is scheduled in the Spring Festival, is it to add to the audience?
