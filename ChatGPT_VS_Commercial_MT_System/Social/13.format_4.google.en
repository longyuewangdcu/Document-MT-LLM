Let's talk about the conclusion first. I personally think that "Four Seas" is a comprehensive rotten movie, which is in various senses.	 But you have to say whether this movie is not a highlight, and it is not at least good.	 There are many kinds of bad movies, so that you can fall asleep in the cinema, so that you can fill it up after watching it. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience.	 Methods to ignite your anger.	 In insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.	 The most painful thing in this film is that it seems to be a creature in the novels. It is difficult to famous. There are many vulnerabilities like a trench coat on Xiaoma.	 After reading it, you will doubt whether there is a metaphor that the director is implied, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is actually a shit.	 Let me simply talk about some of the plots that I have difficulty in understanding.	 The place of the male lead should be on a small island on the south, depending on his grandma.	 Her grandma had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged a uncle in the neighborhood to drive her small van to send her to the northeast to see the snow.	 Elderly people sitting from the south to the northeast of the elderly?	 Intersection He and his father were still very assured of this.	 Then the old man was not following.	 Opening a hotel on the abandoned ship, how did the hostess get the business license?	 Why can the speeding party on the island be easily sealed by a section of mountain roads?	 Intersection	 Then the truck with a reinforcement in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even a truck driver could not be found around.	 This item is too obvious.	 Why does a small mixed Speed Party who is not suspected of credit reporting and suspected of being illegal?	 Why not call the police in the face of usury, the police in the movie also asked if there was any difficulty?	 An adult knows how to use smartphones, but does not know how to open the door with a room card in the hotel, and then forcibly arrange to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room door to sleep?	 This inexplicable plot is filled with the entire film, because the plot is too outrageous that I will feel pain when I remember them. In addition to the plot, the worse thing is the main purpose of the movie, or that the movie has no theme at all, it is an abominable suture monster.	 At the beginning of the film, you will think he wants to make a comedy film. After more than 20 minutes, you guess it may be a inspirational film. When you watch half of it, you think it may be a plot movie that wants to reflect that the youth of the town is not easy.	 I don't know what I watched, followed by deep doubts about myself, why do I go to the cinema to enjoy the stool.	 For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle, you are inspirational + comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie is successful step by step.	 If you want to make a love movie, then you honestly talk about the grievances between young people who like to ride motorcycles and waiter girls.	 If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot appear something contrary to the normal world.	 (For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zhengyan was just burned, and then the role of singing), you can't open some brains that can't even see Kennedy.	 As for the heroine's obviously not mentally handicapped, it can perform like a 5 -year -old child in some ways. I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the director's request.	 One more thing I don't want to understand, why is Han Han who is so keen to add a collision plot in his own movie as a racer?	 Such a movie is arranged in the Spring Festival. Is it to add to the audience?
