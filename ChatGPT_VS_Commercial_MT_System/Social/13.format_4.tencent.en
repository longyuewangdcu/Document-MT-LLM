First, let's talk about the conclusion. Personally, I think "Four Seas" is a bad movie in all aspects, in all senses. However, if you want to say whether this movie has no bright spots, it's not that at least the soundtrack is well chosen. There are many kinds of bad movies. One can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and the other can make you feel indignant after watching it. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience.It can ignite your anger in a myriad of ways. Han has a talent for insulting audiences. The most painful thing about this film is that it feels like a creature from a Kirk novel. It's hard to describe, and it's as flawed as a trench coat on a pony. You might even wonder if there's a director's hidden metaphor after watching it.But when you think about it, it's actually a piece of shit. Let's briefly talk about some of the plots that I find difficult to understand. The main character should live on a small island in the south, and his grandmother is dependent on each other. Her grandmother has a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranges for an old man in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow in a minivan. The old man sits in a minivan from the south to the northeast to see the snow?? He and his father were very relieved about this. Then the old man did not follow up. How did the female lead's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship? How could the small gangsters of the island's motorcycle gang easily block a section of mountain road?? Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road stopped by the roadside.We couldn't even find a truck driver in the surrounding area. The feeling of props was too obvious. Why would a gangster who had bad credit and was suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary police officer? Why didn't he call the police when faced with loan sharks? In the movie, the police even specifically asked if there was any difficulty? An adult who knows how to use a smart phone, but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcibly arranged that he couldn't find the hotel owner.Sat out the door for a night? This kind of inexplicable plot fills the entire film, and the plot is so outrageous that it makes me feel painful when I recall it. Besides the plot, what 's worse is the theme of the movie, or the movie has no theme at all. It' s just a hideous stitching monster. At the beginning of the movie, you think he wants to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you guess it 's probably an inspirational movie. Halfway through, you think it' s probably a drama that wants to show the hard-earned survival of young people in small towns. After watching it, you don't know what you have seen at all. What follows is a deep doubt about yourself.Why go to the cinema to enjoy poop on New Year 's Eve? For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routine of various movies. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle rider, then inspirational + comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie has become successful step by step. If you want to make a romance, then you should honestly talk about the grievances between the small town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and the waitress. If you want to reflect reality,At the very least, your plot can't have anything that goes against the normal world.(For example, the character who can sing after his new motorcycle has just been burned), he can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand. As for the female lead who is obviously not retarded but acts like a 5-year-old child in some ways, I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the director 's request. There is another point I don't quite understand.Why is Han Han, a racing driver, so keen to add a car crash to his own movie? Is such a movie scheduled for the Spring Festival to add to the audience?
