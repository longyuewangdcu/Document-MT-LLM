I accidentally came across the following article, which discusses from a business perspective and a preservation period perspective why this customer wants the logistics company inside the bonded zone to help with the canning, even though canning is considered deep processing and not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this. I have visited many milk powder manufacturers and have been in contact with many milk powder production lines. In fact, the raw materials for bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference. So you may ask: why does bagged milk powder have a shelf life of one year, while canned milk powder has a shelf life of two years or more? Or why is there such a big price difference between canned and bagged milk powder? In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or moms, think that the quality of canned milk powder is better because the raw materials are different. In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people think that the more expensive one is better. Some consumers even have a mindset that after eating canned milk powder, they claim that the taste is different! Now let me first explain why canned milk powder is more expensive, what makes it expensive? And why is there such a big price difference when the raw materials are the same? Most manufacturers consider that if the price of bagged milk powder is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is low or even non-existent. Then, how can the manufacturer survive? Therefore, they have a significant increase in pricing for canned milk powder to ensure their profit margins. As a result, most manufacturers promote canned milk powder instead of bagged milk powder. Also, many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even billions of yuan on advertising every year. Where does this cost come from? You can imagine. With the development of society, the cost of marketing, such as promotion personnel in shopping malls, display costs, product gifts, advertising costs, etc., is increasing. Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, mainly canned milk powder, with prices continuously rising, which is actually a new product that emerges as market costs increase. The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, and the cost increase for raw materials is generally no more than 3 or 4 yuan. Additionally, some brands use any means to promote their products, even colluding with doctors in hospitals to assist in product promotion, and they can make a profit of 30 to 80 yuan per can. However, this kind of operation is absolutely not allowed under Chinese law, and it is actually harming consumers. It is recommended that people buy bagged milk powder and pour it into a can at home, which can save costs and increase the storage and sealing of the milk powder without any impact on children. Also, do not think that the shelf life of canned milk powder is shorter than that of the boxed one. After opening the package, the shelf life of boxed and canned milk powder is the same. The difference is that boxed milk powder is not easy to store and can easily become damp and deteriorate."
