I accidentally came across the following article, which discusses from a business perspective and a preservation period perspective why this client wants a logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning, even though canning is considered deep processing and does not belong to the scope of business of bonded logistics companies. This article may be able to explain why the client wants to do this. I have visited many milk powder factories and have been exposed to many milk powder production lines. In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference at all. People would definitely ask: Why does bagged milk powder have a shelf life of one year, while canned milk powder has a shelf life of two years or longer? Or they might ask: Why is there such a big price difference between canned and bagged milk powder? Many consumers, or mothers, actually think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality is much better. In reality, the raw materials are the same, but people just believe that more expensive means better. Some consumers even have this mentality and say that the taste or flavor of canned milk powder is different after trying it! Now, let me first tell you the reason why canned milk powder is more expensive, where the cost comes from, and why there is such a big price difference with the same raw materials. When manufacturers set prices, most of them take into consideration that if the price of bagged milk powder is set too high, consumers will have difficulty accepting it. This means that the manufacturers' profits will be very low or even non-existent. So, how can they survive? As a result, they have a significant increase in the pricing of canned milk powder to ensure their profit margin. Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote canned milk powder rather than bagged milk powder. Moreover, you may consider the advertising expenses of so many manufacturers, which amount to tens of millions or even billions every year. Where does this money come from? It's easy to imagine. As society develops, market promotion costs, such as those for salespeople in shopping malls, display expenses, product giveaways, and advertising fees, are constantly increasing. So, manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, particularly canned milk powder, and their prices are also continuously rising. In fact, these new products are introduced as market costs increase. The main goal is to achieve higher profits, while the actual increase in raw material costs will not exceed 3 to 4 yuan at most. Furthermore, some brands resort to unscrupulous means to promote their products, such as collaborating with doctors in hospitals to help promote their products and making profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per can. Chinese laws strictly forbid such practices, and in fact, these methods are harming consumers. I suggest that if you have cans at home, you can buy bagged milk powder and transfer it into the cans. This way, you can save costs while increasing the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without causing any impact on the children. Also, don't assume that the shelf life of canned milk powder is longer than that of bagged milk powder. After opening, the shelf life of both canned and bagged milk powder is the same. It's just that bagged milk powder is not as easy to store after opening and is more susceptible to moisture and spoilage.
