I accidentally saw the following article, from the perspective of business and shelf life, why the customer wanted the logistics company inside the bonded zone to help do the canning, although the canning belongs to the deep processing, does not belong to the scope of business of bonded logistics companies, here the following text may explain why the customer wanted to do so? I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines. In fact, the raw materials of the milk powder in bags and listened to are exactly the same, there is no difference between them. Then people will surely ask: Why is the shelf life of the bagged milk powder one year, while the shelf life of the listened milk powder is two years or longer? Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big? In fact, from this point on many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different so the quality will be much better. In fact, the raw materials are the same, but we think the expensive is good. There are also consumers out of this mindset after eating the reaction also said listen to the taste or flavor is not the same! Now I'll talk to you first about the reason for listening to the expensive, expensive where? They are the same raw materials why the price difference is so big? Because most of the manufacturers in the pricing time to consider if the bag pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that manufacturers generate very low profits, or no profit, then manufacturers rely on what to survive? So they have a large increase in the pricing of listening to the package to protect their profit margin. Therefore most manufacturers are mainly pushing the listened to, rather than bagged. There are so many manufacturers you want to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year on advertising, the cost of where? We can imagine. Then with the development of society, the market promotion costs, such as: shopping mall promoters, shopping mall display costs, product giveaway costs, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing. So various manufacturers are also increasing the new products, and is listening to the suit, its price is also rising, in fact, this is with the increase in market costs out of the new products. The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials to increase the cost of up to no more than 3, 4 yuan. There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, by any means, linked with the hospital doctors, they assist in the promotion of the product, from a hear inside the profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan. The relevant Chinese laws absolutely do not allow such a method of operation, in fact, this practice is to harm consumers. It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder in cans at home on the premise that this can save money, while increasing the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and there is no effect on small children. There are also people who do not think that the shelf life of listening to the bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of listening to the bag and the bag is the same after opening the bag, only that the bag is not easy to save after opening the bag, easy to moisture deterioration.
