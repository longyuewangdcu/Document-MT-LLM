I accidentally saw the following article. From the perspective of business and the perspective of the preservation period, why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help can be canned.	 This text may explain why customers want to do this?	 I go to many manufacturers of milk powder and come into contact with many milk powder production lines.	 In fact, bags are exactly the same as that of listening milk powder. There is no difference.	 Then everyone will definitely ask: Why is the shelf life of the bag in one year, and the shelf life of listening is two years or longer?	 Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bags?	 In fact, many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different, it will be much better.	 In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks it is good.	 There are also consumers who have eaten this mentality and reacted and said that the taste or taste of listening to pretend is different!	 Now I will tell you the reason why you listen to your expensive. Where is the expensive?	 Why are their raw materials the same difference? Because most of the manufacturers take into account that if the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit. So what does the manufacturer depend on to survive?	 Therefore, in the pricing of hearing, they have a large rise to ensure their profit margins.	 Therefore, most manufacturers push listening, not bags.	 And you think so many manufacturers have tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising costs each year. Why does this cost come?	 Everyone can imagine.	 So with the development of society, the market promotion costs, such as the promoters of the mall, the display costs of the mall, the cost of the product, and the advertising costs, etc., are also increasing.	 Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and they are listening, and their prices are constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that increases with market costs.	 The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increase in their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan.	 There are also some brands. In order to promote their own products, they do not choose to link with the hospital doctors. They assist the promotion of the product and draw profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan.	 The relevant laws in China are absolutely not allowed to be allowed to operate and methods. In fact, this approach is to harm consumers. It is recommended that you buy a bag of milk powder into the can under the premise that you have a can at home. This can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder without any impact on children.	 There are also everyone don't think that the shelf life of listening is longer than the bag. If the shelf life of listening to the bag after the bag is opened, it is just that the bag is not easy to save after the bag is opened, and it is easy to be metamorphic.
