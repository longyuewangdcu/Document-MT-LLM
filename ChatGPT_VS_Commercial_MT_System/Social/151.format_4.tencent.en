I accidentally saw the following article, from the commercial point of view and the perspective of the shelf life, why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning, although canning belongs to deep processing and does not belong to the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text here may explain why the customer wants to do so? I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines. In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same.It doesn't make any difference. So people are going to ask:Why is the shelf life of the bag one year, and the shelf life of the can is two years or more? Or ask:Why is the price difference between canned and bagged products so big? In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better. In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that the expensive one is good. There are also consumers out of this mentality who even said that the taste or taste of canned products is different! Now I will tell you why canned products are expensive.Why is the price difference so big? They have the same raw materials. Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it. This means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit. What does the manufacturer rely on to survive? So they have a large increase in the price of the can to protect their profit margins. Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote the can.Instead of bags. And you think so many manufacturers every year advertising costs tens of millions or even hundreds of millions, this cost? We can imagine. So with the development of society, the market promotion costs, such as:Shopping mall sales promotion personnel, shopping mall display costs, product gifts costs, advertising costs are also constantly increasing. So each manufacturer is also constantly increasing new products, but also canned, its price is constantly rising, in fact, this is with the increase in market costs and new products. The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials increase the cost of no more than 3, 4 yuan. There are some brands, in order to promote their products,By hook or crook, linked with the hospital doctor, by their help product promotion, from a listen to which draw into 30 yuan to 80 yuan of profit. And China's relevant laws are absolutely not allowed to such a way of operation, in fact, this approach is in the trap of consumers. It is recommended that you have cans at home under the premise of buying bags of milk powder into the cans, so that you can save money, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and there is no impact on children. There are people do not think that the shelf life of canned is longer than the bag, if you open the bag after the canned and bagged shelf life is the same, just that the bag is not easy to save after opening the bag, easy to damp deterioration.
