I just read an article about menstruation, but it was too long. Let me give a quick introduction to male readers who may not know about it. Most girls will experience their first period, or menstruation, at some point between the ages of 13-15, and will stop having periods around the age of 50. After the first period, assuming good health, menstruation will occur approximately once a month, but it's not regular enough to predict precisely, with a margin of error of about a week or so. Preparation is needed, and sometimes even with good luck, things can go wrong (e.g., starting several days earlier than expected). The duration, volume, and level of pain experienced during menstruation vary from person to person. Some people experience three days of menstruation, while others may have it for a week; some people have a light flow, while others experience heavy bleeding. Some people experience no discomfort, while others experience such severe pain that they need to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. The level of pain experienced can also change over time. Just because someone did not experience pain in the past doesn't mean they won't experience pain in the future. Menstruation cannot be controlled, and during the several days from the beginning to the end of the period, blood will flow for 24 hours a day. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to prevent blood from staining clothing or furniture. The main cause of menstrual pain is the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen as soon as possible when menstruation starts can effectively relieve pain for the current month, but it won't help much if taken after the pain has started. Before menstruation, due to increased blood flow to the uterus and excessive release of prostaglandins, some people may experience diarrhea. If diarrhea occurs at about the expected time in the menstrual cycle, it usually means that menstruation is coming within the next two days. Sanitary pads should be changed every two to three hours to prevent the growth of bacteria. Excluding sleeping hours, the worst-case scenario would be to change pads six times a day, for seven days a month, which equals 42 pads. If someone prepares ahead of time, they may need up to 50 pads, but it doesn't mean they will use one pad every month. (Note: tampons do not need to be changed as frequently, as they can be worn for about five to six hours, with a maximum of eight hours.) Hormones during menstruation can make someone irritable, and hormones during ovulation can cause emotional instability. It's just unlucky that the body can work against itself. However, official crime rate data shows that women are still capable of controlling their emotions, and they won't use emotional issues as an excuse. Menstruation is not just about bleeding; it also involves shedding the uterine lining. After menstruation ends, the uterine lining is at its thinnest and gradually thickens. It's like building a house every month to prepare for a guest who never arrives, and then tearing it down (menstruation) to build a new one the next month. Menstruation is very inconvenient, with 24-hour bleeding for several days every month for decades, along with abdominal and back pain. Who would willingly choose this? However, the fact that people can be born is due to their mothers' menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you come into this world. Everyone should be grateful for their mother's regular and healthy menstruation. In the past, many things related to women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into thinking that menstruation was dirty and shameful. People used to believe this, but times have changed. If someone finds menstruation disgusting or thinks that the female body's preparation for carrying life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it publicly. Girls, stand up for yourselves and don't let people think" Lastly, sisters, give menstrual cups a try, they are really useful.
