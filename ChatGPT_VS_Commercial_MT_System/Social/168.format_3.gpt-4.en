I just saw a lengthy article about menstruation, which I'll briefly explain for men who may not be familiar with the topic. Most girls will experience their first menstruation suddenly between the ages of 13 and 15, and it usually stops around the age of 50. Under the premise of good health, menstruation will generally occur once a month. However, it's not regular enough to predict precisely, with a margin of error of about a week, so preparations need to be made in advance. Sometimes, if luck is not on your side, it may start several days earlier than expected. The duration, blood flow, and pain levels during menstruation vary from person to person. Some people may have a period lasting three days, while others may have it for a week. Some individuals may have lighter flows, while others may experience heavy bleeding. Some people may not feel any discomfort, while others may suffer severe pain that requires medical attention. Painful periods can change over time, so not experiencing pain in the past does not guarantee a pain-free experience for life. Menstrual bleeding is uncontrollable and lasts 24 hours a day for several days from start to finish. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from staining clothes and chairs. Menstrual pain is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen as soon as the period starts and before the pain sets in can effectively alleviate the pain for that month. Taking pain relief medication after the pain has already started is less effective. Before menstruation, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is common to experience diarrhea. If you suddenly experience diarrhea around the expected time of your period, it is likely that menstruation will arrive within the next two days. Sanitary pads should be changed every two to three hours to prevent the growth of bacteria. Excluding sleep time, the worst-case scenario is changing pads six times a day for seven days a month, which amounts to 42 pads. If you include pads prepared in advance, the total may reach around 50 pads, not just one per month. (I should clarify here that tampons do not need to be changed as frequently, approximately every five to six hours, and no longer than eight hours.) During menstruation, hormonal fluctuations may cause irritability, and emotional instability may also occur during ovulation due to changes in internal hormones. It's rather unfortunate, as if the body is tripping itself up. However, official crime rate data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions and do not use emotional issues as an excuse. Menstrual discharge consists not only of blood but also of the shed uterine lining. After menstruation, the uterine lining is at its thinnest and gradually thickens. You can think of the uterus as a house: every month, the house (the lining) is built in preparation for a guest who may not arrive, so it is dismantled (shed during menstruation) and rebuilt the following month. This cycle repeats. Menstruation is inconvenient, with continuous bleeding for several days every month for decades, accompanied by abdominal and back pain. Who would want that? However, people are born because their mothers experienced menstruation. Menstruation prepares the "house" where you will reside for ten months before your arrival in this world. We should all be grateful to our mothers for their regular and healthy menstruation. In the past, many aspects of women's lives were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into believing that menstruation was dirty and shameful. But times have changed. If someone finds menstruation disgusting or considers the body's preparation for nurturing life to be repulsive, they should not express such opinions in public. Girls should stand up for themselves and not think this way. Men who have never experienced and will never experience menstruation and who do not understand it should not be ungrateful or disrespectful. How can they face their mothers with such an attitude, or even think about having their own children? Lastly, ladies, give tampons a try; they are genuinely useful.
