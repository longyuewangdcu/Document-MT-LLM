I just came across an article on menstrual leave that is too long. Here's some information for the men who don't know. Most girls suddenly experience their first period sometime between the ages of 13-15 and menopause around age 50. After that, they will come more regularly once a month, provided they are healthy. However, it is not so regular that it can be precisely predicted, with a tolerance of about a week, which requires advance preparation, and sometimes bad luck can roll over (suddenly several days early). The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of menstrual pain vary from person to person, some people have three days, some a week; some have little flow, some have a big bloodbath; some have little reaction, some have pain until the ambulance transports them away. Menstrual pain changes over time, and just because it didn't hurt before doesn't mean it won't hurt for the rest of your life. Menstruation cannot be controlled, bleeding 24 hours a day for a few days from the beginning to the end. All you can do is to use a sanitary napkin or tampon to absorb the blood to prevent it from flowing onto your clothes and chair. The main reason for menstrual cramps is the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen at the beginning of the physiological period before the menstrual cramps start can effectively relieve the pain of the month, but there is nothing to eat after the menstrual cramps start. It is easy to have diarrhea before the physiological period due to the congestion of the uterus and excessive release of prostaglandins. If it is about time for your cycle and you have diarrhea inexplicably, you will basically get your period within two days. Tampons are best replaced once every two or three hours, otherwise they are prone to bacterial growth, excluding sleep time, the worst case is to replace six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add the copies prepared in advance may have 50 pieces, and not one piece per month. (modified here, tampons do not have to change often, about five or six hours to change once on, the longest eight hours) menstrual hormones may be more irritable, ovulation will also be because of the hormonal changes in the body emotional instability, is very unlucky, the body to their own trip. But the official crime rate data can see that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and will not take emotional problems to make excuses. The flow is not just blood, which contains the shed endometrium. After the end of menstruation, the uterine lining is the thinnest, after slowly thicken, can be understood as the uterus is a house, each month to build a house (lining thickened) ready to welcome guests, guests did not come, all demolished (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, and so on and so forth. Menstruation is inconvenient, continuous for decades, bleeding 24 hours a day for several days a month, and abdominal pain and back pain, who wants it? But a person can be born because his mother had menstruation, and menstruation is to prepare the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come into the world, and everyone should be grateful that their mother had menstruation regularly and healthily. A lot of things about women used to be suppressed, society brainwashed women that it was dirty and shameful, and people thought that's what it was, but times have changed. If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the act of preparing a woman's body for the conception of life is disgusting and should not be said in public, girls stand up and stop thinking that way, men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this life and do not know much about it, do not be so ungrateful and unaware, how can you face your own mother with this attitude and how can you want to have your own children? Finally, the sisters try tampons, really good.
