I just saw an article writing a holiday, which was too long.	 Let's give me a science.	 Most girls suddenly go through the first holiday one day during the age of 13-15, at the age of 50.	 After that, your health will be more regularly every month.	 However, it is not a regular prediction. About a week or so, you need to prepare in advance, and sometimes you will turn over the car (suddenly a few days in advance).	 The time length, blood volume, and dysmenorrhea varies from person to person.	 Change, it did not hurt before it did not mean that it would not hurt for a lifetime.	 The menstruation cannot be controlled. Bleeding 24 hours a few days before the end of the end. All you can do is to use a sanitary napkin or sanitary cotton bar to prevent flowing on the clothes and chairs.	 The dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandin. It has not been time to eat ibuprofen when the physiological period has just started to effectively relieve the pain in the month.	 Before the physiological period, due to uterine congestion and prostaglandin excessive release, diarrhea is easy to be pulled.	 If it comes to the cycle, inexplicably diarrhea, menstruation will basically come in two days. The best sanitary napkin is best replaced every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria and remove the sleep time. The worst situation is to change 6 times a day, 7 days per month, that is 42 tablets.	 The film is not used every month.	 (Modify here, you don't need to change the cotton bars often, you can change it every five or six hours, the longest eight hours.	 Unlucky, the body stumbling for himself.	 However, the official crime rate data can see that women's ability to control emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses to use emotional problems.	 The flow is not just blood, which contains the endometrium of the descendant.	 After the end of the menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly becomes thicker. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Building a house (thicker endometrium) every month is ready to welcome the guests.	 Build a new house in a month, and start weekly.	 Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades in a row, bleeding for 24 hours a few days a month, with abdominal pain and back pain. Who wants?	 However, people can be born because his mother has come to menstruation. The menstruation is to prepare a house for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone wants to thank their mothers to the regular menstruation.	 In the past, many things of women were suppressed. The society was dirty and shameful for women. Everyone thought it was like that, but the times changed.	 If some people think that menstruation is disgusting and feels nauseous to prepare for women's bodies for breeding of life. It should not be said in the general court. Girls stand up, don’t think so, never experienced it.	 Men who do n’t know much about it, do n’t have to be so unforgettable, do n’t know how to do it, how do you feel embarrassed to face his mother, how do you think about your children? Finally, the sisters try the sanitary cotton bar, which is really easy to use.
