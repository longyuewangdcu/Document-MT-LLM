I just read an article about menstruation. It's too long. For men who don't know, most girls will suddenly experience their first period one day between the ages of 13 and 15, and will have amenorrhea around the age of 50. After that, they will come regularly once a month on the premise of good health. But it's not regular enough to accurately predict. It's about a week's tolerance. You need to prepare in advance, and sometimes bad luck will roll overThe length of time, the amount of blood, the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some people three days, some people a week;Some people have fewer people, some people have major bleeding;Some people have no reaction, some people are painful to the ambulance, dysmenorrhea will change over time, before no pain does not mean a lifetime of painless. Menstrual can not be controlled, start to end within a few days of bleeding 24 hours, can only do with sanitary napkins or tampons to prevent blood flow to the clothes chair. Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins, menstrual period has not yet had time to take ibuprofen can effectively relieve the pain of the month,It's no use eating after dysmenorrhea begins. Before the menstrual period, it's easy to have diarrhea because of uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins. If it's about the cycle, it's inexplicable diarrhea, and you'll basically have your period within two days. It is best to change sanitary napkins every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, except for sleep time, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add the preparation in advance may have 50 pieces, not one piece per month.(You don't have to change tampons very often, you can change them every five or six hours, up to eight hours.) Hormonal issues during menstruation can be violent, and ovulation can be emotionally unstable due to hormonal changes in the body. Unfortunately, the body is tripping over itself. But official crime data show that women are still very capable of controlling their emotions, and they don't make excuses for emotional problems. It 's not just blood.It contains the sloughing off of the endometrium, which is thinnest after menstruation and then thickens, meaning that the uterus is a house and builds a house every month(Thickening of the inner membrane) Prepare to receive the guests. The guests did not come. Remove them all.(Menstrual discharge) Next month to build a new house, cycle. Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, bleeding 24 hours a day a few days a month, but also abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants? But people can be born because his mother has menstruation, menstruation is to prepare you for the first time in this world to live in a house for 10 months, we have to thank their mother regularly healthy menstruation. In the past, many things for women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women that it was dirty.Shameful, everyone thought that was the case, but times have changed. If some people find menstruation disgusting, and feel that the female body 's preparation for life is disgusting, and should not be said in public, girls stand up and stop thinking like this. Men who have never experienced it, nor will they experience it in this life, and who do not know much about it, should not be so ungrateful and ungrateful. How can they face their mothers with such an attitude? How can they have the nerve to want their children? Finally, sisters try tampons, really easy to use.
