Metaphysics refers to the use of rational reasoning and logic to study questions that cannot be directly answered through perception. Metaphysics is a fundamental principle of philosophy that aims to explain the basic properties of existence and the world. The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is taken from the sentence "The metaphysical is called the Way; the material is called the vessel" in the "Xici Zhuan" section of the Book of Changes, and was translated from the word "metaphysic" by the Japanese philosopher Tetsuro Watsuji in the Meiji era. Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and related issues. Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns represent only concepts. Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God and its theoretical basis assumes that all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution. Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not refer to God. Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body, especially the brain. Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between the mind and body. Epistemology is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge. Ethics is a discipline that systematically reflects on and studies human moral life, where morality is defined as a set of behavioral standards recognized by a group of people or a culture. It is mainly divided into metaethics (which abstractly studies ethical theories or critiques their essence), normative ethics (which evaluates different moral views and provides moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior, studying what kind of ethical standards people should follow), applied ethics (which applies ethical theories to practical life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (which collects information about how people live and summarizes from observed patterns. Its examination of ethics is not based on anticipated theory but investigates actual moral agents' real choices, all moral factors that contributed to their decisions, and it discusses the ethical views held by social groups). The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics, humanistic ethics represented by figures such as Valla and Montaigne in the first part, ethical ideas of the religious reform represented by Calvin in the second part, political ethics represented by figures such as Machiavelli in the third part, and modern ethics (17-18th century British empiricism ethics, represented by figures such as Hume; 17-18th century European rationalism ethics, represented by figures such as Spinoza; 18th century French Enlightenment ethics, represented by figures such as Voltaire; 18-19th century German academy ethics, represented by figures such as Kant and Hegel; 18-19th century British utilitarian ethics, represented by figures such as Bentham and Mill; 19th century evolutionary ethics, represented by figures such as Spencer and Huxley; late 19th century German Neo-Kantian ethics, represented by figures such as Lotze; late 19th century New Hegelian ethics, represented by figures such as Thomas Hill Green), transitional ethics (non-rationalist ethics, represented by figures such as Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche). Logic is a discipline that studies the principles and standards of "valid inference and proof." Logic typically includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, and can be divided into formal logic and informal logic. Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the nature and meaning of beauty.
