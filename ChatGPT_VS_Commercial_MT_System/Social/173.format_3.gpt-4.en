Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be directly answered through perception, using rational reasoning and logic. Metaphysics is a fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world. The Chinese translation "形而上学" is derived from the phrase "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" in "Yijing - Xici Shangchuan," translated from "metaphysic" by Japanese philosopher Inoue Tetsujiro during the Meiji era. Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and their related issues. Ontology is the study of "which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns only represent a concept." Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God. Its theoretical foundation holds that all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, proposed by philosophers supporting science and evolution. Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that makes no mention of God. Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body, especially the brain. Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and the body. Epistemology is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge. Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks about and studies human moral life; here, morality is defined as all behavioral norms recognized by a group of people or a culture. Ethics can be divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or critiques), normative ethics (evaluating different moral views and providing moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior, studying the moral norms people should follow), applied ethics (applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information on how people live, summarizing patterns from observations, examining ethics based on actual moral agents' decisions, and discussing the ethical views held by social groups). The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics, and is divided into several parts: 1) Humanistic ethical thought, represented by figures like Valla and Montaigne; 2) Ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin; 3) Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others; 4) Modern ethics, including 17-18th century British empiricist ethics (represented by Hume and others), 17-18th century continental rationalist ethics (represented by Spinoza and others), 18th-century French Enlightenment ethics (represented by Voltaire and others), 18-19th century German academic ethics (represented by Kant and Hegel), 18-19th century British utilitarian ethics (represented by Bentham and Mill), 19th century British evolutionary ethics (represented by Spencer and Huxley), late 19th-century German neo-Kantian ethics (represented by Rickert), and late 19th-century neo-Hegelian ethics (represented by Thomas Hill Green); 5) Transitional period ethics, including irrationalist ethics (represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche). Logic is a discipline that studies the "principles and standards of valid inference and proof." Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning. It can be divided into formal logic and informal logic. Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the nature and significance of beauty.
