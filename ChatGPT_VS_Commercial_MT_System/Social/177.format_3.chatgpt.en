Ding Zilin: To my friends. I sincerely thank all of my friends for the humanitarian assistance given to us during the more than 30 years since our loved ones passed away, especially since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to domestic and international friends in early 1994, and the assistance has continued uninterrupted until now. Nowadays, most of the parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and found employment. Your kindness helped us get through the most difficult times. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging worldwide, and most of the donors are already retired. Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop donating to us, the Tiananmen Mothers, for humanitarian assistance. This humanitarian assistance activity should have been concluded long ago. I will always remember your kindness and firmly believe that your good deeds will be remembered by history. Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, and I hope you can understand. Please accept my sincere wishes. Tao Ye'an: Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in humanitarian assistance. During their humanitarian assistance work, the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) were two parallel organizations, and the project implementers often crossed over.

In 1994, at the suggestion of Professor Ding, the "Tiananmen Mothers" established a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian assistance funds. In 1998, the MCDF established the "June Fourth Orphan Education Fund," which was carried out for 11 years. After all the June Fourth orphans graduated from university in 2009, the MCDF then established the "June Fourth Poor Elderly Assistance Fund," which is still being carried out today. The funds for these projects mainly came from donations from campuses and society during the June Fourth incident, from individual generous donations, and received support from brother university democracy foundations. Since 2018, they have also received support from the Labor Education and Research Foundation. Last year, after 31 years, the families of the June Fourth victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June Fourth from Hong Kong. During this period, "Chinese Human Rights" also independently carried out their humanitarian assistance projects. We understand that Professor Ding's call to stop donating to the June Fourth victims is for the consideration of the donors, many of whom are retired and no longer have the same level of income as before retirement. Therefore, we would like to express our gratitude to Professor Ding for her "To My Friends" letter. We will respect the decision of the victims' families and terminate this project within two years, and immediately resume it if necessary. We express our gratitude and respect to those who have been generously donating and risking delivering humanitarian aid for many years.
