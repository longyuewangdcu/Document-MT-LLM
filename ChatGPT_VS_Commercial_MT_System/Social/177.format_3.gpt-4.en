Ding Zilin: To my friends. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all friends for the humanitarian assistance given to us during the more than 30 years after the tragedy of our loved ones. Especially since my personal appeal for humanitarian aid to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, the assistance has not been interrupted so far. By now, the vast majority of the elderly parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, married, and found jobs. It is your righteous deeds that have helped our families in distress through the most difficult moments. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc around the world, and most of the donors have reached retirement age. Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop providing humanitarian donations to us, the family members of the victims - the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian assistance activity should have been brought to a perfect end long ago. I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be recorded in history. Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way. Please understand, my friends! Please accept my sincere blessings. Tao Ye'an: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid by the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF). During the process of humanitarian assistance, the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.

In 1994, at the suggestion of Professor Ding, a special group was formed by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian relief funds. In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund." After 11 years of operation, in 2009, when all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Destitute Elderly Special Assistance Fund," which has been in operation ever since. The funding for these projects mainly comes from campus and social donations during June 4th, generous personal donations, and the support of sibling university democracy foundations. Since 2018, they have also received support from the Laogai Research Foundation. Last year, 31 years later, the families of the June 4th victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June 4th from Hong Kong. During this period, "China Human Rights" also independently carried out their humanitarian aid projects. We understand that Professor Ding's call to stop the June 4th donations is considering the donors, as we are indeed all retired elderly people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude for Professor Ding's letter "To My Friends." We will respect the decision of the families and terminate this project within two years. If necessary, we will immediately resume it. We would like to express our gratitude and respect to those chivalrous and righteous individuals who have persisted in generously donating and risking delivering humanitarian aid funds for many years.
