Ding Zilin: To our friends. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for the humanitarian assistance you have provided for more than 30 years since our loved ones were killed, especially since I made a personal appeal to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has not been interrupted so far. Today, the majority of the victims' elderly parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and become employed. It is your kindness that has helped our bereaved families through the most difficult times. Now that the New Guinea epidemic is raging around the world, most of our donors have reached retirement. Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop your humanitarian donations to the Tiananmen Mothers, our hard-luck family, as it is long past time to bring this humanitarian campaign to a perfect conclusion. I will always remember your love and am convinced that your act of charity will be remembered by history. For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, so please understand my friends! Please accept my sincere blessings. Tao Ye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the All American Federation of Students for Self Study (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy (MCDF) in humanitarian relief. In engaging in humanitarian relief, ACSL and the Minnesota Foundation for Chinese Democracy are two parallel organizations, with program implementers often crossing over.

To those fellow chivalrous people who have persisted in their generosity and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid over the years, we express our gratitude and respect.
