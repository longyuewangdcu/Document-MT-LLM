Ding Zilin: To friends.	 I sincerely thank your friends for the humanitarian assistance given by our relatives for more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones. Especially in early 1994, I had sent an excessive humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.	 Rescue.	 Nowadays, most of the elderly parents of the victims have thanked the world, and the orphans have grown up to employment.	 It is your righteousness to help us have the most difficult moments.	 At present, the new crown epidemic is raging globally, and most donors have also retired every year.	 Therefore, I earnestly asked you to stop giving us difficulty -Tiananmen Mother's group humanitarian donation, this humanitarian rescue activity should have been perfectly ended.	 I will always remember your love and believe that your righteousness will be remembered for history.	 For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, and please forgive me!	 Please accept my sincere blessings.	 Ceramics: Please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32 -year history of humanitarian assistance for the Humanitarian rescue of the National Foundation (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democratic Foundation (MCDF). 在从事人道主义救助的过程中，全美学自联与明尼苏达中国民主基金会是平行的两个组织，项目的执行者常有交叉。（苹果日报图：天安門母親網站由陶業負責打理。）pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm救助款常常不能顺利送达六四难属手中。1994年，经丁老师建议，由“天安门母亲”成立专门小组，统筹和负责人道救助款的接收与分发。1998年，MCDF设立《六四孤儿教育基金》，执行11年后，于2009年，在所有六四孤儿都大学毕业后，MCDF继而设立《六四孤苦老人特困户救助基金》，并一直执行至今。这些项目的资金，主要来自六四当年的校园和社会捐款，来自个人的慷慨捐助，并受到兄弟大学民主基金会的支持。自2018年起，还得到了劳改研究基金会的支持。直到去年，时隔31年后，六四难属们终于收到了一笔来自香港的当年以六四的名义募捐来的部分捐款。在此期间，《中国人权》也在独立地执行它们的人道救助项目。我们理解，丁老师叫停六四捐助，是为捐款人考虑，我们也确实都是一些退休老人，收入并非如退休前充裕，特此对丁老师的“致友人”一信表示感谢。 We will respect the decisions of the difficulties, terminate this project within two years, and immediately recover.	 For those colleagues who have been generous and risky, they have expressed their gratitude and respect.
