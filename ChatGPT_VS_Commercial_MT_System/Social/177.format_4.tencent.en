Ding Zilin:To my friends. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all of you for your humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally appealed for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994. Now, the parents of most of the victims have passed away.The orphans have grown up and have families and jobs. It is your kindness that has helped us through the most difficult times. The COVID-19 epidemic is raging around the world, and most of the donors are nearing retirement. Therefore, I sincerely ask you to stop donating to the Tiananmen Mothers Group, which belongs to us. This humanitarian relief activity should have come to a perfect end long ago. I will always remember your love.And I firmly believe that your righteous act will be remembered in history. For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends! Please accept my sincere blessings.Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance provided by IFCSS and MCDF. In the process of humanitarian relief, the All-China Federation of Students and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the project implementers often overlap.(Photo of Apple Daily:The Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by Tao Ye.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm Relief funds often fail to reach the victims of the June 4th incident. In 1994, at the suggestion of Mr. Ding, the Tiananmen Mothers set up a special team to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds. In 1998, MCDF established the June 4th Orphans Education Fund, which was implemented for 11 years. In 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from college,The MCDF then established the "June 4th Relief Fund for the Elderly and the Poor", which has been in operation since then. The funds for these projects are mainly from the campus and social donations of the June 4th year, from generous donations from individuals, and supported by the Sister University Democracy Foundation. Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Reform through Labor Research Foundation. Until last year, after 31 years,We understand that Mr. Ding stopped the donation for the sake of the donors. We are all retired old people and our income is not as good as before. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Ding for his letter to a friend. We will respect the families 'decision to terminate the program within two years and resume it as soon as necessary. We also thank and pay tribute to those who have been generous and brave enough to deliver humanitarian aid over the years.
