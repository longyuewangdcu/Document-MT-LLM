I am a programming novice who wants to share my personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training. However, if you don't have such an idea, it is better to learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money and takes six months to complete. But if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed an excellent choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline. Choosing a good training institution is very important. First, you need to look at the teaching staff. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, the training institution will not make sense. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong teaching staff. Secondly, before choosing, inquire about the training institution. It is best to inquire about the students who have studied in the institution, as only the students know whether the institution is good or not. Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't know your situation. Learning this thing is closely related to personal circumstances, such as major, age, language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of which are related to the industry you want to study or engage in. If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or have graduated from a computer major, I personally recommend self-study if you have sufficient time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. There are also many offline and online training institutions that are actually very good, but the cost is high, and you need to invest a lot of time, basically requiring 3-6 months of concentrated training. But if you fall into the situations I just described, self-learning is very convenient. Nowadays, there are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can go to Bilibili where there are many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be used in combination with videos for comprehensive learning. If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay some learning costs in terms of time and money, it is recommended to go to a training institution for learning. In this way, learning is not very difficult, the teacher's explanations are also very detailed, and there are people dedicated to answering questions. In addition, training institutions now often have employment agreements and internal referral quotas, and can recommend you to companies after your studies, which can save you a lot of trouble in the later job search and interview process. These are just my opinions, and because I don't know your situation, I can only provide a general introduction. If you have other questions or would like to consult, feel free to contact me for further communication.
