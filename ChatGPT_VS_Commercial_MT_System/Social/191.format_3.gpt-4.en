A programming newbie wants to share their personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have such an idea, it's better to learn by yourself, after all, the cost of training is quite high, and it takes 6 months to learn. However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline. Training is an excellent choice. If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it may be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First, you need to look at the strength of the faculty. If the faculty is not strong enough, the training institution is not very meaningful. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty. Secondly, before choosing, inquire about the training institution, and it's best to investigate the students from the institution, after all, only the students know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or not. Hello, I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't provided enough information about your personal situation, and learning has a lot to do with one's personal circumstances. For example, your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you live in are all related to the industry you want to learn or engage in. If you are a student who hasn't graduated yet or has graduated with a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study, as it is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Many offline and online training institutions are actually quite good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is relatively large, basically requiring 3-6 months of concentrated training. However, if you are in the situations I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Many learning resources on the internet are free, or you can find many training resources on Bilibili. If you can't find resources, you can contact me through my bio to get free resources or detailed consultation. Additionally, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning. If you are not a computer major but can afford the cost of learning in terms of money and time, I suggest going to a training institution for learning. This way, the learning process is less strenuous, the teachers explain in detail, and there are dedicated people to answer questions. Moreover, it helps with learning planning and supervision. Many training institutions now sign employment agreements, offer internal referrals, and recommend students to companies after learning, making the interview process easier when looking for a job. The above are some of my opinions. Since I don't know your situation, my introduction is only approximate and not detailed. If you have other questions, feel free to contact me for communication and discussion.
