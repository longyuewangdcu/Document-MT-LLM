A programming white who wants to share his personal experience. If you are planning to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you do not have this idea, it is best to learn on your own, after all, the training to spend a lot of money, and also with 6 months of time to learn. But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, then training is really a very good choice, especially those who have weak self-control and training is a very good choice. If your own self-control is stronger, you can also choose to learn on your own, but will be more tired. Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing. The first thing to look at this institution's faculty, if the faculty is not strong enough, this training institution is not very meaningful, of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong faculty. Secondly, before choosing to explore this training institution, it is best to explore the students who came out of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution will know how this institution in the end, explain the course is good or bad. Hello, in fact, you ask this question I do not know how to answer, because your own situation does not do a certain introduction, and learning this thing and the individual's own situation has a lot to do with the. For example, your major, your age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of these will have a relationship with the industry you want to study or work in. If you are a student and have not graduated, or a computer professional has graduated, then if you have enough time I personally recommend self-learning, this is the least efficient and costly, now a lot of offline online training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, the second investment of time is more, the basic need to focus on training 3-6 months. But if these are the cases I mentioned, self-study is very convenient, and now many learning resources on the network are free, or go to the b site also has a lot of training resources, if you will not find resources, you can also contact me through the profile to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK. In addition, there are some more classic books can be combined with video integrated learning. If you are not a computer professional, but also able to pay a certain amount of money and time cost of learning, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn, so that learning does not have to be very laborious, the teacher explained in detail, there are also people dedicated to answering questions, in addition to learning planning or supervision is also helpful. And now a lot of training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal promotion quota, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the back of the job search interview link can also save a lot of things. The above is my opinion, because I do not understand your situation, so only about the introduction is not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can always contact me for communication.
