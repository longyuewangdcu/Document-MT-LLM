A programming Xiaobai who wants to share personal experience.	 If you plan to enter the industry in this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you do n’t have this idea, it is best to learn it yourself. After all, the training needs to be spent.	 Learn for a month.	 But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially those who have self -control and weakness, training is a very good choice.	 If you have a strong self -control, you can choose to learn by yourself, but it will be tired.	 Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.	 First of all, it depends on the teacher's teacher's teacher. If the teacher's power is not strong enough, this training institution will not make much sense. Of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong.	 Secondly, after choosing, you can inquire about this training institution. It is best to inquire students from this institution. After all, only the institutional students know how this institution is, and the courses explained are good or bad.	 Hello, in fact, I do n’t know how to answer this question, because I do n’t do a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with the individual's own situation.	 For example, professional, age, language, and even in any city, these will have something to do with the industry you learn or want to engage in.	 If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you have graduated from computer majors, if time is sufficient, I personally recommend self -study. This is the lowest efficiency and cost. Now many offline training institutions are actually very good.	 , But the cost of learning is high, and the second investment time is more. Basically, we need to be trained for 3-6 months. But if I said these situations, it is very convenient to study. Many of the learning resources on the Internet now are free, or there are many training resources when you go to station B. If you don’t find resources, you can also contact by brief introduction.	 To me, get free resources, or detailed consultation.	 In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.	 If you are not a computer professional, but you can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to study institutions to learn. This is not very laborious to learn. The teacher explains very detailed.	 Or it is also helpful in supervision.	 In addition, many training institutions will sign an employment agreement, and there are internal pushing places. After studying, it is recommended to go to the company. In this way, the interview link to find a job later can save a lot of things.	 The above is some of my views. Because I do n’t understand your situation, I ’m probably not detailed. If you have other people who want to consult, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
