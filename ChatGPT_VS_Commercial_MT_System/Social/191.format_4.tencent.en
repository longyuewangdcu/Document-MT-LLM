A programming novice who wants to share his personal experience. If you plan to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn. But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control.Training is a very good choice. If you have strong self-control, you can also choose self-study, but it will be tired. Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution. First of all, it depends on the faculty of this institution. If the faculty is not strong enough, this training institution will have no meaning. Of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong. Secondly, inquire about this training institution before choosing.It is best to inquire about the students from this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like and whether the courses they explain are good or not. Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because I haven't made a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation. For example, major, age, language you want to learn, or even which city you are in.These will be and you learn or want to engage in the industry.If you are a student and have not graduated, or computer professional has graduated, then if the time is sufficient I personally suggest self-study, this is the efficiency and cost of the lowest, now a lot of offline online training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, two investment time is more, the basic need for concentrated training 3-6 months. But if I say these circumstances, self-study is very convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the network are free, or go to b station also has a lot of training resources, if you don't find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction, get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK. There are also some more classic books can be combined with video integrated learning. If you are not a computer professional, but also can pay a certain amount of money and time cost of learning,So it is recommended to go to the training institutions to learn, so that learning does not have to be very hard, the teacher explained in detail, there are also special questions to answer, and in addition to learning planning or supervision is also helpful. And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal promotion places, after learning recommended to go to the company, so that the interview link behind the job can save a lot of things. The above are some of my views, said in front because I do not understand your situation,So only about the introduction is not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
