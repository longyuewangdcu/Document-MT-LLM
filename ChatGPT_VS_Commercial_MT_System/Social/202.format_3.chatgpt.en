Although the rightists had their heyday in history, it was short-lived because they shine with just a little bit of sunshine and sweat with just a little bit of water. They are eager for more when they achieve something and attach themselves to whoever is in power when they face setbacks. However, to be fair, the rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress. The positive significance of the rightists should not be denied in terms of defining the standards of truth after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving science and technology, promoting institutionalization of the political system and safeguarding human rights, etc. As for myself, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's remarks, I care about what he says and respect him as a person because he is serious about China, its society, and its problems. However, I oppose his anti-Communist theory, as I believe that anti-revolution is necessary and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, and political groups that are mixed and disorderly, and that foreign countries will take advantage of this. To change or improve China, we need to have patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Those who try to take advantage of political opportunism are not rightists, they are bastards. Let's talk about the left. The left is actually a group of abandoned children of the times and politics. If the right has a positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of their opinions and analyze their ideas when needed, then the left has no such fortune because what they want is precisely what the Communist Party has thrown away! Recently, I have seen some friends arguing against anti-government people and refuting the leftists at the same time, and they seem quite upset. I think there is no need to do so. "Don't bother trying to reason with traitors or leftists. They're both stubborn and irrational. Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the anti-communists or leftists admit it. What's the point? Instead, I tell my friends: When anti-communists call you a ""50 cent party member,"" and when leftists call you a ""rightist dog,"" it just proves that our middle path is the right one! Many people have ideals when they are young, but they forget about them when they get older, or they become obsessed with them. They drift further away from their ideals, and sometimes even become the opposite of what they once were. Left and right, in my opinion, generally refer to restraint and freedom. Due to China's historical and cultural genes, China as a whole should be more left-leaning. The right-wing in China values freedom, efficiency, and development, while the left-wing emphasizes regulation, fairness, and security. At present, society as a whole hopes to focus more on fairness, and with the ongoing Sino-U.S. conflict, it's clear that China is leaning left, and this trend is likely to continue for many years. Although I don't understand it, I'll still give it a thumbs up and leave it at that. That's how generous I am."
