Although the right-wing has had its moments of triumph in history, they were not long-lasting. The reason for their short-lived success is that they tend to become overly exuberant with a little sunshine and break a sweat with just a sip of water; they overreach when they gain a little power and become disoriented when faced with setbacks. However, to be fair, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress. From ending the Cultural Revolution and defining the standard of truth, to promoting economic development, improving science and technology, as well as promoting the institutionalization of the political system and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied. As for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I do care about and respect what he says and the person he is. This is because he is serious â€“ serious about China and serious about addressing the social issues in China. However, I oppose his anti-communist theories. I believe that a necessary revolution would inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, political chaos, and foreign forces taking advantage of the situation. Changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude for the country and its people. Political opportunists who attempt to exploit the situation are not right-wing, they are scoundrels. Now, let's talk about the left. The left is actually a group of abandoned children of the times and politics. If the right has a positive significance for society and the Communist Party listens to some right-wing opinions and analyzes their thoughts when needed, then the left is not so fortunate, because what the left wants is precisely the dross that the Communist Party has discarded! Recently, I have seen some friends passionately criticizing both dissidents and the left-wing fanatics, and I think there's no need for that. Don't try to reason with traitors or left-wing fanatics, as they are both stubborn and unreasonable. Also, don't try to prove that we are right, and even more so, don't try to make dissidents and left-wing fanatics admit it. What's the point? I tell my friends this: when dissidents call you a "wumao" (50-cent party member) and left-wing fanatics call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct! Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they grow old, they either forget their ideals or pursue them to the point of becoming paranoid. They become more and more distant from their ideals, and even a young dragon slayer may ultimately turn into an evil dragon. In my opinion, the terms "left" and "right" generally refer to constraints and freedom. The innate cultural and historical genes of China lead it to lean towards the left. The domestic right-wing values freedom, efficiency, and development, while the left-wing emphasizes stronger regulation, focusing on fairness and security. Nowadays, society as a whole hopes for more fairness, and with the ongoing competition between China and the United States, leaning to the left is inevitable and likely to continue for many years. Although I may not understand everything, I'll just like it and say nothing more. That's just how supportive I am.
