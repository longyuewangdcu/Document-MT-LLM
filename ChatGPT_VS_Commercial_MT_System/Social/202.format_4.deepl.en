Secondly, although the rightists have aspirations in history, but not for a long time, so short because a little sunshine will be brilliant, drink some boiling water will sweat; a little ambition will be to get a long hope, by the blow will be hair will be attached. But realistically speaking, the rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress. The positive significance of the Right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection. Third, for my part, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about what he says and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious about China and he is serious about China's social problems. However, I am against his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups and mud, and then foreign countries will take advantage of the situation. Fourth, change or improve China must have patience and responsible attitude for the country and the people, political speculation in an attempt to take the chestnuts in the fire, that is not the right, is an asshole. Talk about the left again. The left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics. If the right has a positive meaning to society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their ideas when needed, then the left does not have this creation, because what the left wants is exactly the dregs that the Communist Party throws away! Five, recently saw some friends dislike the anti-thief while refuting the left epilepsy, but also quite moving real gas, I think it is not necessary. Do not try to reason with the traitor and the left epileptic, they are a tendency to be unreasonable. And don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the traitor and the left epileptic admit it, why bother? I tell my friends this: when the rebels call you fifty cents, when the left epileptic calls you a right dog, it just proves that this middle way of ours is correct! Many people have ideals when they are teenagers, but when they are old, they forget them, or pursue them, but they are reduced to paranoia. And the ideal drifted away, and even dragon slaying teenagers eventually become the evil dragon. Left and right I think generally refers to restraint and freedom, China from the history and culture of the innate genes leading to China as a whole should be left. The domestic right is free, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left strengthens regulation and pays more attention to fairness as well as security. Now society in general wants to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the United States are fighting each other, the left is certain, it is estimated to continue for many years. Although you can't read it, the point of praise on the end of the matter what not to say, flowers is so righteous
