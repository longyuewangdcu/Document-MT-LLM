Second, although the right school has a long time in history, it is not long, so the short is because it is brilliant to give a little sunlight.	 But in terms of facts, rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress.	 The positive significance of the right should not deny the positive significance of the right of the right from ending the standard of the truth of the definition of the Cultural Revolution and the development of the economy and the promotion of administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantee.	 Third, as far as I am concerned, although I do n’t fully agree with Li Weidong's claims, I care about his statement and respect Li Weidong. Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also a social issue in China.	 Look carefully.	 But I oppose his anti -communist theory. I think that anti -revolutionary revolution, the revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, the people's livelihood is damaged, and the political groups are mixed with mud.	 Fourth, change or improve China's patience and be responsible for the country and the people. Political speculative attempts to take the shudder in the fire. That is not the right, but a bastard.	 Talk to the left.	 Left is actually a group of times and politics abandoned.	 If the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not be made, because the left is the dross thrown by the Communist Party!	 5. Recently, I saw some friends who were fighting against the thieves and refuted left epilepsy. Do not try to reason with traitors and Zuo Eppyolics. They are all tendons, unreasonable.	 Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the anti -thief and left epilepsy admit, why bother?	 I told my friends like this: When the anti -thief scolds you five hairs, when the left epilepsy scolds your right dog, it just proves that our intermediate road is correct!	 Many people also have ideals when they were young. When they were old, they forgot their ideals or pursuing ideals, but they became paranoid.	 The ideal is drifting away, and even the Dragon Tuzu teenager eventually became a evil dragon.	 I think it generally refers to restraint and freedom. China ’s congenital genes from historical and culture have caused China as a whole.	 The domestic right is free, focusing on efficiency and development, strengthening supervision, and paying more attention to fairness and safety.	 At present, society hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, it is certain that China and the United States are struggling. It is estimated that it has to last for many years.	 Although I don’t understand, just do nothing if you like it.
