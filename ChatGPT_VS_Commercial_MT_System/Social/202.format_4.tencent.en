Second, although the Rightists have had periods of success in history, they have not been long, so they are short because they are brilliant when given a little sunshine and sweat when drinking a little boiled water;The Rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress. In terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights, we should not deny the positive significance of the Rightists. Third, as far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about his statements and respect Li Weidong very much.Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China's social problems seriously. But I oppose his anti-Communist theory. I believe that anti-necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, a mixture of good and bad political groups, and foreign countries taking advantage of the situation to enter. Fourth, to change or improve China, we must have patience and an attitude of being responsible for the country and the people. Those who attempt to take chestnuts out of the fire for political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards. Let's talk about left. Left again.In fact, they are a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics. If the Right has positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some Right remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, then the Left does not have such a good fortune, because what the Left wants is exactly the dross thrown away by the Communist Party! 5. Recently, I saw some friends criticizing the rebels while refuting the Left madness. They were quite angry, but I think it is unnecessary. Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists. They are all one-track minded and unreasonable. Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about getting traitors and leftists to admit it. Why bother? I told my friends like this:When rebels scold you for 50 cents, and when leftists scold you for being a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle-of-the-road path is correct! Many people also had ideals when they were young, but when they got old, they forgot their ideals, or pursued their ideals, but became paranoid. They gradually drifted away from their ideals, and even the dragon-slaying youth eventually became evil dragons. I think left and right generally refer to restraint and freedom. China's innate genes from history and culture have led to China's overall deviation to the left. On the other hand, the rightists in China are free and pay attention to efficiency and development.The leftists have strengthened supervision and paid more attention to fairness and security. Now society generally hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the Sino-US conflict is definitely left-leaning, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years. Although I don't understand it, I just like it and it's over. I don't say anything. Huahua is just so loyal
