In the past two years, the United States has imposed a blockade and containment on Huawei's chips, which has not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament but also caused huge losses to "American" companies. The US's suppression of China's chip industry requires its own companies and allied companies to simultaneously block our country's chip industry, directly resulting in the global chip supplier's orders and profits being affected, causing a decrease in research and development investment and production capacity of chip production companies, thus causing disruptions in the global chip supply chain. Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has spread to various industries around the world, such as car manufacturers shutting down production and mobile phone prices increasing. Almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected. In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips," more and more technology giants in various countries are beginning to move towards the "de-Americanization" path. In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control, and to restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit," inviting 64 country giants to establish a semiconductor alliance, and providing funding support to US domestic technology giants. For example, the old American technology giant Intel, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, invested 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened chip outsourcing business to the outside world. When most people thought that Intel's move would cause a certain impact on TSMC and was likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl," TSMC's founder, Zhang Zhongmou, was indifferent. At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou was astonishingly blunt about Intel's move to spend money building a wafer factory, saying that Intel's establishment of a chip outsourcing factory was quite ironic. The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite contemptuous of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that he still bears a grudge against a period of enmity between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago. In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pride of American manufacturing, occupying a dominant position at the top of the global semiconductor industry and becoming a leader in the field. In the 1980s, only a few powerful players controlled the high-end semiconductor chip market. At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era. However, this model made it difficult for small enterprises to cope, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs faced huge production line construction costs and could only shy away. Under the call of market demand, the chip industry began to see the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation in the 1980s. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard about a company that specialized in chip design, he believed that if there were companies specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established. Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and TSMC was born. TSMC focused its main business on "wafer processing", not design, only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing. At the time, the newly established TSMC was just a small player compared to the giant Intel. In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only manufactured the manufacturing process of the chip industry, they obviously had a high opinion of themselves and looked down on TSMC, decisively rejecting any investment in TSMC. Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel at the time looked down on wafer manufacturing services. It's ironic that the industry giant who once looked down on wafer manufacturing services now has to start doing wafer foundry. Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that Intel's entry into wafer foundry is very ironic. Nowadays, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel. Faced with TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally cannot rest on its laurels. Today, TSMC is already sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago. Catching up is not an easy task.
