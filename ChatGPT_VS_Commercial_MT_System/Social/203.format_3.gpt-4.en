In the past two years, the US blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips have not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament but also caused huge losses for "American" companies. The US suppression of China's chip industry, demanding that its own enterprises and allied countries simultaneously block China's chip industry, has directly led to the impact on orders and profits of global chip suppliers, causing a reduction in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturing enterprises, and thus resulting in a global shortage and disorder of the chip supply chain. Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected major industries worldwide, such as car manufacturers halting production and mobile phone prices increasing, with almost all industries that use chips being adversely affected. In order to gain control of "chips," more and more tech giants from various countries are moving towards a path of "de-Americanization." In order to firmly control the global semiconductor market and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the US has recently been very active, hosting "chip summits," inviting 64 countries to form a semiconductor alliance, and supporting domestic tech giants with financial assistance. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, the US tech giant Intel invested $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona and opened up chip foundry services to others. Most people thought that Intel's move would impact TSMC to some extent and possibly take away TSMC's "rice bowl." The reason for such certainty is that, as an old US tech giant, Intel has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, boasting a large talent pool and technical reserves, and is bound to rise rapidly in the short term, defeating TSMC. However, TSMC founder Morris Chang seems unimpressed by Intel's decision. At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April, Morris Chang made a surprising statement, saying without hesitation regarding Intel's investment in building wafer fabs: "Intel building a chip foundry is quite ironic." The reason why Morris Chang is disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that he still bears a grudge against the old feud between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago. In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the crown jewel of American manufacturing, occupying a peak position globally and dominating the world's semiconductor field. By the 1980s, high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a few powerful players. At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM (Integrated Device Manufacturer) model, where a single factory handled chip design, manufacturing, and packaging. Intel was the representative of that era. However, this model was too burdensome for some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only back off when faced with huge production line construction costs. Driven by market demand, the chip industry began to experience division of labor and collaboration in the 1980s. In 1984, Morris Chang heard about companies that specialized in chip design and thought that if there were companies dedicated to design, then a factory could be established specifically for wafer manufacturing. Not long after, Chang's idea became a reality, and TSMC was born. TSMC focused its main business on the single link of "wafer processing," not engaging in design but only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing. At that time, newly-founded TSMC was just a small player in front of the giant Intel. In order to obtain capital support, Morris Chang once sought investment from Intel. However, when Intel heard that TSMC only handled the manufacturing aspect of the chip industry, they clearly held themselves in high regard and looked down on TSMC, decisively refusing to invest in the company. Morris Chang also believed that Intel at that time did not value wafer manufacturing services. Unexpectedly, the giant that once looked down on wafer manufacturing services now also wants to start doing wafer foundry work. Therefore, Morris Chang thinks it is quite ironic for Intel to enter the wafer foundry business. Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel. Faced with TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally cannot afford to be complacent. At present, TSMC is already sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago. Catching up is not an easy task.
