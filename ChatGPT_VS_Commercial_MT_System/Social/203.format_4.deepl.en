In the past two years, the U.S. empire's blockade and siege of Huawei chip, not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also let the "U.S. system" enterprises suffered huge losses. The U.S. empire suppressed China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allies to block China's chip industry at the same time, a direct consequence is that the global chip suppliers' orders and profits have been affected, resulting in lower investment in research and development and lower production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a global shortage of disruption in the chip supply chain. Now the "lack of core" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as car companies to stop production, cell phone prices, almost all the industries that use chips are deeply affected by it. In order to grasp the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' technology giants began to "go to the beautification" of the road. In order to firmly control the global control of semiconductors, to control the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States recently moved a lot, and host the "chip summit"; and invited 64 countries to set up a semiconductor alliance, and pull money to support the U.S. domestic technology giants, for example, the old U.S. empire technology giant Intel in order to recapture the dominant position in the field of chips For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel spent $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and open up the chip foundry business to the public. When most people thought that Intel's move will have some impact on TSMC, and is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl". The reason why so sure, because Intel as the United States empire old technology giant, in the field of semiconductor deep decades, has a large number of talent team and technology reserves, will be able to quickly rise in the short term, to defeat TSMC. However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was not impressed. In the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement, for Intel to spend money to build fabs this move, Zhang Zhongmou no scruples to say: Intel build chip foundry, quite ironic. The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still harbors a grudge against TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago. In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel had been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the U.S. Empire, majestically occupying the position of the global pinnacle, the world's hegemon in the field of semiconductors. By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been in the hands of a few powerful players. At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured and packaged by a single factory, and Intel was a representative of that era. However, such a model overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only be deterred by the huge production line construction costs. Inspired by market demand, the chip industry began to see a division of labor and cooperation after entering the 1980s. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were those specializing in design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established. Soon after, Chang's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born. TSMC aimed its main business at "wafer processing" as a single segment, not designing but only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing. At that time, TSMC was a small minion in front of the giant Intel. In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had sought investment from Intel, but at that time, once Intel heard that TSMC was only doing the manufacturing part of the chip industry, it was obvious that some of them thought highly of themselves and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC. Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on the wafer fabrication services at that time. I didn't expect that the giant who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then would now start doing wafer foundry. So, Zhang Zhongmou finds it ironic that Intel has entered the foundry. Now TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's. In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to stand still. Today, TSMC has been sprinting toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck in the 14nm 7 years ago. trying to catch up is actually not easy.
