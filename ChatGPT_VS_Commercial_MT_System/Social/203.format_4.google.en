In the past two years, the United States' blockade and enclosure of Huawei chips not only caused Huawei to fall into unprecedented difficulties, but also caused huge losses for "American" companies.	 The US emperor suppressed the Chinese chip industry and demanded that its own enterprises and allies related enterprises to block the chip industry in my country at the same time. The direct result is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a decrease in research and development investment in chip production enterprises, decreased production capacity , Resulting in the disorder of the shortage of chip supply chains worldwide.	 Today, the "lack of cores" has affected major industries in the world, such as car companies to stop production and increase their mobile phones. Almost all industries used in chips are deeply harmed.	 In order to grasp the autonomy of "chip", more and more national science and technology giants have begun to move towards the path of "de -beautification".	 In order to firmly control the control of global semiconductor and restrain the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, Lao and the United States have recently been frequent, and they are also hosting the "Chip Summit".	 For example, in order to regain the dominant position of the chip field, Intel, the old -fashioned technology giant in the United States, spent 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened a chip foundry business to the outside world.	 When most people think that Intel's move this time will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to snatch TSMC's "rice bowl".	 The reason why it is so affirmation is that, as an old -fashioned technology giant in the United States, Intel has cultivated in the semiconductor field for decades. With a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, it will definitely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.	 However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdain.	 At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou was amazing. Zhang Zhongmou was not upright for Intel to spend the WAilin Factory: Intel built a chip foundry factory, it was quite ironic.	 The reason why Zhang Zhongmou was disdainful to Intel's march to enter the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou was still worried about a period of grievance between TSE and Intel more than 30 years ago. In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the US Emperor's manufacturing industry. It ranks at the top of the world and is the hegemon of the world's semiconductor field.	 By the 1980s, world semiconductor high -end chips had been controlled by a few strong men.	 At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM mode. The chip was completed from design, manufacturing to sealing and testing. Intel was the representative of that era.	 However, such models make some small companies overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge amount of production line construction costs.	 Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to have a phenomenon of division of labor cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design.	 Factory made in wafer.	 Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and TSMC came into being.	 TSMC aimed at the single link of "wafer processing" for its main business. It did not design, and only provided foundry services for wafer manufacturing.	 At that time, TSMC, which was just founded, was a little bitter in front of the Giant Intel.	 In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had invested in Intel, but at that time, Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing process of the chip industry, it was obviously a bit high, and he looked down on TSMC and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.	 Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer -based services at the time. Unexpectedly, the giants of the wafer manufacturing service that year, but now they have to start working as a wafer foundry.	 Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt ironic that Intel entered the wafer foundry.	 Today, the market value of TSMC has exceeded Intel.	 Faced with the strong offensive of TSMC, Intel naturally did not dare to stop himself.	 Today, TSMC has sprinted towards the 3nm chip, and Intel still stays at 14nm 7 years ago.	 It's not easy to catch up.
