In the past two years, the US imperialist blockade and containment of Huawei chips has not only caused Huawei to fall into unprecedented difficulties, but also caused "American" companies to suffer huge losses. The US imperialist suppressed China's chip industry and required its own companies and related companies in its allies to block China's chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in reduced R & D investment and reduced production capacity of chip manufacturers.This has led to a global shortage of chip supply chain disorder. Now "lack of core" has spread to major industries around the world, such as car companies stop production, mobile phone prices, almost all industries using chips are suffering. In order to grasp the autonomy of "chip", more and more countries 'technology giants have begun to move towards the road of "de-beautification". In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently made frequent moves.Also hosted the "Chip Summit";The company is also inviting 64 countries to form a semiconductor alliance and allocate funds to support the US technology giants. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, the US veteran technology giant Intel has invested 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened up its chip foundry business to the outside world. When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is very likely to steal TSMC's "rice bowl". The reason why it is so sure,This is because Intel, as a veteran technology giant in the US, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades. With a large number of talent teams and technology reserves, it is bound to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC. However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive. At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement. For Intel to invest in the construction of a wafer factory, Zhang Zhongmou said without scruples:The irony of Intel building a foundry is that Mr. Chang's disdain for Intel's foray into the wafer business stems from a grudge he still harbors over a period of more than 30 years between TSMC and Intel. In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was always the pearl of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the world, and was the overlord of the world's semiconductor field. By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been controlled by a few strong players. At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. The chip was designed, manufactured, and tested by a factory. Intel was the representative of that era. However, such a model made some small businesses overwhelmed.Many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only flinch in the face of huge production line construction costs. Inspired by market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established. Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality.TSMC came into being. TSMC aimed its main business at the single link of "wafer processing". It did not design, but only provided foundry services for wafer manufacturing. At that time, TSMC, which was just founded, was a small fry in front of Intel, a giant. In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once looked for Intel to invest, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it obviously had some self-esteem and looked down on TSMC.Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer processing services at that time. I didn't expect that the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services would start to do wafer foundry now. So, Zhang Zhongmou thinks that Intel's entry into wafer foundry is ironic. Now TSMC's market value has surpassed Intel. In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels. Now, TSMC has been sprinting toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago. It is not easy to catch up.
