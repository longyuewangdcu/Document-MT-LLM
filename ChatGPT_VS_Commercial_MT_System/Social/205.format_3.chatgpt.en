Today, let's take a look at some "strange hot searches". What is a normal public opinion? Randomly select three hot searches: "Dragon Raising its Head on the Second Day of the Second Lunar Month", "Haoliyou price increase", "Huo La La incident", the public opinion spreads and forms a peak, then the "index drops" (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small camel hump appearing again. They look no different from the "Internet public opinion evolution model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. What is abnormal public opinion? Randomly select six hot searches from the same event, presenting "isolated peaks", "sawtooth shapes", and "cliff shapes". "Isolated peaks" are artificially heated, quickly rushing to the top of the hot search list and attracting public attention; "sawtooth shapes" are periodically heated to ensure that the topic occupies the top of the hot search list; "cliff shapes" are collective evacuations, where the hot search has played its "role" and received new tasks, charging towards new battlefields. In Figure 9, the peak of an event's popularity is exactly the trough of another event, down to the second, which must be a unified batch of water army receiving tasks and starting a new round of attacks. The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, some attracting attention, some responsible for science popularization, some stirring up trouble, some diverting attention, some affecting cognition, some misleading judgment, and some inciting emotions. Black industry accounts operate in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all elements of public opinion dissemination and expansion. Communication is a science. Without subjective factors such as position and emotion, even from objective data, black PR will be exposed. Wherever we go, we leave a trace behind. Let's dig up these traces together.
