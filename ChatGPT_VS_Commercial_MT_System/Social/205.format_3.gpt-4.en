Today, let's take a look at some "strange trending topics." What is normal public opinion? Let's randomly pick three hot searches: February 2nd, the Dragon Raising its Head, the price increase of Orion Confectionery, and the Huo Lala incident. Public opinion spreads and peaks, then the "index declines" (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, a small peak may reappear. They seem no different from the "online public opinion evolution model" once displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. What is abnormal public opinion? Let's randomly pick six hot searches from the same event, showing a "solitary peak," "serrated," and "cliff-like" pattern. A "solitary peak" is when people artificially heat up a topic, quickly making it a hot search and drawing public attention; a "serrated" pattern means periodically heating up the topic to ensure it remains on the hot search list; and a "cliff-like" pattern means a collective withdrawal after the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and received new tasks, moving on to new battlefields. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's popularity coincides precisely with the trough of another event, with no time difference. It must be the same batch of paid trolls receiving tasks and launching a new round of attacks. The professionalism of the black PR (public relations) industry is evident: dozens of hot searches are simultaneously on the list, some attracting attention, some providing information, some inciting conflict and creating momentum, some diverting attention, some influencing perceptions, some misleading judgments, some inciting emotions, and some affecting decision-making. Black market accounts operate in batches and at specific points, considering almost all elements of public opinion dissemination. Communication is a science. Putting aside positions, emotions, and all subjective factors, and looking only at objective data, the black PR industry will have nowhere to hide. Wherever one passes, traces are left behind. Let's uncover these traces together. Data source: Hot Search Time Machine.
