Look at some [strange hot topics] today. What is a normal public opinion? Randomly pick three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raising Head, Holliday's Price Increase, and Cargo Lala Incident, and the public opinion spreads to form a wave, then [exponential decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, and a small hump will appear again if secondary public opinion is generated. They look similar to the [evolution model of online public opinion] once shown on the official website of the Internet Information Office. What is an unusual public opinion? Six randomly selected hot searches in the same event show [solitary peak-like], [sawtooth-like], and [cliff-like]. The [lonely peak] is artificially heated, which quickly rushes to the top of the hot search list and attracts public attention; the [jagged tooth] is periodically heated, ensuring that the topic is coiled in the hot search list; the [cliff] is collectively withdrawn, and the hot search has finished its "function" and received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.  ... The specialization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for science, which lead to war to create momentum, which divert attention, which influence perception, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, which hostage decision, black production accounts in batches, sub-nodes of refined combat, taking into account almost all elements of the spread of public opinion. Communication is a science, put aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will also have nowhere to hide. All walks must leave traces, such traces, we dig out together. Data source: Hot Search Time Machine.
