What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs? In my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the questioner should be referring to LCD TVs. The main differences in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs are as follows: First, laser TVs focus more on the large screen market. Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TVs are products born for large screens. Currently, the mainstream size of LCD TVs is mostly between 55 and 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen color TVs. In recent years, the global shipment and sales ratio of laser TVs have been continuously increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above. According to Zhong Yikang's prediction, the sales growth of laser TVs in the market in 2020 will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth. The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection. Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly shoot into the eyes, which is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions compared to the backlight of LCD TVs, and produces less stimulation to the eyes. The Cybermart Laboratory of China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmic experts of Beijing Union Medical College Hospital conducted a rigorous comparative test of watching laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions, obtaining 144 sets of test data. The differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning? In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the poster should refer to LCD TV, and there are two main differences between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning: First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market. Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TVs are products born for large screens. Currently, the mainstream size of LCD TVs is mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest being over 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen color TVs. In recent years, the global shipment and sales ratio of laser TVs have been continuously increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales in the 80 inches and above category. According to Zhong Yikang's forecast, the sales growth of laser TVs in the market will exceed 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain a high growth rate. The reason for such good performance in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent eye protection performance of laser TVs. Based on the imaging principle of laser TV's diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eyeballs. Compared with the backlight of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is smaller. The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has certain improvement effects in specific aspects. In the current era when visual health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages but also opens up another breakthrough in the TV market. Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market. Unlike the continuous price reduction of LCD TVs, the prices of currently available laser TVs are mostly above 10,000 yuan, and prices gradually rise with the upgrade of size and light source. Why can laser TVs sell at such high prices? There must be a reason for it. With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve. With ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small and takes up little space. In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can achieve more than 2000 lumens. In addition, with lower heat generation, less equipment loss, and longer TV lifespan. In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies, such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, biomimetic screens, etc., which can bring users a more stunning audio-visual experience. It's not about fake demand, but rather a product of demand segmentation. In terms of image quality and return on investment, laser TVs may not be suitable for audio and video enthusiasts. If you want to balance a large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it out. Everything has advantages and disadvantages, and after weighing the pros and cons, you can make your own judgment. Just be careful not to believe everything you hear. In simple terms, the ultra-wide-angle short-throw projector -- laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which is not in line with the optimal optical design. In order to shield some ambient light, a microstructured Fresnel screen is used, which is expensive. The price of an 80-inch screen is basically equivalent to that of a 65-inch LCD. There is also one point that I particularly dislike about projector manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point for being good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. Even if you diffuse the light onto the ceiling, the eyes still cannot see it. Isn't the same true for turning on a TV and lighting up the ceiling? Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflected, it cannot become an image. The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is precisely what is being ignored. A large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle, and that is truly uncomfortable.
