What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs? To my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to LCD TVs. The main differences in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs are as follows: First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market. Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market, or it can be said that laser TVs are products born specifically for large screens. At present, the mainstream size of LCD TVs is between 55 and 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs. In recent years, the shipment and sales share of laser TVs in the global market has been continuously increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total sales of TVs with a size of 80 inches and above. According to the forecast by China Yi Kang, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140% in 2020, maintaining rapid growth. The reason for such good performance in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in terms of eye protection. Based on the diffuse reflection imaging principle of laser TVs, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eye. Compared to the backlight source of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the natural imaging process of objects, causing less irritation to the eyes. The China Electronics Standardization Institute's SAI XI Laboratory and eye specialists from Beijing Union Hospital conducted a strict comparison test between watching laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions, obtaining 144 sets of test data. The data confirms that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection features and even have certain improvement effects in specific aspects. As the importance of visual health is increasingly emphasized, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye protection advantages but also open up another breakthrough in the color TV market. Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market. In contrast to the continuously decreasing prices of LCD TVs, the prices of most laser TVs on the market are currently above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrading of size and light sources, the prices gradually increase. Why are laser TVs so expensive? There must be a reason. With the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve. With ultra-short-throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter compared to traditional projection equipment. They can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience within a short distance, requiring little space, and the main unit is compact, occupying a small area. In terms of brightness, big-brand laser TVs can achieve over 2,000 lumens. In addition, they have lower heat generation, less wear and tear on the equipment, and a longer service life for the TV. In addition to this, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and biomimetic screens, bringing users a more stunning audio-visual experience. It's not about false demand but rather a product of demand segmentation. In terms of image quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs may not be the choice for audio-visual enthusiasts. If you want to enjoy a large screen and have insufficient viewing environments, you can give it a try. Everything has its pros and cons, so weigh the options and make your judgment. Just be careful not to listen to one-sided opinions. In simple terms, ultra-wide-angle short-throw projectors—laser TVs—have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflective mirrors to get closer to the screen, which does not conform to the optimal optical design. To block part of the ambient light, they use microstructured Fresnel screens at a high cost. The price of an 80-inch screen could basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD. Another point I particularly dislike is when projector manufacturers use the advantage of diffuse reflection being good for the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse the light onto the ceiling, the eyes won't see it. If you want to be more specific, LCD TVs are also diffusely "direct" – doesn't the ceiling also get illuminated when you turn on the TV? Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it wouldn't form an image. The hot spot (light spot) effect of high-gain screens, where a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, has been overlooked, and that is truly uncomfortable.
