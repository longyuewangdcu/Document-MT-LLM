What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning? To my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to the LCD TV, and laser TV and LCD TV in the market positioning differences, mainly the following two points: First, laser TV more focused on the large screen market. Compared to the LCD TV full-scale market positioning, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen. At present, the mainstream LCD TV size more in 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of the laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, the largest more than 100 inches, fully meet the user demand for large screen color TV. In recent years, the laser TV in the global shipments and sales accounted for an increasing proportion of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above accounted for more than 60%. According to the forecast of CEC, in 2020, laser TV market sales growth will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain high growth. The reason for such good results in the large-screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection. Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted from the laser light source is not directly into the eye, compared to the backlight luminescence of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulus to the eyes is also smaller. China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute Sai Xi Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital ophthalmology experts, through the crowd under the same conditions to watch the laser TV and LCD TV rigorous comparison test, resulting in 144 sets of test data. The data confirms: laser TV does have strong eye-protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement in specific aspects. At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users by virtue of the eye protection advantage, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market. Second, the laser TV more focused on high-end market. In contrast to LCD TV prices continue to dip, the current price of commercially available laser TVs are mostly above 10,000 yuan, with the size and light source upgrades, the price gradually climb. What makes laser TV sell so expensive? There must be a reason. Under the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection can not achieve. With ultra-short focal length projection technology, laser TV projection distance is shorter compared to traditional projection equipment, to achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, the space required is not large, and the host is small, taking up very little space. In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens. Plus the heat generation is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the life of the TV is longer. In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience. Not to talk about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio-visual players, want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment is not enough, you can try, everything has its pros and cons, after weighing their own judgment can be, afraid to listen to one side of the story. Simply put, ultra-wide angle near focus projector - laser TV, in order to close to the curtain, had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lens and reflector, which does not meet the optical best design. In order to shield some of the ambient light, the use of micro-structured Fresnel curtains is costly, and the price of 80" can basically replace a 65" LCD. One more thing, I especially hate projection manufacturers to take diffuse reflection on the eyes as a selling point, come on, the eyes can see the light on the curtain for the eyes is direct light, you diffuse reflection to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, have to be serious LCD TV is also diffuse "direct", turn on the TV ceiling is not also illuminated? And, the projection curtain if not diffuse reflection, simply can not become like. Just ignored the high gain curtain hot spot (light spot) effect, a certain angle a lot of light reflected to the eyes, that is really uncomfortable.
