What are the differences in market positioning laser TV and traditional TV?	 From my understanding, the traditional TV that the subject said should refer to LCD TVs, and the differences between market positioning of laser TV and LCD TVs mainly include the following two points: First, laser TV focuses on the large screen market.	 Compared with the full market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TV obviously focuses on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of large screens.	 At present, the size of the mainstream LCD TV is mostly 55 -inch to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets users' needs for large screen color TVs.	 In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TV have been increasing, accounting for more than 60 % of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above.	 According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales of the laser TV market will grow more than 140%, which will continue to maintain a high -speed growth.	 The reason why there are such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.	 Based on the imaging principle of laser TV's mansion, the light emitted by the laser light source does not shoot directly into the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation of the eyes is also smaller.	 The China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute Saixi Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital Ophthalmology experts, through the same conditions of the crowd to watch the strict comparative test of laser TV and LCD TVs, obtained 144 groups of test data. Data confirmed that laser TVs do have strong eye protection characteristics, and even have a certain improvement in specific aspects.	 At the moment when vision health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracted more and more users with the advantages of eye protection, but also opened another breakthrough in the color TV market.	 Second, laser TV focuses on high -end markets.	 In contrast to the price of LCD TVs, the current price of commercial laser TVs is mostly more than 10,000 yuan. As the size and light source are upgraded, the price has gradually risen.	 Why does laser TV sell so expensive?	 It must be reasonable.	 Under the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser TVs have many advantages that can not be achieved by LCD TVs and projection.	 With ultra -short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100 -inch large -screen experience within a short distance. The required space is not large, and the host is small and the place occupies a small place.	 In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000.	 In addition, the heat is lower, the device is small, and the service life of the TV is longer. In addition, many high -end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting -edge technologies such as real 4K ultra -high -definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and bionic screen, which can bring more shocking audiovisual experiences to users.	 Do not talk about pseudo -demand, but the product of demand segmentation. On the quality of picture quality and input and output. Laser TV is not a dish for audiovisual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and the environment, you can try it. You can try it.	 If you can judge yourself, you are afraid of listening to the words.	 To put it simply, ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector-laser TV, in order to get closer to the curtain, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lens and reflectors, which is not in line with optical best design.	 In order to shield some environmental light, the micro -structured Fresnel curtain is costly, and the price of 80 -inch can basically change a 65 -inch LCD.	 Another point, I particularly hate the projection manufacturer's reflection on the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the curtain that can be seen by the eyes is to the eyes of the eyes.	 In this way, it is necessary to "direct" the LCD TV. Isn't it also illuminated on the TV ceiling?	 Moreover, if the projection curtain is not reflected, it will not be like it.	 It is just ignored the heat spots (light spots) effect of high -gain curtains. A large amount of light reflects the eyes at a certain angle is really uncomfortable.
