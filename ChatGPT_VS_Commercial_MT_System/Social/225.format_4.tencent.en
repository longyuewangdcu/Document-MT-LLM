What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning? In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to LCD TV, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning mainly includes the following two points:First, the laser TV is more focused on the large screen market. Compared with the market positioning of LCD TVs, the laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or the laser TV itself is a product for large screens. At present, the mainstream LCD TV size is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the laser TV size is generally above 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large screen color TVs. In recent years,Laser TV shipments and sales in the world are increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above. According to the forecast of Zhongyikang, the sales volume of laser TV market will increase by more than 140% in 2020, and continue to maintain rapid growth.The laser light source is not directly into the eyeball, compared with the LCD TV backlight light, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller. The data confirms that:Laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement in certain aspects. At a time when vision health is getting more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users by virtue of eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.With the development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection can not achieve. With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, which can achieve 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance.Large brand laser TV can reach more than 2000 lumens. In addition, the heat is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer. In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen, etc., which can bring more shocking audio-visual experience to users.Ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector-laser TV, in order to close to the screen, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lens and mirror, which does not meet the optical best design. In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of micro-structure Fresnel screen, expensive, 80-inch price can basically be replaced by 65-inch LCD. Another point, I particularly hate projection manufacturers to diffuse reflection on the eyes good for this kind of selling point, please,The light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes. You can diffuse it to the ceiling, and the eyes can't see it. If you want to be more serious, the LCD TV is also diffuse "direct". If you turn on the TV, the ceiling is not illuminated. Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it will not be like. It is precisely the neglect of the hot spot (spot) effect of the high-gain screen. A large amount of light is reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.
