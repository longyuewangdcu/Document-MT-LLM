Is it reliable for Xiao Yusan to buy insurance? Xiao Yusan is an internet insurance broker platform. According to the ""Regulations on the Supervision and Administration of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)"", in order to become an insurance brokerage company, three key criteria must be met: shareholders and initiators have no major violations in the past three years, the minimum capital requirement is RMB 50 million, and approval must be obtained from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC). These three criteria are actually very strict, and the summary is that strength is required, approval must be obtained from the national authoritative department of the CIRC that supervises insurance companies and banks, and shareholders must have good conduct. As an insurance brokerage company, Xiao Yusan Insurance does not need to be questioned about whether it is legitimate or not, because not all insurance companies can meet these three thresholds. In this respect, it is trustworthy. In terms of insurance products, Xiao Yusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurances are sold on this platform. For example, the newly launched HeTai Super Mario No.5 critical illness insurance is underwritten and claimed by HeTai Life Insurance, and Xiao Yusan Insurance is only a third-party intermediary. Therefore, its reliability is not in question. In terms of payment methods, internet platform products generally have a high price-performance ratio because they have lower operating costs and no salary costs for salespersons. Payment methods are flexible and support monthly payments, reducing the payment pressure on policyholders while maximizing the leverage of insurance. This aspect is still very good and worth considering. In terms of the professionalism of salespersons, this is particularly important because insurance is a highly specialized industry, and many internet products can be self-purchased by customers. This can lead to many misunderstandings, especially in terms of health and occupation information. Non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when purchasing insurance, believing that they are healthy or eligible, which can easily lead to many potential claim risks and the possibility of being denied. I myself used to work as a telephone salesperson for insurance at "Tencent Weibao" (like Xiaoyusan, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform). I want to responsibly tell everyone that internet insurance is genuine and reliable, but the issue lies with the people. Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are many instances of sales misguidance. For example, marketing strategies like 1 yuan for 6 million insurance coverage, buying insurance to get a free phone, and receiving 60,000 critical illness insurance coverage for free are not wrong, but they do not emphasize the details. They do not tell the policyholders that the first month is only 1 yuan, and the following months require normal fees ranging from tens to 200 yuan, so many customers who have been paying for one or two years do not know what they have bought. They think they can spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company will pay 6 million (a free lunch). The free phone is only given for special policy numbers like 6666 or 8888, and if the winning message is sent but not redeemed, there is no reminder for the policyholders. (This is another pitfall for the policyholders.) The free 60,000 critical illness insurance coverage is short-term and cannot solve the problem if only relied upon without other commercial insurances. If a real critical illness occurs, 60,000 yuan cannot solve the problem, and the policyholder's life will become exposed. Currently, the country is also cracking down on the deception in internet insurance sales. Therefore, overall, the platform and products are not problematic, but the issue lies with the professionalism and ethics of the salespeople. I suggest that the questioner carefully consider and weigh the options. In fact, many offline insurance brokers offer a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and options to choose from. The cost-effectiveness of some products is also better than that of internet products. I myself have helped 59 internet customers to underwrite offline products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan per year in insurance premiums. If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me. I am Mingya, an insurance broker with 3 years of enterprise management training experience, serving nearly a thousand corporate clients and cooperating with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will tailor insurance products based on customer needs. During the purchasing process, I will compare different options to strive for the best underwriting result for customers. After purchasing, I will handle policy organization and management, so that customers can have peace of mind. I hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner. According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance refers to insurance business that can be completed independently by the policyholder by clicking on the insurance application link. In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either. All steps can be completed independently by the policyholder. Although the purchase of insurance through the internet may lack a certain ""ceremony,"" and may not even have a printed paper contract, the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract is not affected. This kind of mode is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of ""telephone sales,"" but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, that is - the follow-up service may not be able to keep up. Insurance is usually a long-term contract that may last for decades. When purchasing insurance, should we carefully consider whether the ""intermediary"" we choose can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services in many years to come?
