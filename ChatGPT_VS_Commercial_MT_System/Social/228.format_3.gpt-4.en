Is buying insurance through Xiaoyusan reliable? Xiaoyusan is an online insurance brokerage platform. Based on the conditions set: According to the "Insurance Brokerage Supervision Regulations (revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key requirements must be met: shareholders and initiators must not have any significant violations within the past three years, a minimum capital of 50 million RMB is required to establish the company, and approval from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission is necessary. These three conditions are quite strict, which means that the company must be strong, approved by the national authority that supervises insurance companies and banks (CBIRC), and have shareholders with a good reputation. As an insurance brokerage company, policyholders don't need to worry too much about whether Xiaoyusan is legitimate, as not every insurance company can meet these three conditions. In this regard, it is quite good and trustworthy. In terms of insurance products: Xiaoyusan is like an insurance supermarket, with many companies selling their star critical illness insurance products on the platform, such as the recently launched Hetai Super Mario No. 5 critical illness insurance. Both the claims and underwriting sides are handled by Hetai Life Insurance, and Xiaoyusan is only a third-party intermediary, so its reliability should not be questioned. From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because they have lower operating costs for outlets and employee salaries, generally have a higher cost-performance ratio. They also offer flexible payment methods, supporting monthly payments to ease the pressure on policyholders while maximizing the leverage of insurance. This aspect is quite good and worth considering. Regarding the professional level of salespeople: This is particularly important because insurance is a highly specialized industry. Many internet product customers can purchase insurance themselves, which may lead to misunderstandings, especially in health disclosure and occupation. Non-insurance professionals often add their subjective judgment when purchasing insurance, thinking they are healthy or eligible, which can lead to potential claim risks and possible rejection of claims. I have personally worked as a telephone insurance salesperson on "Tencent Weibao" (similar to Xiaoyusan, also an online insurance brokerage platform) and can responsibly tell everyone that online insurance is indeed real and reliable. However, the unreliable factor is people, as there are many cases of sales misinformation in the online channels due to the lack of professional practitioners. For example: 1 RMB insurance covering 6 million RMB, buying insurance with a free mobile phone, and receiving a free 60,000 RMB critical illness coverage. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they tend to downplay important details. They won't tell the policyholder that after the first month of paying 1 RMB, they need to pay the normal rate which can vary from tens to 200 RMB. Many customers are unclear about the actual insurance they have purchased after being charged for a year or two. They might think that they can spend 1 RMB and the insurance company will pay 6 million RMB (as if a pie is falling from the sky). The free mobile phone offer applies to special policy numbers, like those ending with 6666 or 8888. If you receive a winning text message but don't claim the prize, nobody will remind you (which is a pitfall for policyholders). The free 60,000 RMB critical illness coverage is short-term, and if you rely solely on this without any other commercial insurance, it won't be enough to solve problems in case a critical illness occurs, leaving you exposed in the future. The government is currently cracking down on misleading online insurance sales practices. So, overall, there is no issue with the platform or the products. The real issue lies in the professionalism and ethics of the salespeople. I suggest that you consider this carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies offer a wider range of products, providing more opportunities and choices for customers. Some of their products may even have better cost-performance than online products. I have personally helped 59 internet customers underwrite offline products, saving each of them 2,000-3,000 RMB per year in premiums. If you have any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange ideas with me. I am a Mingya insurance broker with 3 years of experience in corporate management training. I have served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will customize insurance products for clients based on their needs. During the insurance process, I will help clients compare different options and strive to obtain the best underwriting results. After purchasing insurance, I will help clients organize and manage their policies, ensuring peace of mind. I aim to grow together with each client for a lifetime. I hope my answer can help you! According to the definition provided by the insurance regulatory department, online insurance is the type of insurance business where the policyholder can independently complete the entire insurance process after clicking on the insurance link. In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign anything, and neither does the insurance consultant. All steps can be completed by the policyholder independently. Although online insurance purchases may lack a sense of "ceremony" and might not even come with a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of the electronic contract. This mode is somewhat similar to the assembly line work of "telephone sales." However, there is a critical issue with purchasing insurance this way - the follow-up services might not keep up. Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting several decades. When buying insurance, shouldn't we carefully consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services even many years later?
