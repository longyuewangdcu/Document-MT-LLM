Is it reliable to buy insurance under a small umbrella? Little Umbrella is an Internet-based insurance brokerage platform. From the set-up conditions: according to the "Insurance Brokerage Institutions Supervision Regulations (2015 Revision)" tips, to become an insurance brokerage company, you must meet three key words: shareholders, the promoters of the last three years without major illegal records, the minimum limit of RMB 50 million to be established, and must be agreed by the CIRC. These three is actually very harsh, summed up is to have the strength, to be approved by the CBIRC (regulation of insurance companies, banks within the country) of the state authority, shareholders should have good style, as an insurance brokerage company of the small umbrella insurance, the insured is not too much to question the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these 3 thresholds, not what insurance companies can reach. At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy. From the point of view of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest on the shelves of Hetai Super Mary 5 critical illness insurance, claims and underwriters are Hetai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not need to question its reliability. From the point of view of the payment model: Internet platform products, because less business network operating costs, and the cost of salesmen's wages, so the Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and flexible payment methods, support for monthly payments, to reduce the pressure of the policyholder's payments, while you can maximize the leveraging of insurance. This is still a very good point. You can consider. From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesman: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very strong professionalism requirements of the industry, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, there will be a lot of misunderstandings, in the health information and occupation of this section, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when taking out insurance, think they are healthy or in line, so there are easy to have a lot of claims hidden danger, there may be The risk of denial of claims. I myself have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Little Umbrella, also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can tell you very responsibly. Internet insurance is real and reliable, but what is not reliable is the people, there are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are many misleading sales. For example: 1 yuan insurance to protect 6 million, buy insurance to send cell phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness coverage, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the important, will not tell the insured, the first month of 1 yuan, the next month is required to pay the normal charges, ranging from a few dozen to 200, many customers deducted a year or two of their own buy a what is not clear. Think you can spend 1 dollar, the insurance company to pay 6 million (the world fell pie). Free cell phones, is the policy tail number such as 6666, 8888 such special policy number to send, and if the winning SMS issued, they do not exchange, and no one to remind the. (This is another pit for the insured) free to receive 60,000 critical illness coverage, is a short-term, if only rely on this, no other commercial insurance, in case of a real serious illness, 60,000 can do, can not solve the problem, the future of life began to run naked. At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales. So a comprehensive view, the platform is no problem, the product is also no problem, there is a problem is the professionalism and professional conduct of the salesman. It is recommended that the subject consider carefully, in fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are better than the Internet products in terms of cost performance. I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting offline products, premium savings of 2,000-3,000 yuan each If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and exchange with me. I: Ming Ya insurance broker, have 3 years of experience in business management training, served nearly 1,000 corporate users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before the insurance, I will start from the customer needs, customized insurance products for customers, in the insurance, for customers to compare three, try to get the best underwriting results for customers, after the insurance, for customers to do policy organization, policy trust, so that customers rest assured worry-free. We will grow with each customer for life. I hope my answer can be of help to the subject! According to the definition of the insurance regulator, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can complete all the insurance process independently after clicking on the insurance link. In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign and the insurance consultant does not need to sign, all the steps can be done by the policyholder independently. Although the Internet insurance is not too "ritual", and may not even have a printed paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract. This model, which is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing", can be a fatal problem in buying insurance, and that is - the follow-up service may not be able to keep up. Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, so when we buy insurance, shouldn't we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that will be with us for a long time and provide services to us even after many years? Is it an "insurance intermediary" that will be with us for a long time and will provide us with services for many years?
