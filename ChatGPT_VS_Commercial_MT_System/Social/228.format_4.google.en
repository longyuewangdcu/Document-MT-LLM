Is it reliable to buy insurance? Little umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.	 From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015)", those who become insurance brokerage companies must meet three keywords: shareholders and sponsor have no major illegal records in the past three years, minimum limits of the lowest limit, minimum limit,	 It can be established for RMB 50 million and must be consent of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.	 These three items are actually very harsh. To sum up, it is necessary to have strength.	 The insured does not have to question whether the small umbrella insurance is regular or not. After all, there are three thresholds, not any insurance company can reach.	 At this point, it is not bad, it is trustworthy.	 From the perspective of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies 'stars' critical illness insurance is sold on this platform.	 For Heeta Life, Little Umbrella Insurance is just a third -party agency, without questioning its reliability.	 From the perspective of the payment model: the product of the Internet platform, because the operating expenses of the business outlets and the cost of the salary of the salesperson, the general cost -effectiveness of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the pressure of the insurer's payment pressure	 At the same time, you can pry the leverage of insurance to the greatest extent.	 This is still very good.	 Can consider it.	 Judging from the professionalism of the salesperson: This is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with a very strong professional requirement. Many Internet product customers can insure themselves. This will have a lot of misunderstandings.	 Non -insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when they are insured, and feel that they are healthy or consistent. This is easy to have many hidden dangers of claims and may be rejected. I have done insurance telephone sales on the "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like the small umbrella, but also the Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I will tell everyone very responsible.	 The insurance of the Internet is true and reliable. What is unreliable is people. The Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are many misleading sales.	 For example: 1 yuan insurance insurance 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, and receive 60,000 serious illness insurance amounts for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are lightly avoided, and they will not tell the insured.	 The charges ranged from tens to 200, and many customers deducted for a year or two to buy them. It is unclear.	 I thought it could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company compensated 6 million (piers in the world).	 Free mobile phone, which is only sent by the special insurance order number such as 66666,8888, and if the text message is sent, it will not be redeemed, and no one reminds it.	 (This is another pit for the insurer.) It is a short -term for a short period of time. It is a short -term. If you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance. What if you really have serious illness?	 No problem, the future life began to break naked.	 At present, the country is also severely cracking down on Internet insurance sales.	 Therefore, comprehensive point of view, the platform is no problem, and there is no problem with the product. What is the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.	 It is recommended that the main topics consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider product, more opportunities and products that customers can choose, and some products are more cost -effective than Internet products.	 I have helped 59 Internet customers, offline products, and premiums for each person to save 2000-3000 yuan/year. If you have any questions, please communicate and communicate with me.	 Me: Mingya Insurance Agent, with 3 years of corporate management training experience, serving nearly a thousand enterprise users, and more than 100 insurance companies in cooperation. Before the insurance, I will start from customer needs to tailor insurance products for customers.	 During the insurance, the customer is compared with three, and try to strive for the best underwriting results for customers. After the insurance is insured, the insurance policies are organized, and the policy custody will be kept at ease.	 Growing up with each customer for life.	 I hope my answer can help the subject!	 According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is the insurance business that can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking the insurance link.	 In the process, the insured does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the insured.	 Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a sense of "ritual", and may even have no printed paper contract, this does not affect the effectiveness and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract.	 This model is a bit similar to the "telephone sales" general assembly line operation, but there will be a fatal problem when buying insurance, that is, the subsequent service may not keep up.	 Insurance is usually a long -term contract for decades. When we buy insurance, should we think carefully? Is this "intermediary" we chose?	 Will the "insurance intermediary" provide us?
