Small umbrella to buy insurance, reliable? Small umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform. From the setting conditions:According to the tips of Regulations on Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015), to become an insurance brokerage company, three key words must be met:Shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the last three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and they must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. These three requirements are actually very harsh. To sum up, they must have strength, be approved by the national authority of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks across the country), and shareholders must have a good style of work. As a small umbrella insurance company of insurance brokerage companies,Insured people do not have to question too much whether small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these three thresholds, not what insurance companies can achieve. At this point, not bad, is trustworthy. From the perspective of insurance products:Small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies 'star serious illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest shelves and Thai Super Mary No.5 serious illness insurance, the claimant and insurer are Hetai Life Insurance, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not question its reliability. From the payment mode to see:Internet platform products, because less business outlets operating expenses, and the cost of salesman wages, so the Internet products generally cost-effective, and flexible payment methods, support monthly payment, reduce the pressure on the insured 's payment, while maximizing the leverage of insurance. This is still very good. Can be considered. From the perspective of salesman professionalism:This is particularly important, because insurance is a professional degree requirements very strong industry, many Internet product customers can insure themselves, this will have a lot of misunderstanding, in health notification and occupation this, non-insurance practitioners often in the insurance will add their own subjective consciousness, feel their health or conform, so easy to have a lot of claims hidden danger, may be refused The risk of compensation. I have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Micro Insurance"(like small umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible to tell you. Internet insurance is true, but also reliable, not reliable is people, Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, there are also a lot of sales misleading. For example:1 yuan insurance coverage of 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 serious illness insurance amount, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the important, will not tell the policyholder, the first month 1 yuan, the next month is required to charge according to the normal, dozens to 200, many customers deduct a year or two to buy what is not clear. Think you can spend 1 yuan, insurance companies compensate 6 million (the world lost pie). Free mobile phone, is the policy tail number such as 6666,8888 This special policy number segment is only sent, and if the winning SMS is sent, you don't redeem it, and no one reminds you.(This is another pit for the insured) Free 60,000 serious illness insurance amount, is short-term, if only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, 60,000 can not solve the problem, the future life begins to run naked. At present, the country is also cracking down on the misleading of Internet insurance sales. So, on the whole,There is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the products. What is problematic is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesmen. It is suggested that the subject should consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have wider products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are more cost-effective than Internet products. I have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, and each person saves 2000-3000 yuan/year. If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me. I:Mingya insurance broker, has 3 years of experience in enterprise management training, has served nearly 1,000 enterprise users, and has cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will start from the customer's needs and tailor insurance products for the customer. During insurance, I will shop around for the customer and try my best to strive for the best underwriting result for the customer. After insurance, I will arrange the insurance policy for the customer and entrust the insurance policy.The insurance industry is the world's largest insurance industry, and the world's largest insurance industry is the world's largest insurance industry. The world's largest insurance industry is the world's largest insurance industry, and the world's largest insurance industry is the world's largest insurance industry.There may not even be a printed paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract. This model is a bit similar to the assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but there is also a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up. Insurance is usually a long-term contract for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider it?Is the "intermediary" we have chosen an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and will provide us with services many years later?
