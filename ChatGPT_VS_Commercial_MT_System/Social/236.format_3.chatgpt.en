From the past until now, I have always opposed any form of defamation and verbal abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate these kind of scoundrels. Regardless of political parties or factions, what we need to resist first is this uncivilized behavior. From the moment you sent me a friend request on Facebook and posted teasing posts, to when you tried to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have already chosen not to respond. Afterwards, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating comments about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my appearance, figure, fertility, and even comments about strawberry planting in bed and whether or not to insert it... I couldn't take it anymore. Later, I received messages from multiple friends about your Facebook account, which contained a photo of you and sexually harassing comments. I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent. After the news of my report to the police was published, you didn't back down, but became even more arrogant. I don't care about your political background or your status, in our society, respect between genders is necessary. Yes, you can continue to make teasing, obscure, humiliating, and abusive comments, you can continue to say that you only care about and pay attention to me, you can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that you made the picture or continue to make any kind of attacking comments. That's right, I can't and don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need your comments. I don't even think any girl would be willing to be humiliated like this in exchange for fame. Friends asked me if I'm okay, I said I am, but you wouldn't believe me. I don't think any girl who has been bullied like this can say that they are okay. Only those who lack basic moral principles in work, society, politics, or business would choose to use this method to harm any woman. I believe that justice is in people's hearts. I have captured some of the messages and hope everyone can judge for themselves. No one should be able to impersonate you in the posts you made. I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization, which makes me smile bitterly.
