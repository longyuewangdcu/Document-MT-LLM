From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone accept such personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything except this kind of villain. If we do not consider political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style. Since you started sending me Facebook friend requests, then posting mocking posts, and even attempting to publish my home address and father's name on social media, I have adopted a non-responsive attitude. Later, you intensified your efforts, not only tagging me at the frequency of six meals a day but also continuing to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some obscure, humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, body, fertility, and inappropriate comments about intimacy. I...let it go. However, I later received messages from several friends about a photo of you and comments with sexual harassment elements on your Facebook friend's account. I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After the news of my reporting to the police was published, you did not restrain yourself but became even more arrogant. I don't care about your political background or your social status; in our society, respect between genders is required. Yes, you can continue with these mocking, obscure, humiliating, and abusive remarks; you can continue to say that you only care about and pay attention to me; you can continue to believe that it is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it was not your edited picture or continue to make any aggressive comments.From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone accept such personal attacks.

That's right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you, nor do I want to know you, and my appearance and body certainly don't need your judgment. I don't even think there is any woman who would be willing to endure such humiliation in exchange for fame. Friends ask me, are you okay? I say I'm fine, but you wouldn't believe it. I don't think any woman can say she's fine after being bullied like this. In work, society, politics, or business, only those without basic morals would choose to hurt any woman in this way. I believe that justice lies in the hearts of the people. I have captured some of the comments for everyone to judge. The posts you made yourself should not be impersonated by anyone, right? All I can say is that you are an enemy of civilization, and I can only smile knowingly.
