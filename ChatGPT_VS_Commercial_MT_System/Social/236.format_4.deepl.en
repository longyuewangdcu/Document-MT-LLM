From before to now, I am against any kind of slander and abuse, not to mention the unacceptability of such personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but it is this kind of villainy that must be eliminated. If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style. From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, to your flirtatious posts, to your attempts to post my alleged home location and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive attitude. You have since intensified your efforts not only to keep tagging me as often as six meals a day, but also to continue to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook with impudent and humiliating comments about me, my looks, my body, my fertility, my growing strawberries in bed, my need for penetration, etc. I... I didn't mind. But then I received a number of messages from friends about your Facebook friend account posting a picture of you and sexual harassment comments. I'm sorry, but as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore. After the news of me calling the police was published, you did not stop at all, but became more and more arrogant. I don't care what your political affiliation is, or what your status is, in our society, there is a need for respect for both genders. Yes, you can continue with the flirtatious, subtle, humiliating, abusive comments, you can continue to say that you are just caring and concerned about me, you can continue to argue that it is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that you made the picture or continue to make all the offensive comments. That's right, I can't and don't have the power to stop you. I neither know you, nor do I want to know you, and I don't need you to judge me for my looks and body. I don't even think any girl would be willing to let someone humiliate her so much in exchange for fame. My friend asked me how I was doing. You wouldn't believe me if I said yes. I don't think there is any girl who can say she is okay after being bullied like that. Whether at work, in society, in politics or in business, only those who don't even have basic moral character would choose to hurt any woman in this way. I believe that justice is in the eye of the beholder. I've cut off some of the messages for you to comment on your own posting there should be no one to impersonate you I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization will heartily smile
