I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept this kind of personal attack. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must stop this kind of villain. If you don't look at political parties and factions, you must first resist this kind of uncivilized style. From the beginning of your Facebook friend request, to the teasing post, to the attempt to post my so-called home location and father's name on social media,I have already adopted an attitude of not responding. After that, you intensified your efforts not only to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, but also to continue to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, such as appearance, figure, good fertility, planting strawberries in bed, whether to insert or not,I ... forget it. I didn't know that I would receive more messages from many friends about your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you and sexual harassment. I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't keep silent any longer. After the news of my police report was uploaded, you didn't restrain yourself at all. Instead, you became even more arrogant. I don't care what political background you have or what status you have. In our society, you need to respect both sexes. Yes,You can continue to make this kind of teasing, veiled, humiliating, abusive remarks, you can continue to say that you just love and pay attention to me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that you did not make the picture or continue to make all kinds of offensive remarks. That's right, I can't and can't stop you. I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to judge my appearance or my body. I don't even think any girl would want to be humiliated like this in order to be famous. My friend asked me,"Are you okay?" I said yes, and you wouldn't believe me. I don't think any girl could be bullied like this and still say she's okay. Whether in work, society, politics or business,Only those who do not even have the basic moral character, will choose to use this way to hurt any woman. I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people. I intercepted some of the messages to everyone to comment on your own posts should no one can impersonate you All I can say is that you're the enemy of civilization
