On January 17, 2022, the pro-Chinese media outlet, Duowei, reported the latest news on China-US relations. According to the report, the latest satellite images show that three American aircraft carriers are gathering around China's periphery. American media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal, made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to both allies and opponents in the Indo-Pacific region. According to the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" think tank, on January 9th, a satellite discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait. The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific. The platform predicts that the USS Carl Vinson will be deployed to the South China Sea. This is the first time the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier has deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey transport planes. In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US Navy currently has the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which departed from the US on January 3rd, and is now cruising in the Pacific with its first F-35C fighter squadron. The squadron belongs to the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron. In addition to these two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan is also deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, which is currently docked in Yokosuka, Japan. The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the USS Shiloh missile cruiser and the USS Stockdale missile destroyer.

On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US naval transport aircraft CMV-22B was disclosed. (Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to CNN's report on January 17, the US Navy's one of the most powerful weapons, the Ohio-class nuclear-powered submarine USS Nevada, which carries 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, visited the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15). Analysts said this move sent a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region. This is the first time a US ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second time it has publicly visited Guam since the 1980s. China has built a large number of military facilities on the South China Sea islands in recent years. The picture shows China's Yongshu Reef in the South China Sea. (South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy stated in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam has strengthened cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, demonstrated the US's ability, flexibility, and readiness, as well as its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Ballistic missile submarines are usually called "boomer submarines". The whereabouts of the 14 "boomer submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential. The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made them the "most important survival weapon" in the "nuclear triad" system, which also includes land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 capable of carrying nuclear warheads, located within the continental United States.
