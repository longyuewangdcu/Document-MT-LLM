Three US Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China; Most Powerful Weapon Makes Rare Visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Duowei Pro-China media Duowei reports: The latest news on China-US relations: new satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China. US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending important signals to both allies and adversaries of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region. According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform," on January 9th, a satellite spotted the USS Carl Vinson near the Balabac Strait. The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific. The platform predicts that the Carl Vinson will be deployed in the South China Sea. This is the first time the Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft. In addition to the Carl Vinson, the US aircraft carriers currently patrolling the Pacific include the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3rd. The Lincoln is also carrying an F-35C carrier-based squadron for the first time, which belongs to the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron. Apart from the aforementioned two carriers, the US Navy has the USS Ronald Reagan deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, currently docked at Yokosuka, Japan. The carrier battle group also includes the USS Chancellorsville missile cruiser and the USS Stockdale missile destroyer, among others. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing three US aircraft carriers gathering around China.

(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to a CNN report on January 17th, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam over the weekend. The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base in Guam on Saturday, January 15th. Analysts say this sends a signal to both allies and adversaries in the increasingly tense Indo-Pacific region. This is the first visit of a US ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to the island since the 1980s. In recent years, China has built numerous military facilities in the Spratly Islands. The image shows China's Yongshu Island in the Spratly Islands (South China Sea Research Forum). In a statement, the US Navy said the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, demonstrating US capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines." The whereabouts of the 14 Boomer submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential. The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes "Boomer submarines" the most important survivable weapon in the nuclear triad, which also includes silo-based ballistic missiles located in the continental United States and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
