Talking with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock price, causing a $251 billion market cap loss. Zuckerberg responded that they are facing unprecedented competition. Why? Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with most of its revenue coming from advertising. As a company that makes money from advertising, Meta has its own traffic channels, including Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and more. Regardless of the specific features of these platforms, they all serve as Meta's traffic channels. Moreover, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps rely on Meta's advertising platform for monetization. However, times have changed. First, due to Apple's privacy policy changes, Meta is finding it difficult to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement. Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly and clearly prompts users whether to allow apps to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is not to allow it. If Google makes another move, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater. Second, the China factor that previously contributed to Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (although it's uncertain how much this factor weighed). As we all know, Meta does not have business operations in China, but this understanding is not entirely accurate. Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing overseas business. Meta has a few hundred employees in its Hong Kong office and several major agents in mainland China. For Chinese companies looking to expand into overseas markets, Meta is an indispensable advertising channel, and most of the money spent on advertising goes to Meta. Interestingly, ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years. All of ByteDance's agents in China were helping to place ads on Meta's platforms, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region was also good. I haven't looked into this recently, but it definitely won't be better than before. The stage of Chinese companies burning a lot of money overseas has passed. Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth. Facebook is getting older, and new platforms like TikTok are not in Meta's hands. The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth prospects. Capital markets not only value revenue but also place greater emphasis on future expectations. Obviously, Meta's expectations are insufficient. In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the ""metaverse."" The metaverse is indeed one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years. Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta. Although Facebook is now very popular and generates $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue annually, in fact, Facebook is very crisis-aware. Compared with other Internet and high-tech companies, it does not have good security moats. Although its several social software have high daily activities and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook also has no confidence in the face of TikTok's rapid development. The upheaval is just a matter of blinking. The concept of the metaverse is unattainable in the short term, and there is no hope of success. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg keeps changing the company's name and constantly seeking new tracks. However, I think his track choice is wrong, and it is a road of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
