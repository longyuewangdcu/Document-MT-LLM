Talking with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock, a market value evaporation of 251 billion dollars, Zuckerberg responds, "facing unprecedented competition." What's the reason? Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its main revenue coming from advertisements. Today's profitable advertising companies have their own traffic channels. Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., regardless of their functional positioning, are all traffic channels for Meta. Not only that, but Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance"; many apps connect to Meta's ads, and monetization is realized through Meta's advertising platform. However, times have changed. First, due to Apple's privacy policy adjustments, it has become difficult for Meta to obtain user data, affecting the efficiency of ad placements. Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether they allow apps to access their information, and most people's natural reaction is not to allow it. If Google takes further action, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater. Second, the China factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it indeed exists). People usually know that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate. At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing overseas business. Meta has an office in Hong Kong with about a few hundred employees, and there are several major agencies in mainland China. When Chinese companies want to expand into overseas markets, Meta is an indispensable advertising channel, with most of the funds being spent on Meta. Interestingly, ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made quite a bit of money from ByteDance in the past couple of years. Various domestic agencies have been helping ByteDance place ads on Meta's platform, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region has been quite good. I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before. The phase of Chinese companies spending massively overseas has passed. Third, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth. Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TikTok, are not in Meta's hands. The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth prospects. Capital markets not only value revenue but also place greater importance on future prospects. Clearly, Meta's prospects are insufficient. In order to present a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "metaverse". The metaverse indeed should be one of the future directions, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long. This story probably won't be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years. So, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta. Although Facebook appears to be doing well now, with annual revenues of 100 to 200 billion US dollars, the company actually has a strong sense of crisis. Compared to other internet companies and high-tech firms, it lacks a good and secure moat. Although its social media platforms, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, have high daily active users and are mainstream social media apps, they face the rapid growth of TikTok, and Facebook doesn't have much confidence. The disruption could happen in the blink of an eye. Pursuing the metaverse, a concept that seems out of reach, has no hope of success in the short term, making Facebook very vulnerable. This is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and is constantly looking for new tracks to compete in. However, I think his choice of track is wrong and is a dead-end path. The above are some of my thoughts, for reference.
