Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of function positioning, all are Meta's traffic channels. Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps are connected to Meta's ads to realize cash through Meta's advertising platform. However, the times have changed. First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get the data information of users, which affects the efficiency of ad placement. Apple's privacy policy is very user-friendly now, and will obviously prompt users whether to allow the App to get their own information. The next stab from Google will have an even greater impact on Meta's revenue. Second, the China factor, which used to be part of Meta's revenue growth, has been weakened (not sure how much, but it's there). We all know that Meta has no business in China, but this is not an accurate understanding. Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, which is mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing business overseas; Meta's office in Hong Kong has about a few hundred people, and there are several major agencies in mainland China. It is interesting to note that byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta has made a lot of money from byte in the past two years. All the domestic agencies are helping Byte to advertise with Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good. I haven't looked into it recently, but it's definitely not better than before. The stage of Chinese companies burning money in overseas has passed. Third, new traffic channels are not expanding smoothly. facebook is getting old, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands. The biggest problem is not just a decline in revenue, but a lack of growth expectations. The capital market is not only interested in revenue, but also in future expectations. It was clear that Meta's expectations were not enough. In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "meta-universe". Meta-universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of Meta-universe is rather long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years. So the next two years should be a relatively difficult period for Meta. Don't look at Facebook now is very beautiful, also has 100 billion to 200 billion dollars of revenue every year, in fact Facebook now is very strong sense of crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat. Although his several social software is now a relatively high daily activity, but also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but the face of tiktok's rapid development, Facebook also has little confidence, subversion between the blink of an eye. And engage in the meta-universe this unattainable concept, a short period of time there is absolutely no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg and change the name of the company, and constantly looking for a new track the fundamental reason, but I think his track selection is wrong, is a road of no return The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
