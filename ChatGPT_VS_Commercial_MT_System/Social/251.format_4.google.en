Talking to friends about Meta recently plummeted 26%, and the market value evaporated at $ 251 billion. Zuckerberg responded to "facing unprecedented competition." Why?	 Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, which mainly comes from advertising. Today, advertising companies that make money today have traffic channels.	 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. No matter what functional positioning, it is Meta's traffic channel.	 Not only that, META is still the biggest "advertising alliance", many APPs are connected to META advertisements, and the advertising platform of META is realized.	 But the times have changed.	 First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get the user's data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.	 Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it will obviously indicate whether users allow the APP to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reactions are definitely not allowed.	 Next, if Google has another knife, the impact of Meta's income will be even greater.	 Second, the Chinese factors in the income growth of META have also weakened (the proportion of this factor is not sure how high it is, but it does exist).	 Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate. At least 10%of META's income from Meta each year, it is mainly contributed by China's company's company.	 There are about hundreds of Meta's office in Hong Kong, and there are still several major agents in the mainland.	 If Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that can't be bypassed. Most of the money burned has given Meta.	 Interestingly, the TT of bytes now is one of the main competitors of Meta, but the previous two years of Meta can make a lot of money from the byte.	 Various domestic agents in China are used to advertise in META, and the performance of Meta Greater China is also very good.	 I have not specially understood recently, but it is definitely not better than before.	 The stage of Chinese companies in large -scale overseas burning money has passed.	 Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.	 Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms including TT are not in the hands of Meta.	 The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations. The capital market is not only fancy revenue, but more importantly, it depends on the future expectations.	 Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough.	 In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg tells the "Yuan Universe". The Yuan universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the Yuan universe is relatively long. This story should not be enough in the past two or three years.	 Support the market value of Meta.	 So in the next two years, it should be a difficult period for META.	 Don't look at Facebook's very beautiful scenery now. There are also 100 billion to $ 2,000 billion in income each year. In fact, Facebook is now very crisis. Compared with other Internet companies and high -tech companies, there is no good and safe moat.	 Although several of his social software is now relatively high, it is also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of TIKTOK, Facebook has no confidence, and the subversion is the blink of an eye.	 And the concept of being expected to be expected to be in the Yuan universe has no hope of success within a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg is replaced by the company's name, and it is constantly looking for it.	 The fundamental reason for the new track, but I think his track selection is wrong, and it is some of my thoughts above the way to reference.
