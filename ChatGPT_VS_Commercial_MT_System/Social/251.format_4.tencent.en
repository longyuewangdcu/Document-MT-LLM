Talking to friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta and the loss of $251 billion in market value, Zuckerberg responded that "there is unprecedented competition". Why?(Former Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, revenue mainly comes from advertising, today 's profitable advertising companies, they have traffic channels. Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are Meta traffic channels. Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising network", many App external Meta ads,Meta 's advertising platform is to realize monetization. However, times have changed. First, because of the adjustment of Apple' s privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users 'data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising. Apple' s current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it will obviously prompt users whether to allow App to obtain their own information. Most people 's normal reaction is definitely not allowed. If Google stabs another knife,The impact on Meta 's revenue will be even greater. Second, the China factor in Meta' s previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist). Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate. Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing offshore business. Meta's office in Hong Kong is about a few hundred people, and there are several major agents in the mainland. Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to Meta. Interestingly, byte TT is now one of Meta's main competitors.However, Meta made a lot of money from Byte in the past two years. Various domestic agencies are helping Byte to advertise with Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good. I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it's definitely not better than before. The stage of China companies burning money on a large scale overseas has passed. Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going well. Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms including TT,The biggest problem is not just falling revenues, but a lack of growth expectations. The capital market is not only interested in income, but more importantly, what is expected in the future. Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough. In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg talked about the "meta-universe". The meta-universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the meta-universe is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support the market value of Meta in the next two or three years. So in the next two years,It should be a difficult time for Meta. Although Facebook is very prosperous now, with annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars, in fact, Facebook is now very strong sense of crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat. Although several of his social software are now relatively high daily life, but also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of tiktok,Facebook is also not very confident, subversion between the blink of an eye. And the concept of the universe is elusive, there is no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company, but also constantly looking for a new track of the fundamental reasons, but I think his track choice is wrong, is a road of no return Above are some of my thoughts, for reference.
