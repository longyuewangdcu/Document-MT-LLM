I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't stick with it, so I want to find a racket with a similar price to practice first. In fact, the price is often proportional to the friendliness level. If you can't tell the difference, the more expensive rackets are usually friendlier than the cheaper ones. These "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial junk. They have low strength and vibrate a lot when the ball hits the racket. Hard balls are difficult to handle, even for experts. Their logic and implication is that tennis is so difficult, they know you won't learn it, and they know you won't be willing to buy expensive ones. They sell you a cheap one to fool you. You'll play with it twice and won't play again. This way, the racket is cheap and you won't feel bad. When you can really tell the difference between good and bad rackets, it means you've made progress, and then you can come to me to buy an expensive one, and I'll make money twice. I suggest spending a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand, slightly better racket, such as Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough to sell expensive rackets, and new rackets priced at 500-600 are already good enough. Second-hand rackets cost around 200 yuan. Isn't it great to enjoy the experience of a thousand-yuan racket? It's friendly for beginners, but it becomes worthless once you pass the beginner stage. However, most people, especially girls, can't pass the beginner stage.
