I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't stick with it, so I want to find a racket with a reasonable price to practice. However, it's not user-friendly; in fact, the price is often positively correlated with the friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the more expensive rackets are usually friendlier than the cheaper ones. These "entry-level" rackets are actually industrial waste. They have low intensity, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is significant, and they can't withstand hard balls. Even skilled players find it difficult to control them. Their existence and underlying message is that tennis is so difficult, they know you won't learn it and that you won't be willing to buy expensive rackets, so they deceive you with cheap ones. You'll play a couple of times and then give up, so the racket is cheap, and you won't feel bad about it. When you can really tell the difference in quality, it means you've improved, and you can come back and buy an expensive one, so they make money twice. It's recommended to spend a similar amount of money on a better-quality used racket, like Prince or Dunlop. These two brands don't have enough fame, so their good rackets don't sell for high prices. A new one for 500-600 is good enough, and a used one for 200 will give you the enjoyment of a thousand-yuan racket. It's friendly for beginners, but once you're past the beginner stage, it becomes useless. However, most people, especially women, don't get past the beginner stage.
