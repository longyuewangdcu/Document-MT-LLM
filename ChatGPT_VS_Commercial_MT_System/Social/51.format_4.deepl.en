I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a similarly priced racket to practice with first. Not friendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can not tell, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap racket, this kind of "starter racket" is actually industrial waste. They have very low strength, and when the ball hits the top of the racket, the vibration is very high, the hard ball can't be topped, and it is very difficult for the expert to manage. The logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so difficult, know that you can not learn, also know that you do not want to buy expensive, make a cheap to fool you, you play twice, will not play again, so this racket is cheap, you do not feel pain. When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, that you progress, then come back to me to buy the expensive, I earn money twice. It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince, or Dunlop's, these two brands are not famous enough, so good racket also can not sell on the price, new racket 500, 600 is very good, second-hand 200, have a thousand dollars racket enjoyment does not smell? It is quite friendly to newcomers, but once the novice stage is chicken, but most people, especially girls, can not pass the novice stage.
