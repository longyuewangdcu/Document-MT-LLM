I want to try the tennis, but I am afraid that I can't hold on, so I want to find a similar price to practice.	 Not friendly. In fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendship. If it cannot be distinguished, the normal normal situation will be friendly than cheap slabs. Such "entry shooting" is actually industrial garbage.	 They are very low. The ball hit the shot, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't stand, and it is difficult for masters to control.	 The logic and subtext they exist are that the tennis is so difficult. Knowing that you can learn, you are not willing to buy expensive, and make a cheap goods and fool you. If you play twice, you will not play again.	 This beat is cheap, and you don't feel bad.	 When you can really distinguish the good or bad, it means that you have improved. When you come to me to buy expensive, I make two money.	 It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second -hand racket, and choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are enough to be famous, so good rackets can not sell the price. The new shooting 500, 600 is good, second -hand ones are very good. The second -hand ones are very good.	 200 yuan to enjoy a thousand yuan shots?	 It is very friendly to novices, but after the novice stage, it will be chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.
