I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to keep it up, so I wanted to find a similar price to practice. Not friendly. In fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't tell, then the expensive racket will be more friendly than the cheap racket. This kind of "entry racket" is actually industrial garbage. They are very low intensity. The ball hits the racket and the vibration is very strong. The hard ball can't withstand it.Tennis is so hard to master. The logic and subtext of their existence is---tennis is so difficult, I know you can't learn, and I know you don't want to buy expensive ones. I make a cheap one to fool you. You play it twice, you won't play it again. This way, the racket is cheap and you don't feel bad. When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you've made progress. When the time comes, come back to me to buy expensive rackets, and I'll make money twice. I suggest you spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince,Or Dunlop's, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets can not sell the price, the new shoot 500,600 is very good, second-hand 200 yuan, with a thousand yuan to enjoy not fragrant? Very friendly to the novice, but a novice stage on the chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, can not pass the novice stage.
