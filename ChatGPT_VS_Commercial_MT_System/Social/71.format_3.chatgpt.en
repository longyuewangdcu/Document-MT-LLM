What was the hottest trend in 2021? Undoubtedly, it was the Tokyo Olympics. Did you think that only Olympic athletes can win awards? Recently, an article titled "Quick Look! Project Managers Can Compete for Olympic Gold Medals" went viral, which mentioned that project managers can take the lead in many projects and no one can match them: doing laborious work, going on business trips, and staying up late are all part of a project manager's daily routine, while putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are just the norm. Although this article seemed like a joking remark, it also revealed the daily hardships of project managers and represented their powerlessness in current project management work. Project managers have gradually chosen to take action to overcome their work difficulties. According to the "20 Years of Development of Chinese Project Management (1999-2019)" report, as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® examination applicants in China was nearly 600,000, the number of certified PMP® holders was approximately 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide. The number of PMP certified personnel has increased year by year in the past decade, which indicates that more and more project managers have realized that relying on simple application of past "old experience" to do things is no longer feasible. The constantly changing work environment has taught us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the path forward. However, does obtaining a PMP certification guarantee unobstructed project management work? "Many novice project managers have expressed that by studying related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically grasp the ten major areas and five process groups of project management and other related knowledge points, but when they actually engage in project management work, they still feel confused. Many project managers often give feedback on the following issues: inadequate understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theories but not knowing how to practice; lacking support from systematic project management processes and systems, unable to implement work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and repeated delays in projects; unclear division of labor among team members, and ""old hands"" in the team do not know how to deal with it; cross-departmental communication is not smooth, making it difficult to advance the project... Therefore, with a focus on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has won honors such as ""China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base"", has brought the ""R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp"" online course. The ""R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp"" is an online fragmented learning method that combines practical cases, tools, and methods of many R&D-oriented companies to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the path to advanced project management. It is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the cultivation of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operational results to the enterprise. Don't just take our word for it, you can first see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only explained in-depth by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly the Huawei R&D management team), combining international advanced project management methodology and numerous well-known corporate real business scenarios. It also provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms to help students transform what they learn in the course into practical work."
