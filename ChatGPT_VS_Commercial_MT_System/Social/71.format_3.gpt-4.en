What was the hottest thing in 2021? Without a doubt, it was the Tokyo Olympics. Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards? A while ago, a popular article titled "Look! Olympic Events Where Project Managers Can Compete for Gold Medals" mentioned that project managers can absolutely take the lead in many projects, unmatched by others: moving bricks, going on business trips, and staying up late are daily routines for project managers, while putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are just a part of the job. This seemingly joking and sarcastic article actually reveals the daily hardships of project managers, reflecting their struggles in current project management work. People working in project management are increasingly choosing to take action to free themselves from work-related predicaments. The annual increase in the number of PMP (Project Management Professional, an internationally recognized certification) registrations shows that more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning. According to the "China Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019)," as of September 2019, there were nearly 600,000 cumulative PMP exam registrants nationwide, with about 420,000 PMP-certified individuals and approximately 300,000 valid certificate holders, accounting for 31.2% of the global total number of PMP-certified professionals. The number of PMP-certified individuals has increased year by year in the past decade, indicating that more and more project managers realize that simply copying past "old experiences" is no longer feasible. The rapidly changing work environment teaches us that we need to learn, stand on the shoulders of scientific giants, and explore the path forward. However, does obtaining a PMP certification guarantee smooth project management work? Many project management beginners have said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the knowledge points of the ten major domains and five process groups of project management. However, when it comes to actually managing projects, they still find themselves in a fog. Many project managers often report the following issues: inadequate understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, possessing project management theory but not knowing how to put it into practice; lacking systematic project management processes and support, unable to implement them in their work, inaccurate project estimates, poor control sensitivity, and projects being constantly delayed; unclear division of labor among team members, not knowing how to deal with the "old hands" in the team; poor cross-departmental communication and collaboration, making it difficult for projects to progress. Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on product innovation and R&D management for over a decade and has helped many outstanding enterprises train a large number of product managers, project managers, and other key R&D personnel, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base," is launching the "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course. This online course offers a fragmented learning approach, combining numerous practical cases, tools, and methods from R&D-oriented enterprises to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project management and advance in your own project management journey. It also provides an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, bringing about efficient operational results. Don't just take our word for it. You can see how other students evaluate the course: The course is not only delivered by the expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (formerly Huawei R&D management team), combining international advanced project management methodologies and real business scenarios from many well-known enterprises for in-depth and easy-to-understand professional explanations of the course content. It also provides practical and scientific management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms, to help students apply what they have learned to their specific work after the course.
