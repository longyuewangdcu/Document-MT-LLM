Claimed to have the loudest exhaust sound in the New Shan area! This time our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men! It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4! Priced at nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, with an annual road tax of over ten thousand Malaysian Ringgit, four-wheel drive, and why is it called LP700? Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is? Well, I don't know, but the data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which is probably when my Myvi (a type of car) reaches 30km/h, they have already reached 100km/h, hmm. The low and sleek body, the bold scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine visible under the glass, perfectly exemplify the style of Lamborghini. There is no need to say too much about the car model, just Google it yourself, and I have compiled some explanations that Google may not provide! It's too much of a spectacle, everyone is watching wherever you go, it's uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of awesome) The fuel cost for 1 km is around RM1 (car owners don't care). You need to practice the posture for getting in and out of the car, otherwise it may be a bit awkward (because you might get stuck halfway while trying to climb out of the cabin). The engine sound is too loud, and you will suddenly become deaf after getting out of the car. (But it's still awesome) The body of the car is too big, and it will be very narrow to park in a regular parking space. I'm afraid that the car next door will hit it when opening their door! It's a bit lonely because there are no opponents on the road (the editor said this, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha). Please don't misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry! Friends who want to shoot videos for their own cars are welcome to contact us!

Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the million-dollar range! Recently, in just a few minutes, a million-dollar Porsche 911 and a ten-million-dollar Chiron were crashed in a foreign country! Looking at the results, it's reasonable that it's expensive!
