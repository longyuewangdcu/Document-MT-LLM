Touted as the loudest supercar exhaust in the new mountain area! This time, our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men! It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4! Priced at nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, with an annual road tax of tens of thousands of Ringgit, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700? Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast that is? Well, I don't know either, but the data says it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100 km/h, which is about the time my Myvi takes to reach 30 km/h when others are already at 100 km/h, hmm. The low-slung body, aggressive scissor doors, massive air intakes all around, and the unobstructed view of the 6.5 V12 engine under the glass perfectly embody the Lamborghini style. There's not much need to say about the car's features; you can just Google it. I've compiled some explanations that Google may not provide! It attracts too much attention, and everyone looks wherever you go, making it uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of cool) The fuel cost for 1 km is around RM1 (the car owner doesn't really care). Practice getting in and out of the car, or it might be a bit embarrassing (because you might not be able to climb out of the cockpit and get stuck halfway). The engine noise is so loud that you may suddenly go deaf after getting out of the car. (But it's still very exhilarating) The car is so large that parking in a regular parking space feels narrow, and you're afraid of being hit by the neighboring car's door when they open it! It's a bit lonely because there are no rivals on the road (I say this myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha). Please don't misunderstand; the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry! If you want to shoot a video for your beloved car, feel free to contact us!

I believe car enthusiasts are familiar with both the Chiron, one of the world's most expensive supercars, and the Porsche 911, which is also priced in the millions! The other day, in just a few minutes, a million-dollar sports car, the 911, and a ten-million-dollar supercar, the Chiron, were wrecked in a foreign country! Looking at the outcome, there's a good reason for the high price!
