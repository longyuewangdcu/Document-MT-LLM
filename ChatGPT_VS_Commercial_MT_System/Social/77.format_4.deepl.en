No. The new mountain supercar exhaust sound maximum! This time our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men! It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4! That forget I do not know, the data said 0-100km Get on and off the posture to practice a little, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because it will not be able to climb out of the cabin and then stuck half) the engine sound is too big, get out of the car will suddenly deaf. (But still very cool) The body is too big, parked in a normal parking space will be very narrow, very afraid of being knocked to the next car when opening the door! A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (I speak for myself, not related to the owner, haha) Do not misunderstand, this video of the supercar is not for sale, sorry! Want to shoot video for your car friends, welcome to contact us! More information on cars you didn't know about in The Car Guide Look at the results, expensive for a reason!
