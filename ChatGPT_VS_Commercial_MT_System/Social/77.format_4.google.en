Known as the largest sound of supercars in Johor Bahru!	 This car brought to everyone this time is the dream of many men!	 It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, Murcielago's replacement model-Aventador LP700-4!	 The price is nearly two million, the road tax is more than ten thousand a year, and the four -wheel drive, why is it called LP700?	 Because of 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast you are?	 I do n’t know if the editor is not known. The data says that the 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds. It is probably that the Myvi of Xiaobian will only reach 100km/h when it will only be 30km/h. Hmm.	 The low body, arrogant scissors doors, huge air intakes around the body, and 6.5 V12 engines that have a glance at the glass perfectly interpret Lamborghini's style.	 There is no need to say too much about the instructions of the model, just google for your own. Xiaobian has compiled some commentary that Google may not give!	 Too much attention, everyone is watching wherever you go, very uncomfortable!	 (Actually it is a bit cool) 1km oil money is around RM1 (the owner does not care at all) Practice the posture of getting on and off, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing (because it will not climb out of the cabin and then get half of it) The engine will be too loud, and it will be deaf after getting off the car.	 (But it's still cool.) The body is too large, and it will be very narrow in the ordinary parking space. I am afraid that it will be knocked when it is opened by the car next door!	 It's a bit lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (the editor said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha), don't misunderstand, the supercar of this video is not sold, sorry!	 Friends who want to shoot videos for your car, welcome to contact us!	 More car information you do n’t know, just the car guide / people ’s car history involves a car accident worth 10 million!	 Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that riders know it. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also a million level!	 A few days ago, in just a few minutes, I hit a million sports car 911 and there were ten million super running Chiron! Looking at the results, it makes sense!
