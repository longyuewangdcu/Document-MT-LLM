The Aventador LP700-4 is Lamborghini 's flagship supercar, the replacement model of Murcielago. The asking price is nearly RM 2 million, and the annual road tax is RM 10,000. The four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700? Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is? Forget it, I don't know.The data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, which is probably when the small series myvi is only 30km/h, it is 100km/h, um. The low body, the arrogant scissors door, the huge air intake around the body and the 6.5 v12 engine under the glass are the perfect interpretation of the Lamborghini style. There is no need to say too much about the description of the car, just Google it yourself.Small editor sorted out some Google may not give to the commentary! Too much attention, go where everyone is watching, very uncomfortable!(In fact, a little cool)1km gas money in RM1 or so (car owners do not care) You need to practice getting on and off, otherwise it 'll be a little awkward(Because you can't climb out of the cabin and get stuck in half) The engine is too loud and you will be deaf when you get out of the car.(But still very cool) The car body is too big, parking in the ordinary parking space will be very narrow, I am afraid of being knocked by the car next door when opening the door! A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the roadBugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that car friends know that Chiron is one of The most expensive supercars in the world.The Porsche 911 was also priced at millions! That day, in just a few minutes, a million sports cars and a million supercar Chiron were knocked out in foreign countries! Look at the results, expensive is justified!
