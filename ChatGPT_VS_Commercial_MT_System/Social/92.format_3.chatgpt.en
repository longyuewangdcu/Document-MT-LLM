"At the time when NFTs were quickly becoming popular, a new concept emerged in the cryptocurrency community. In 2021, a blockchain game called ""Axie Infinity"" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to earn stable income through the game. ""Axie Infinity"" is a pet breeding game based on blockchain technology, with multiple gameplay modes including NFTs. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, having surpassed $3 billion. According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds $8.2 million, approaching that of ""King of Glory"". On August 6th this year, Axie Infinity's official website claimed that its daily active users exceeded one million. The popularity of ""Axie Infinity"" has introduced a new ""play-to-earn"" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single-role participants. In addition to gaining enjoyment and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem. This subjectivity is not granted by the game developer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology. When I saw news about my friend's stock price, my biggest realization was that when choosing investment targets, companies should first choose industries with large growth potential, at least with market sizes above 1 trillion dollars. Secondly, they should choose industries with good future growth potential, considering industries that will reach their best growth phase in the next 3-5 years. Finally, they should choose industries with policy support. The width of the race track refers to the market size, the length of the race track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the race track is flat or rugged refers to the industry's competitive landscape. Let's cheer for the right race track!" In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022. Tactics are about ""doing the things right"", which means doing things correctly. Strategy, on the other hand, is about ""doing the right thing"", which means doing the right things. Strategy is about finding direction, while tactics are about implementation. Above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking. For example, when thinking about how to increase customers (tactical thinking), one can also consider whether to deepen the current field or expand horizontally (strategic thinking). When thinking about improving customer retention (tactical thinking), one can consider how to improve the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking). When thinking about improving activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider setting the correct activity KPIs, achieving the correct activity objectives, such as improving target customer participation, activating high-value inactive customers, and precise user acquisition. When thinking about increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable. In 2021, Bitcoin celebrated several milestones in its 12-year history. On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated Bitcoin as legal tender, making it the first country or region to do so. On October 12th, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ProShares' application to launch a Bitcoin ETF, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land on the U.S. capital market and expanding the exposure to cryptocurrency investments. From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist. On November 14th, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called ""Taproot"", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself."
