As NFTs quickly gain popularity, a new concept emerges in the crypto community. In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a significant impact in Southeast Asia, providing a stable income for some residents who lost job opportunities due to the pandemic. "Axie Infinity" is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, featuring various gameplay elements, including NFTs, and is currently the highest-grossing NFT project, with total transactions exceeding $3 billion. TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds $8.2 million, approaching the popular game "Honor of Kings." On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity's official account claimed that its daily active users had surpassed 1 million. The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has introduced a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer single-purpose characters, and in addition to enjoying the game and reaping economic benefits, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem. This subjectivity is not granted by the game developer but guaranteed by blockchain technology. Upon seeing a piece of news about a friend's stock price, my biggest takeaway is that a company's choice of track, or the choice of the industry it invests in, should first consider industries with significant growth potential, at least a market size of over $100 billion; second, choose industries with strong future growth prospects, considering industries that will reach their peak growth in the next 3-5 years; and finally, choose industries with government support. The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is smooth or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry. Let's cheer for the right track! In the new year, the first thing to do is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022. Tactics are about "doing things right," which means doing things correctly. Strategy, on the other hand, is about "doing the right thing," which means undertaking the correct actions. Strategy is about finding direction, while tactics focus on implementation. In most tactical considerations, there is room for strategic thinking. For example, when considering how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally into other areas (strategic thinking); when trying to improve customer retention rates (tactical thinking), one can consider how to enhance the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); when working on increasing event participation (tactical thinking), it's important to set the right event KPIs, achieve the right event goals, such as improving target customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; and when increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable. In its 12-year history, Bitcoin has experienced several milestone events in 2021. On September 7, the Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, marking the first time that Bitcoin has become legal currency in a country or region. On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved for the first time in eight years the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. capital market, further expanding the exposure to cryptocurrency investments. From a blockchain technology development perspective, Bitcoin is not the main protagonist. On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which improved the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.
