As NFT is flaming out of the ring, a new concept has emerged in the crypto community. 2021 saw a blockchain game called Axie Infinity make a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who had lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income in this game. Axie Infinity is a pet raising game with blockchain technology as the underlying layer, which collects a variety of gameplay methods including NFT and is currently the highest traded NFT project with over $3 billion as of now. On August 6 of this year, Axie Infinity officially said its daily users have exceeded 1 million. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single player, but can participate in the governance of the game ecosystem, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game. This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology. Seeing a news about the share price of friends, my biggest feeling is the choice of the enterprise in the track, which means the choice of the underlying industry of investment, firstly, to choose the industry with large growth space, at least 100 billion market size; secondly, to choose the industry with good future growth, consider the industry with the best state of industry growth after the next 3-5 years; finally, to choose the industry with policy support. How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry. Cheer for the right track! The first thing to do in the new year is to take stock of 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022. Tactics is to "do the things right", that is to do the things right. And strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, to do the right thing. Strategy is to find the direction, tactics is to implement, in most tactical thinking above, there is room for strategic thinking. For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend in the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right activity KPI to achieve On top of improving campaign engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right campaign KPIs to achieve the right campaign goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and pulling in new customers with precision; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable. Twelve years in the making, Bitcoin saw several milestones in 2021. on September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, the first time Bitcoin became legal tender in a country or region. on October 12, the SEC approved the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares for the first time in eight years and its listing on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital markets and another expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure. In terms of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main character. on November 14, 2021 Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.
