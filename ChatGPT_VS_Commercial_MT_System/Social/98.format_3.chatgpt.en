Have you encountered any problems with initial registration for first-level cost certification and continuing education learning hours? Registered personnel who miss the deadline and fail to provide proof of continuing education learning will need to provide proof of at least 30 learning hours within the past year. Those who need to re-register should provide proof of at least 120 learning hours within the past four years, and for each subsequent year, at least 30 learning hours should be provided. The cost standards for continuing education for cost engineers include payment of study fees to various management agencies when registering for online continuing education. The standard fees are generally 300 yuan per person per year for 30 hours of required courses (including unified continuing education textbooks) and 300 yuan per person per year for 30 hours of elective courses. The cost for both the 30 hours of required courses and the 30 hours of elective courses is 600 yuan per person per year (including unified continuing education textbooks). Participants in online continuing education for registered cost engineers organized by the China Institute of Value and other provincial and departmental management agencies should calculate learning hours based on the time recorded in the online courseware. Participants in centralized face-to-face training sessions and various types of training courses and seminars organized by the China Institute of Value and other provincial and departmental management agencies can obtain 4 learning hours per half-day. Participants in continuing education courses taught by the China Institute of Value, provincial and departmental cost engineers and cost accountants can obtain 10 learning hours per half-day. Participants in China Institute of Value and provincial-level research projects, industry standard formulation, and textbook writing can obtain 30 learning hours per year per project. "(6) Participating in the compilation of textbooks and the setting, review, and grading of questions for the national cost engineer professional qualification examination can earn 30 credit hours per year. (7) Publishing engineering cost-related professional papers or works under one's own name and publicly (based on the official publication number) can earn 12 credit hours per ten thousand words for published works. Publishing papers in national-level journals can earn 8 credit hours per thousand words, while publishing papers in provincial-level and city-level journals can earn 5 and 3 credit hours per thousand words, respectively. (9) Participating in publicly available training programs (excluding general management and skill training programs for companies) organized by engineering cost consulting enterprises approved or authorized by the China Association of Cost Engineers, provincial or departmental management agencies, or provincial-level cost associations can earn 4 credit hours per half day, with a maximum of 30 credit hours per year. The process of continuing education for cost engineers through online learning involves opening the student's account immediately upon receipt of the fee by the registration institution. Cost engineers can enter the online classroom to learn by using their username and password. Students can learn through methods such as watching courseware, asking questions, and online discussions. If a student forgets their password and cannot log in to study because the username and password are incorrect, they should contact their registration institution. The registration institution can assist in modifying the student's password (but not the username), and the student can then use their modified password to log in again.
