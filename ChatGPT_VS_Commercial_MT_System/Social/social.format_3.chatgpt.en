In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province from a real estate agent. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase with Lin, a family member of the property owner, and paid a deposit of RMB 200,000 through a bank transfer on the same day. Lin signed as the recipient of the deposit on the "Receipt for the Sale of Factory Deposit," which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will belong to the seller. If the seller is unwilling to sell the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice. The two parties agreed to sign the factory sale contract within one week." However, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on major contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and payment method, resulting in a delay in the signing of the property sale contract. A few days later, Lin returned the deposit to Mr. Lu, considering that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contract content. Mr. Lu, who had finally found a house, paid the deposit, and prepared the house payment, was left helpless and angry when the seller refused to sell the property just before the contract was signed. As a result, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao People's Court. The court held that the failure to sign a formal contract could not be solely attributed to the defendant and should be reasonably presumed as failed negotiations. Therefore, the penalty provisions for the deposit should not apply, and the defendant should not bear the breach of contract liability of returning double the deposit. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the second-instance court upheld the original judgment. [Lawyer Reminder] It is necessary to exercise due diligence during the transaction process. As a buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner and whether the property is occupied, when signing the contract. It is also important to specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between both parties during contract performance.
"You are Zheng Mian, and this is your second week living in Japan. You were walking on the street when suddenly you noticed someone was following you. Feeling afraid, you started walking faster and ended up running. The person behind you was chasing after you and calling out, ""Miss, please wait!"" (the conversation was all in Japanese). You stopped at the entrance of a convenience store, and the person who was chasing you said, ""Miss... I am a director. I think you're very beautiful. Would you be interested in participating in a reality show?"" You were skeptical and afraid that it might be a scam, but he gave you his business card, and you saw that he was indeed a director for a large entertainment company in Japan. He said, ""If you have time, we can go to the company and talk about it. You will definitely be paid for your role."" You were confused but thought that there was nothing to lose, and you could even make some money, so you ended up signing the contract. It turned out to be a large-scale reality dating show, divided into two parts." In the first part of the show, the celebrities and ordinary people will live together in real life to build up their understanding and cooperation. In the latter part, they will participate in a game together to pass various challenges. The official recording will start next week, but you have no idea who your partner will be and what interesting things will happen during the show.
First of all, let me state my conclusion: personally, I think "Four Seas" is a completely bad movie in every sense. However, if you ask whether this movie has any highlights, it's not completely true - at least the soundtrack is well chosen. There are many types of bad movies. One type is the kind that makes you fall asleep in the cinema, and another type is the kind that makes you indignant after watching it. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei to the audience - it can ignite your anger in countless ways. Han Han is really talented in insulting the audience. The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a sci-fi novel that is difficult to describe and full of loopholes, just like the windbreaker on Xiao Ma Ge's body. After watching it, you will even doubt whether there are hidden metaphors implied by the director, but after careful consideration, you will find that it is just a piece of shit. Let me briefly describe some of the plot points that I find hard to understand. The protagonist lives on a small island in the south with his grandmother, and her wish is to see snow. Then the plot arranges for an old man from the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see snow. An elderly person sitting in a bread van from the south to the northeast to see snow?? He and his father are still very confident about this. Then the old man had nothing more to say. How did the female protagonist's brother get a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship? How could the street racing gang easily close off a section of mountain road? Then a truck carrying steel bars stopped in the middle of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't be found around. The prop feeling is too obvious. Why would a small-time gang member with bad credit and suspected of illegal activities become an auxiliary police officer? Why didn't they report to the police about the high-interest loans, and the police in the movie even asked if they were in trouble? An adult who knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, and is forced to sleep outside the room because they can't find the hotel owner? These inexplicable plots are rampant throughout the film. Because the plots are too absurd, they even make me feel painful when I recall them. Apart from the plot, what's worse about the movie is its theme, or rather, the movie doesn't have a theme at all. It's an ugly patchwork of different elements. At the beginning of the movie, you might think it's a comedy, but after 20 minutes, you might guess it's an inspirational movie. Halfway through, you might think it's a drama about the struggles of small-town youth. But after you finish watching it, you have no idea what you just watched. This leads to deep self-doubt and makes you wonder why you spent your New Year's Day watching such a terrible movie. Most people are familiar with the formula for making various types of movies. If you want to make a movie about a motorcycle racer, for example, you need inspiration and comedy, and you need to show the audience how a talented rookie overcomes obstacles to succeed. If you want to make a romantic movie, you should honestly tell the story of the love and hatred between a motorcycle-riding small-town youth and a waitress. If you want to reflect reality, at least the plot cannot contradict the normal world. (For example, the character played by Yin Zheng just burned his new motorcycle, but can still sing.) You cannot create some mind-boggling nonsense. I don't know if the female lead's childish behavior is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements. Also, I'm confused as to why Han Han, as a racing driver, is so keen on adding car crashes to his own movies. Is this movie being released during the Spring Festival just to annoy the audience?
I accidentally came across the following article, which discusses from a business perspective and a preservation period perspective why this customer wants the logistics company inside the bonded zone to help with the canning, even though canning is considered deep processing and not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company. The following text may explain why the customer wants to do this. I have visited many milk powder manufacturers and have been in contact with many milk powder production lines. In fact, the raw materials for bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference. So you may ask: why does bagged milk powder have a shelf life of one year, while canned milk powder has a shelf life of two years or more? Or why is there such a big price difference between canned and bagged milk powder? In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or moms, think that the quality of canned milk powder is better because the raw materials are different. In fact, the raw materials are the same, but people think that the more expensive one is better. Some consumers even have a mindset that after eating canned milk powder, they claim that the taste is different! Now let me first explain why canned milk powder is more expensive, what makes it expensive? And why is there such a big price difference when the raw materials are the same? Most manufacturers consider that if the price of bagged milk powder is too high, it will be difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is low or even non-existent. Then, how can the manufacturer survive? Therefore, they have a significant increase in pricing for canned milk powder to ensure their profit margins. As a result, most manufacturers promote canned milk powder instead of bagged milk powder. Also, many manufacturers spend tens of millions or even billions of yuan on advertising every year. Where does this cost come from? You can imagine. With the development of society, the cost of marketing, such as promotion personnel in shopping malls, display costs, product gifts, advertising costs, etc., is increasing. Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, mainly canned milk powder, with prices continuously rising, which is actually a new product that emerges as market costs increase. The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, and the cost increase for raw materials is generally no more than 3 or 4 yuan. Additionally, some brands use any means to promote their products, even colluding with doctors in hospitals to assist in product promotion, and they can make a profit of 30 to 80 yuan per can. However, this kind of operation is absolutely not allowed under Chinese law, and it is actually harming consumers. It is recommended that people buy bagged milk powder and pour it into a can at home, which can save costs and increase the storage and sealing of the milk powder without any impact on children. Also, do not think that the shelf life of canned milk powder is shorter than that of the boxed one. After opening the package, the shelf life of boxed and canned milk powder is the same. The difference is that boxed milk powder is not easy to store and can easily become damp and deteriorate."
I just read an article about menstruation, but it was too long. Let me give a quick introduction to male readers who may not know about it. Most girls will experience their first period, or menstruation, at some point between the ages of 13-15, and will stop having periods around the age of 50. After the first period, assuming good health, menstruation will occur approximately once a month, but it's not regular enough to predict precisely, with a margin of error of about a week or so. Preparation is needed, and sometimes even with good luck, things can go wrong (e.g., starting several days earlier than expected). The duration, volume, and level of pain experienced during menstruation vary from person to person. Some people experience three days of menstruation, while others may have it for a week; some people have a light flow, while others experience heavy bleeding. Some people experience no discomfort, while others experience such severe pain that they need to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. The level of pain experienced can also change over time. Just because someone did not experience pain in the past doesn't mean they won't experience pain in the future. Menstruation cannot be controlled, and during the several days from the beginning to the end of the period, blood will flow for 24 hours a day. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to prevent blood from staining clothing or furniture. The main cause of menstrual pain is the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen as soon as possible when menstruation starts can effectively relieve pain for the current month, but it won't help much if taken after the pain has started. Before menstruation, due to increased blood flow to the uterus and excessive release of prostaglandins, some people may experience diarrhea. If diarrhea occurs at about the expected time in the menstrual cycle, it usually means that menstruation is coming within the next two days. Sanitary pads should be changed every two to three hours to prevent the growth of bacteria. Excluding sleeping hours, the worst-case scenario would be to change pads six times a day, for seven days a month, which equals 42 pads. If someone prepares ahead of time, they may need up to 50 pads, but it doesn't mean they will use one pad every month. (Note: tampons do not need to be changed as frequently, as they can be worn for about five to six hours, with a maximum of eight hours.) Hormones during menstruation can make someone irritable, and hormones during ovulation can cause emotional instability. It's just unlucky that the body can work against itself. However, official crime rate data shows that women are still capable of controlling their emotions, and they won't use emotional issues as an excuse. Menstruation is not just about bleeding; it also involves shedding the uterine lining. After menstruation ends, the uterine lining is at its thinnest and gradually thickens. It's like building a house every month to prepare for a guest who never arrives, and then tearing it down (menstruation) to build a new one the next month. Menstruation is very inconvenient, with 24-hour bleeding for several days every month for decades, along with abdominal and back pain. Who would willingly choose this? However, the fact that people can be born is due to their mothers' menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months when you come into this world. Everyone should be grateful for their mother's regular and healthy menstruation. In the past, many things related to women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into thinking that menstruation was dirty and shameful. People used to believe this, but times have changed. If someone finds menstruation disgusting or thinks that the female body's preparation for carrying life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it publicly. Girls, stand up for yourselves and don't let people think" Lastly, sisters, give menstrual cups a try, they are really useful.
Metaphysics refers to the use of rational reasoning and logic to study questions that cannot be directly answered through perception. Metaphysics is a fundamental principle of philosophy that aims to explain the basic properties of existence and the world. The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is taken from the sentence "The metaphysical is called the Way; the material is called the vessel" in the "Xici Zhuan" section of the Book of Changes, and was translated from the word "metaphysic" by the Japanese philosopher Tetsuro Watsuji in the Meiji era. Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and related issues. Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns represent only concepts. Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God and its theoretical basis assumes that all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution. Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that does not refer to God. Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body, especially the brain. Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between the mind and body. Epistemology is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge. Ethics is a discipline that systematically reflects on and studies human moral life, where morality is defined as a set of behavioral standards recognized by a group of people or a culture. It is mainly divided into metaethics (which abstractly studies ethical theories or critiques their essence), normative ethics (which evaluates different moral views and provides moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior, studying what kind of ethical standards people should follow), applied ethics (which applies ethical theories to practical life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (which collects information about how people live and summarizes from observed patterns. Its examination of ethics is not based on anticipated theory but investigates actual moral agents' real choices, all moral factors that contributed to their decisions, and it discusses the ethical views held by social groups). The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics, humanistic ethics represented by figures such as Valla and Montaigne in the first part, ethical ideas of the religious reform represented by Calvin in the second part, political ethics represented by figures such as Machiavelli in the third part, and modern ethics (17-18th century British empiricism ethics, represented by figures such as Hume; 17-18th century European rationalism ethics, represented by figures such as Spinoza; 18th century French Enlightenment ethics, represented by figures such as Voltaire; 18-19th century German academy ethics, represented by figures such as Kant and Hegel; 18-19th century British utilitarian ethics, represented by figures such as Bentham and Mill; 19th century evolutionary ethics, represented by figures such as Spencer and Huxley; late 19th century German Neo-Kantian ethics, represented by figures such as Lotze; late 19th century New Hegelian ethics, represented by figures such as Thomas Hill Green), transitional ethics (non-rationalist ethics, represented by figures such as Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche). Logic is a discipline that studies the principles and standards of "valid inference and proof." Logic typically includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, and can be divided into formal logic and informal logic. Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the nature and meaning of beauty.
Ding Zilin: To my friends. I sincerely thank all of my friends for the humanitarian assistance given to us during the more than 30 years since our loved ones passed away, especially since I made a personal appeal for humanitarian assistance to domestic and international friends in early 1994, and the assistance has continued uninterrupted until now. Nowadays, most of the parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and found employment. Your kindness helped us get through the most difficult times. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging worldwide, and most of the donors are already retired. Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop donating to us, the Tiananmen Mothers, for humanitarian assistance. This humanitarian assistance activity should have been concluded long ago. I will always remember your kindness and firmly believe that your good deeds will be remembered by history. Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, and I hope you can understand. Please accept my sincere wishes. Tao Ye'an: Please allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in humanitarian assistance. During their humanitarian assistance work, the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation (MCDF) were two parallel organizations, and the project implementers often crossed over. (Image from the Apple Daily: The Tiananmen Mothers' website is managed by Tao Ye). The humanitarian assistance funds often could not be delivered smoothly to the families of the June Fourth victims. In 1994, at the suggestion of Professor Ding, the "Tiananmen Mothers" established a special group to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian assistance funds. In 1998, the MCDF established the "June Fourth Orphan Education Fund," which was carried out for 11 years. After all the June Fourth orphans graduated from university in 2009, the MCDF then established the "June Fourth Poor Elderly Assistance Fund," which is still being carried out today. The funds for these projects mainly came from donations from campuses and society during the June Fourth incident, from individual generous donations, and received support from brother university democracy foundations. Since 2018, they have also received support from the Labor Education and Research Foundation. Last year, after 31 years, the families of the June Fourth victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June Fourth from Hong Kong. During this period, "Chinese Human Rights" also independently carried out their humanitarian assistance projects. We understand that Professor Ding's call to stop donating to the June Fourth victims is for the consideration of the donors, many of whom are retired and no longer have the same level of income as before retirement. Therefore, we would like to express our gratitude to Professor Ding for her "To My Friends" letter. We will respect the decision of the victims' families and terminate this project within two years, and immediately resume it if necessary. We express our gratitude and respect to those who have been generously donating and risking delivering humanitarian aid for many years.
I am a programming novice who wants to share my personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training. However, if you don't have such an idea, it is better to learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money and takes six months to complete. But if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed an excellent choice, especially for those who have weak self-discipline. Choosing a good training institution is very important. First, you need to look at the teaching staff. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, the training institution will not make sense. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong teaching staff. Secondly, before choosing, inquire about the training institution. It is best to inquire about the students who have studied in the institution, as only the students know whether the institution is good or not. Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't know your situation. Learning this thing is closely related to personal circumstances, such as major, age, language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of which are related to the industry you want to study or engage in. If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or have graduated from a computer major, I personally recommend self-study if you have sufficient time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. There are also many offline and online training institutions that are actually very good, but the cost is high, and you need to invest a lot of time, basically requiring 3-6 months of concentrated training. But if you fall into the situations I just described, self-learning is very convenient. Nowadays, there are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can go to Bilibili where there are many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be used in combination with videos for comprehensive learning. If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay some learning costs in terms of time and money, it is recommended to go to a training institution for learning. In this way, learning is not very difficult, the teacher's explanations are also very detailed, and there are people dedicated to answering questions. In addition, training institutions now often have employment agreements and internal referral quotas, and can recommend you to companies after your studies, which can save you a lot of trouble in the later job search and interview process. These are just my opinions, and because I don't know your situation, I can only provide a general introduction. If you have other questions or would like to consult, feel free to contact me for further communication.

Walk your own path in life. Good health and a good mood are two treasures in life, so live beautifully until old age!" At every stage of life, there will be different challenges. Often, what binds you is not your ability but the courage to face it positively. Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it calmly. The more afraid you are, the more likely you'll be overwhelmed by difficulties. If you face it head-on, the problem will eventually be resolved.
Although the rightists had their heyday in history, it was short-lived because they shine with just a little bit of sunshine and sweat with just a little bit of water. They are eager for more when they achieve something and attach themselves to whoever is in power when they face setbacks. However, to be fair, the rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress. The positive significance of the rightists should not be denied in terms of defining the standards of truth after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving science and technology, promoting institutionalization of the political system and safeguarding human rights, etc. As for myself, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's remarks, I care about what he says and respect him as a person because he is serious about China, its society, and its problems. However, I oppose his anti-Communist theory, as I believe that anti-revolution is necessary and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, and political groups that are mixed and disorderly, and that foreign countries will take advantage of this. To change or improve China, we need to have patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Those who try to take advantage of political opportunism are not rightists, they are bastards. Let's talk about the left. The left is actually a group of abandoned children of the times and politics. If the right has a positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of their opinions and analyze their ideas when needed, then the left has no such fortune because what they want is precisely what the Communist Party has thrown away! Recently, I have seen some friends arguing against anti-government people and refuting the leftists at the same time, and they seem quite upset. I think there is no need to do so. "Don't bother trying to reason with traitors or leftists. They're both stubborn and irrational. Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the anti-communists or leftists admit it. What's the point? Instead, I tell my friends: When anti-communists call you a ""50 cent party member,"" and when leftists call you a ""rightist dog,"" it just proves that our middle path is the right one! Many people have ideals when they are young, but they forget about them when they get older, or they become obsessed with them. They drift further away from their ideals, and sometimes even become the opposite of what they once were. Left and right, in my opinion, generally refer to restraint and freedom. Due to China's historical and cultural genes, China as a whole should be more left-leaning. The right-wing in China values freedom, efficiency, and development, while the left-wing emphasizes regulation, fairness, and security. At present, society as a whole hopes to focus more on fairness, and with the ongoing Sino-U.S. conflict, it's clear that China is leaning left, and this trend is likely to continue for many years. Although I don't understand it, I'll still give it a thumbs up and leave it at that. That's how generous I am."
In the past two years, the United States has imposed a blockade and containment on Huawei's chips, which has not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament but also caused huge losses to "American" companies. The US's suppression of China's chip industry requires its own companies and allied companies to simultaneously block our country's chip industry, directly resulting in the global chip supplier's orders and profits being affected, causing a decrease in research and development investment and production capacity of chip production companies, thus causing disruptions in the global chip supply chain. Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has spread to various industries around the world, such as car manufacturers shutting down production and mobile phone prices increasing. Almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected. In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips," more and more technology giants in various countries are beginning to move towards the "de-Americanization" path. In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control, and to restrain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit," inviting 64 country giants to establish a semiconductor alliance, and providing funding support to US domestic technology giants. For example, the old American technology giant Intel, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, invested 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened chip outsourcing business to the outside world. When most people thought that Intel's move would cause a certain impact on TSMC and was likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl," TSMC's founder, Zhang Zhongmou, was indifferent. At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou was astonishingly blunt about Intel's move to spend money building a wafer factory, saying that Intel's establishment of a chip outsourcing factory was quite ironic. The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite contemptuous of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that he still bears a grudge against a period of enmity between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago. In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the pride of American manufacturing, occupying a dominant position at the top of the global semiconductor industry and becoming a leader in the field. In the 1980s, only a few powerful players controlled the high-end semiconductor chip market. At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured, and tested by a single factory, with Intel being the representative of that era. However, this model made it difficult for small enterprises to cope, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs faced huge production line construction costs and could only shy away. Under the call of market demand, the chip industry began to see the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation in the 1980s. In 1984, when Zhang Zhongmou heard about a company that specialized in chip design, he believed that if there were companies specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established. Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and TSMC was born. TSMC focused its main business on "wafer processing", not design, only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing. At the time, the newly established TSMC was just a small player compared to the giant Intel. In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only manufactured the manufacturing process of the chip industry, they obviously had a high opinion of themselves and looked down on TSMC, decisively rejecting any investment in TSMC. Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel at the time looked down on wafer manufacturing services. It's ironic that the industry giant who once looked down on wafer manufacturing services now has to start doing wafer foundry. Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that Intel's entry into wafer foundry is very ironic. Nowadays, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel. Faced with TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally cannot rest on its laurels. Today, TSMC is already sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from 7 years ago. Catching up is not an easy task.
Today, let's take a look at some "strange hot searches". What is a normal public opinion? Randomly select three hot searches: "Dragon Raising its Head on the Second Day of the Second Lunar Month", "Haoliyou price increase", "Huo La La incident", the public opinion spreads and forms a peak, then the "index drops" (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small camel hump appearing again. They look no different from the "Internet public opinion evolution model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. What is abnormal public opinion? Randomly select six hot searches from the same event, presenting "isolated peaks", "sawtooth shapes", and "cliff shapes". "Isolated peaks" are artificially heated, quickly rushing to the top of the hot search list and attracting public attention; "sawtooth shapes" are periodically heated to ensure that the topic occupies the top of the hot search list; "cliff shapes" are collective evacuations, where the hot search has played its "role" and received new tasks, charging towards new battlefields. In Figure 9, the peak of an event's popularity is exactly the trough of another event, down to the second, which must be a unified batch of water army receiving tasks and starting a new round of attacks. The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, some attracting attention, some responsible for science popularization, some stirring up trouble, some diverting attention, some affecting cognition, some misleading judgment, and some inciting emotions. Black industry accounts operate in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all elements of public opinion dissemination and expansion. Communication is a science. Without subjective factors such as position and emotion, even from objective data, black PR will be exposed. Wherever we go, we leave a trace behind. Let's dig up these traces together.

What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs? In my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the questioner should be referring to LCD TVs. The main differences in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs are as follows: First, laser TVs focus more on the large screen market. Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TVs are products born for large screens. Currently, the mainstream size of LCD TVs is mostly between 55 and 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen color TVs. In recent years, the global shipment and sales ratio of laser TVs have been continuously increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above. According to Zhong Yikang's prediction, the sales growth of laser TVs in the market in 2020 will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain high-speed growth. The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection. Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly shoot into the eyes, which is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions compared to the backlight of LCD TVs, and produces less stimulation to the eyes. The Cybermart Laboratory of China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmic experts of Beijing Union Medical College Hospital conducted a rigorous comparative test of watching laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions, obtaining 144 sets of test data. The differences between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning? In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the poster should refer to LCD TV, and there are two main differences between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning: First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market. Compared with the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TVs are products born for large screens. Currently, the mainstream size of LCD TVs is mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest being over 100 inches, fully satisfying users' demand for large-screen color TVs. In recent years, the global shipment and sales ratio of laser TVs have been continuously increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales in the 80 inches and above category. According to Zhong Yikang's forecast, the sales growth of laser TVs in the market will exceed 140% in 2020, continuing to maintain a high growth rate. The reason for such good performance in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent eye protection performance of laser TVs. Based on the imaging principle of laser TV's diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eyeballs. Compared with the backlight of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is smaller. The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye protection characteristics, and even has certain improvement effects in specific aspects. In the current era when visual health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages but also opens up another breakthrough in the TV market. Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market. Unlike the continuous price reduction of LCD TVs, the prices of currently available laser TVs are mostly above 10,000 yuan, and prices gradually rise with the upgrade of size and light source. Why can laser TVs sell at such high prices? There must be a reason for it. With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve. With ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small and takes up little space. In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can achieve more than 2000 lumens. In addition, with lower heat generation, less equipment loss, and longer TV lifespan. In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies, such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, biomimetic screens, etc., which can bring users a more stunning audio-visual experience. It's not about fake demand, but rather a product of demand segmentation. In terms of image quality and return on investment, laser TVs may not be suitable for audio and video enthusiasts. If you want to balance a large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it out. Everything has advantages and disadvantages, and after weighing the pros and cons, you can make your own judgment. Just be careful not to believe everything you hear. In simple terms, the ultra-wide-angle short-throw projector -- laser TV, in order to be close to the screen, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflectors, which is not in line with the optimal optical design. In order to shield some ambient light, a microstructured Fresnel screen is used, which is expensive. The price of an 80-inch screen is basically equivalent to that of a 65-inch LCD. There is also one point that I particularly dislike about projector manufacturers using diffuse reflection as a selling point for being good for the eyes. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. Even if you diffuse the light onto the ceiling, the eyes still cannot see it. Isn't the same true for turning on a TV and lighting up the ceiling? Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflected, it cannot become an image. The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is precisely what is being ignored. A large amount of light is reflected into the eyes from a certain angle, and that is truly uncomfortable.
Is it reliable for Xiao Yusan to buy insurance? Xiao Yusan is an internet insurance broker platform. According to the ""Regulations on the Supervision and Administration of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Revised in 2015)"", in order to become an insurance brokerage company, three key criteria must be met: shareholders and initiators have no major violations in the past three years, the minimum capital requirement is RMB 50 million, and approval must be obtained from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC). These three criteria are actually very strict, and the summary is that strength is required, approval must be obtained from the national authoritative department of the CIRC that supervises insurance companies and banks, and shareholders must have good conduct. As an insurance brokerage company, Xiao Yusan Insurance does not need to be questioned about whether it is legitimate or not, because not all insurance companies can meet these three thresholds. In this respect, it is trustworthy. In terms of insurance products, Xiao Yusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies' star critical illness insurances are sold on this platform. For example, the newly launched HeTai Super Mario No.5 critical illness insurance is underwritten and claimed by HeTai Life Insurance, and Xiao Yusan Insurance is only a third-party intermediary. Therefore, its reliability is not in question. In terms of payment methods, internet platform products generally have a high price-performance ratio because they have lower operating costs and no salary costs for salespersons. Payment methods are flexible and support monthly payments, reducing the payment pressure on policyholders while maximizing the leverage of insurance. This aspect is still very good and worth considering. In terms of the professionalism of salespersons, this is particularly important because insurance is a highly specialized industry, and many internet products can be self-purchased by customers. This can lead to many misunderstandings, especially in terms of health and occupation information. Non-insurance professionals often add their own subjective opinions when purchasing insurance, believing that they are healthy or eligible, which can easily lead to many potential claim risks and the possibility of being denied. I myself used to work as a telephone salesperson for insurance at "Tencent Weibao" (like Xiaoyusan, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform). I want to responsibly tell everyone that internet insurance is genuine and reliable, but the issue lies with the people. Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are many instances of sales misguidance. For example, marketing strategies like 1 yuan for 6 million insurance coverage, buying insurance to get a free phone, and receiving 60,000 critical illness insurance coverage for free are not wrong, but they do not emphasize the details. They do not tell the policyholders that the first month is only 1 yuan, and the following months require normal fees ranging from tens to 200 yuan, so many customers who have been paying for one or two years do not know what they have bought. They think they can spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company will pay 6 million (a free lunch). The free phone is only given for special policy numbers like 6666 or 8888, and if the winning message is sent but not redeemed, there is no reminder for the policyholders. (This is another pitfall for the policyholders.) The free 60,000 critical illness insurance coverage is short-term and cannot solve the problem if only relied upon without other commercial insurances. If a real critical illness occurs, 60,000 yuan cannot solve the problem, and the policyholder's life will become exposed. Currently, the country is also cracking down on the deception in internet insurance sales. Therefore, overall, the platform and products are not problematic, but the issue lies with the professionalism and ethics of the salespeople. I suggest that the questioner carefully consider and weigh the options. In fact, many offline insurance brokers offer a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and options to choose from. The cost-effectiveness of some products is also better than that of internet products. I myself have helped 59 internet customers to underwrite offline products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan per year in insurance premiums. If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me. I am Mingya, an insurance broker with 3 years of enterprise management training experience, serving nearly a thousand corporate clients and cooperating with more than 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will tailor insurance products based on customer needs. During the purchasing process, I will compare different options to strive for the best underwriting result for customers. After purchasing, I will handle policy organization and management, so that customers can have peace of mind. I hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner. According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, internet insurance refers to insurance business that can be completed independently by the policyholder by clicking on the insurance application link. In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, and the insurance advisor does not need to sign either. All steps can be completed independently by the policyholder. Although the purchase of insurance through the internet may lack a certain ""ceremony,"" and may not even have a printed paper contract, the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract is not affected. This kind of mode is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of ""telephone sales,"" but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, that is - the follow-up service may not be able to keep up. Insurance is usually a long-term contract that may last for decades. When purchasing insurance, should we carefully consider whether the ""intermediary"" we choose can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services in many years to come?
From the past until now, I have always opposed any form of defamation and verbal abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate these kind of scoundrels. Regardless of political parties or factions, what we need to resist first is this uncivilized behavior. From the moment you sent me a friend request on Facebook and posted teasing posts, to when you tried to post my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have already chosen not to respond. Afterwards, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating comments about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my appearance, figure, fertility, and even comments about strawberry planting in bed and whether or not to insert it... I couldn't take it anymore. Later, I received messages from multiple friends about your Facebook account, which contained a photo of you and sexually harassing comments. I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent. After the news of my report to the police was published, you didn't back down, but became even more arrogant. I don't care about your political background or your status, in our society, respect between genders is necessary. Yes, you can continue to make teasing, obscure, humiliating, and abusive comments, you can continue to say that you only care about and pay attention to me, you can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that you made the picture or continue to make any kind of attacking comments. That's right, I can't and don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need your comments. I don't even think any girl would be willing to be humiliated like this in exchange for fame. Friends asked me if I'm okay, I said I am, but you wouldn't believe me. I don't think any girl who has been bullied like this can say that they are okay. Only those who lack basic moral principles in work, society, politics, or business would choose to use this method to harm any woman. I believe that justice is in people's hearts. I have captured some of the messages and hope everyone can judge for themselves. No one should be able to impersonate you in the posts you made. I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization, which makes me smile bitterly.
On January 17, 2022, the pro-Chinese media outlet, Duowei, reported the latest news on China-US relations. According to the report, the latest satellite images show that three American aircraft carriers are gathering around China's periphery. American media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal, made a rare visit to Guam, sending an important signal to both allies and opponents in the Indo-Pacific region. According to the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" think tank, on January 9th, a satellite discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabac Strait. The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific. The platform predicts that the USS Carl Vinson will be deployed to the South China Sea. This is the first time the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier has deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey transport planes. In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the US Navy currently has the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, which departed from the US on January 3rd, and is now cruising in the Pacific with its first F-35C fighter squadron. The squadron belongs to the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron. In addition to these two aircraft carriers, the USS Ronald Reagan is also deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, which is currently docked in Yokosuka, Japan. The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the USS Shiloh missile cruiser and the USS Stockdale missile destroyer. (Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) US Three aircraft carriers assemble around China's periphery, the most powerful weapon visits Guam rarely. On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US naval transport aircraft CMV-22B was disclosed. (Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to CNN's report on January 17, the US Navy's one of the most powerful weapons, the Ohio-class nuclear-powered submarine USS Nevada, which carries 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, visited the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15). Analysts said this move sent a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region. This is the first time a US ballistic missile submarine has visited Guam since 2016 and the second time it has publicly visited Guam since the 1980s. China has built a large number of military facilities on the South China Sea islands in recent years. The picture shows China's Yongshu Reef in the South China Sea. (South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy stated in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam has strengthened cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, demonstrated the US's ability, flexibility, and readiness, as well as its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Ballistic missile submarines are usually called "boomer submarines". The whereabouts of the 14 "boomer submarines" in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential. The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines has made them the "most important survival weapon" in the "nuclear triad" system, which also includes land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 capable of carrying nuclear warheads, located within the continental United States.
Talking with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock price, causing a $251 billion market cap loss. Zuckerberg responded that they are facing unprecedented competition. Why? Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with most of its revenue coming from advertising. As a company that makes money from advertising, Meta has its own traffic channels, including Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and more. Regardless of the specific features of these platforms, they all serve as Meta's traffic channels. Moreover, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps rely on Meta's advertising platform for monetization. However, times have changed. First, due to Apple's privacy policy changes, Meta is finding it difficult to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement. Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly and clearly prompts users whether to allow apps to access their information. Most people's normal reaction is not to allow it. If Google makes another move, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater. Second, the China factor that previously contributed to Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (although it's uncertain how much this factor weighed). As we all know, Meta does not have business operations in China, but this understanding is not entirely accurate. Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing overseas business. Meta has a few hundred employees in its Hong Kong office and several major agents in mainland China. For Chinese companies looking to expand into overseas markets, Meta is an indispensable advertising channel, and most of the money spent on advertising goes to Meta. Interestingly, ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years. All of ByteDance's agents in China were helping to place ads on Meta's platforms, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region was also good. I haven't looked into this recently, but it definitely won't be better than before. The stage of Chinese companies burning a lot of money overseas has passed. Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth. Facebook is getting older, and new platforms like TikTok are not in Meta's hands. The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth prospects. Capital markets not only value revenue but also place greater emphasis on future expectations. Obviously, Meta's expectations are insufficient. In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the ""metaverse."" The metaverse is indeed one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years. Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta. Although Facebook is now very popular and generates $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue annually, in fact, Facebook is very crisis-aware. Compared with other Internet and high-tech companies, it does not have good security moats. Although its several social software have high daily activities and are mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., Facebook also has no confidence in the face of TikTok's rapid development. The upheaval is just a matter of blinking. The concept of the metaverse is unattainable in the short term, and there is no hope of success. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg keeps changing the company's name and constantly seeking new tracks. However, I think his track choice is wrong, and it is a road of no return. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.

I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't stick with it, so I want to find a racket with a similar price to practice first. In fact, the price is often proportional to the friendliness level. If you can't tell the difference, the more expensive rackets are usually friendlier than the cheaper ones. These "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial junk. They have low strength and vibrate a lot when the ball hits the racket. Hard balls are difficult to handle, even for experts. Their logic and implication is that tennis is so difficult, they know you won't learn it, and they know you won't be willing to buy expensive ones. They sell you a cheap one to fool you. You'll play with it twice and won't play again. This way, the racket is cheap and you won't feel bad. When you can really tell the difference between good and bad rackets, it means you've made progress, and then you can come to me to buy an expensive one, and I'll make money twice. I suggest spending a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand, slightly better racket, such as Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not famous enough to sell expensive rackets, and new rackets priced at 500-600 are already good enough. Second-hand rackets cost around 200 yuan. Isn't it great to enjoy the experience of a thousand-yuan racket? It's friendly for beginners, but it becomes worthless once you pass the beginner stage. However, most people, especially girls, can't pass the beginner stage.

What was the hottest trend in 2021? Undoubtedly, it was the Tokyo Olympics. Did you think that only Olympic athletes can win awards? Recently, an article titled "Quick Look! Project Managers Can Compete for Olympic Gold Medals" went viral, which mentioned that project managers can take the lead in many projects and no one can match them: doing laborious work, going on business trips, and staying up late are all part of a project manager's daily routine, while putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are just the norm. Although this article seemed like a joking remark, it also revealed the daily hardships of project managers and represented their powerlessness in current project management work. Project managers have gradually chosen to take action to overcome their work difficulties. According to the "20 Years of Development of Chinese Project Management (1999-2019)" report, as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® examination applicants in China was nearly 600,000, the number of certified PMP® holders was approximately 420,000, and the number of valid certificate holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide. The number of PMP certified personnel has increased year by year in the past decade, which indicates that more and more project managers have realized that relying on simple application of past "old experience" to do things is no longer feasible. The constantly changing work environment has taught us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the path forward. However, does obtaining a PMP certification guarantee unobstructed project management work? "Many novice project managers have expressed that by studying related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically grasp the ten major areas and five process groups of project management and other related knowledge points, but when they actually engage in project management work, they still feel confused. Many project managers often give feedback on the following issues: inadequate understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theories but not knowing how to practice; lacking support from systematic project management processes and systems, unable to implement work, inaccurate project estimation, poor control sensitivity, and repeated delays in projects; unclear division of labor among team members, and ""old hands"" in the team do not know how to deal with it; cross-departmental communication is not smooth, making it difficult to advance the project... Therefore, with a focus on product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has won honors such as ""China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base"", has brought the ""R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp"" online course. The ""R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp"" is an online fragmented learning method that combines practical cases, tools, and methods of many R&D-oriented companies to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the path to advanced project management. It is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the cultivation of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operational results to the enterprise. Don't just take our word for it, you can first see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only explained in-depth by the Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly the Huawei R&D management team), combining international advanced project management methodology and numerous well-known corporate real business scenarios. It also provides scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates and forms to help students transform what they learn in the course into practical work."
Claimed to have the loudest exhaust sound in the New Shan area! This time our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men! It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4! Priced at nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, with an annual road tax of over ten thousand Malaysian Ringgit, four-wheel drive, and why is it called LP700? Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is? Well, I don't know, but the data says it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which is probably when my Myvi (a type of car) reaches 30km/h, they have already reached 100km/h, hmm. The low and sleek body, the bold scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine visible under the glass, perfectly exemplify the style of Lamborghini. There is no need to say too much about the car model, just Google it yourself, and I have compiled some explanations that Google may not provide! It's too much of a spectacle, everyone is watching wherever you go, it's uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of awesome) The fuel cost for 1 km is around RM1 (car owners don't care). You need to practice the posture for getting in and out of the car, otherwise it may be a bit awkward (because you might get stuck halfway while trying to climb out of the cabin). The engine sound is too loud, and you will suddenly become deaf after getting out of the car. (But it's still awesome) The body of the car is too big, and it will be very narrow to park in a regular parking space. I'm afraid that the car next door will hit it when opening their door! It's a bit lonely because there are no opponents on the road (the editor said this, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha). Please don't misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry! Friends who want to shoot videos for their own cars are welcome to contact us! For more car information that you don't know, visit The Car Guide/People's Car Journal. In a million-dollar car accident! Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both well-known among car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the million-dollar range! Recently, in just a few minutes, a million-dollar Porsche 911 and a ten-million-dollar Chiron were crashed in a foreign country! Looking at the results, it's reasonable that it's expensive!
"At the time when NFTs were quickly becoming popular, a new concept emerged in the cryptocurrency community. In 2021, a blockchain game called ""Axie Infinity"" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to earn stable income through the game. ""Axie Infinity"" is a pet breeding game based on blockchain technology, with multiple gameplay modes including NFTs. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, having surpassed $3 billion. According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds $8.2 million, approaching that of ""King of Glory"". On August 6th this year, Axie Infinity's official website claimed that its daily active users exceeded one million. The popularity of ""Axie Infinity"" has introduced a new ""play-to-earn"" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single-role participants. In addition to gaining enjoyment and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem. This subjectivity is not granted by the game developer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology. When I saw news about my friend's stock price, my biggest realization was that when choosing investment targets, companies should first choose industries with large growth potential, at least with market sizes above 1 trillion dollars. Secondly, they should choose industries with good future growth potential, considering industries that will reach their best growth phase in the next 3-5 years. Finally, they should choose industries with policy support. The width of the race track refers to the market size, the length of the race track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the race track is flat or rugged refers to the industry's competitive landscape. Let's cheer for the right race track!" In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022. Tactics are about ""doing the things right"", which means doing things correctly. Strategy, on the other hand, is about ""doing the right thing"", which means doing the right things. Strategy is about finding direction, while tactics are about implementation. Above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking. For example, when thinking about how to increase customers (tactical thinking), one can also consider whether to deepen the current field or expand horizontally (strategic thinking). When thinking about improving customer retention (tactical thinking), one can consider how to improve the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking). When thinking about improving activity participation (tactical thinking), one can consider setting the correct activity KPIs, achieving the correct activity objectives, such as improving target customer participation, activating high-value inactive customers, and precise user acquisition. When thinking about increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable. In 2021, Bitcoin celebrated several milestones in its 12-year history. On September 7th, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated Bitcoin as legal tender, making it the first country or region to do so. On October 12th, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ProShares' application to launch a Bitcoin ETF, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land on the U.S. capital market and expanding the exposure to cryptocurrency investments. From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist. On November 14th, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called ""Taproot"", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself."
