In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Zhating Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a housing agency. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase with the family member of the property owner, Mr. Lin, and transferred a deposit of 200,000 RMB via bank transfer on the same day. Mr. Lin signed the "Factory Purchase Deposit Receipt" as the payee, which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase contract within a week." However, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the major contract terms, such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, resulting in the housing sale contract not being signed. Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the 200,000 RMB deposit to Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu, who had finally found a property he liked, paid the deposit and prepared the payment, was left both frustrated and angry when the seller refused to sell at the last moment. As a result, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin in the Yuyao People's Court. The court found that both parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and the responsibility could not be solely attributed to the defendant. It was reasonably inferred that the negotiations were unsuccessful, so the deposit penalty rule should not apply in this case, and the defendant was not required to bear the breach of contract responsibility of returning double the deposit. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment. [Lawyer's Reminder] In the transaction process, it is essential to exercise necessary due diligence. When signing a contract, the buyer should fulfill their necessary duty of care, such as verifying the property owner's information, whether the property is occupied by others, and other relevant information. Additionally, it is important to specify the exact time and location of the property handover in the contract to prevent disputes between both parties during the contract execution.
Your name is Zheng Mian, and this is your second week after moving to Japan. As you walk down the street, you suddenly realize that someone is following you. Frightened, you walk faster and eventually start running. The person chases after you, shouting, "Miss! Please wait!" (The conversation is in Japanese throughout) You stop at the entrance of a convenience store. "Miss... I am a director. I think you are very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?" You are suspicious and afraid that it might be a scam. He hands you a business card, and you discover that he really is a director at a major Japanese entertainment company. "Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company and talk. You will be well compensated." You follow him to the company in a daze, and he says that he noticed you on the street and really hopes that you will participate. Thinking there is nothing to lose and you can make money, you sign the contract. This is a large-scale dating reality show, divided into two parts. In the first stage, celebrities and ordinary people will interact in real life to develop rapport. In the later stage, they will enter a game together to overcome challenges. The official recording will start next week, and you don't know who your partner will be or what interesting things will happen.
To state the conclusion first, I personally think that "Four Seas" is a terrible film in every sense of the word. However, if you were to say that this movie has absolutely no highlights, that would not be true either, as at least the soundtrack is quite good. There are many types of bad movies: ones that can put you to sleep in the theater, and ones that leave you filled with righteous indignation after watching them. For the audience, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei that can ignite your anger in countless ways. When it comes to insulting the audience, Han Han is truly gifted. The most painful aspect of this film is that it seems like a creation from a horrible novel, indescribable and full of holes, just like the trench coat on Little Marco. After watching it, you may even wonder if there are hidden metaphors implied by the director, but upon careful reflection, you'll find it's actually just a pile of crap. Let's start with a simple... He and his father were very confident about it. Then the story of the old man just ended there. How did the female lead's brother obtain a business license to open a hotel on an abandoned ship? How could the motorcycle gang on the island easily block off a mountain road? And then there's a truck delivering steel bars parked on the side of the road, with no driver to be found anywhere. The prop placement is just too obvious. Why would a person with bad credit and suspected illegal activities in a motorcycle gang become an auxiliary police officer? Why not call the police when facing loan sharks, especially when the police in the movie specifically asked if there were any difficulties? An adult who knows how to use a smartphone doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to not find the hotel owner, sleeping outside the room for the night? These inexplicable plots are scattered throughout the film, and recalling them is painful due to their absurdity. Besides the plot, what's even worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, the lack of one. It's just a hideous patchwork monster. At the beginning of the film, you might think it's a comedy; 20 minutes later, you might guess it's an inspirational film; halfway through, you may think it's a drama depicting the struggles of small-town youths. After watching it, you have no idea what you've just seen, which is followed by deep self-doubt, questioning why you went to the cinema to watch crap during the holidays. Most people are actually very familiar with various movie formulas. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle racer, you can combine inspiration and comedy and show the audience how a talented rookie gradually achieves success. If you want to make a romance film, just honestly tell the story of the love and grudges between a motorcycle-loving small-town youth and a waitress. If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot shouldn't contain elements contrary to the normal world (such as the character played by Yin Zheng, whose new motorcycle was just burned but could still sing). You shouldn't create plot holes that even Kennedy can't stand. As for the female lead, who is clearly not intellectually disabled but acts like a 5-year-old in some aspects, I don't know if it's due to her acting or the director's request. Another point I don't understand is why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies. Is the arrangement of such a movie during the Spring Festival to annoy the audience?
I accidentally came across the following article, which discusses from a business perspective and a preservation period perspective why this client wants a logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning, even though canning is considered deep processing and does not belong to the scope of business of bonded logistics companies. This article may be able to explain why the client wants to do this. I have visited many milk powder factories and have been exposed to many milk powder production lines. In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference at all. People would definitely ask: Why does bagged milk powder have a shelf life of one year, while canned milk powder has a shelf life of two years or longer? Or they might ask: Why is there such a big price difference between canned and bagged milk powder? Many consumers, or mothers, actually think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality is much better. In reality, the raw materials are the same, but people just believe that more expensive means better. Some consumers even have this mentality and say that the taste or flavor of canned milk powder is different after trying it! Now, let me first tell you the reason why canned milk powder is more expensive, where the cost comes from, and why there is such a big price difference with the same raw materials. When manufacturers set prices, most of them take into consideration that if the price of bagged milk powder is set too high, consumers will have difficulty accepting it. This means that the manufacturers' profits will be very low or even non-existent. So, how can they survive? As a result, they have a significant increase in the pricing of canned milk powder to ensure their profit margin. Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote canned milk powder rather than bagged milk powder. Moreover, you may consider the advertising expenses of so many manufacturers, which amount to tens of millions or even billions every year. Where does this money come from? It's easy to imagine. As society develops, market promotion costs, such as those for salespeople in shopping malls, display expenses, product giveaways, and advertising fees, are constantly increasing. So, manufacturers are constantly introducing new products, particularly canned milk powder, and their prices are also continuously rising. In fact, these new products are introduced as market costs increase. The main goal is to achieve higher profits, while the actual increase in raw material costs will not exceed 3 to 4 yuan at most. Furthermore, some brands resort to unscrupulous means to promote their products, such as collaborating with doctors in hospitals to help promote their products and making profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per can. Chinese laws strictly forbid such practices, and in fact, these methods are harming consumers. I suggest that if you have cans at home, you can buy bagged milk powder and transfer it into the cans. This way, you can save costs while increasing the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without causing any impact on the children. Also, don't assume that the shelf life of canned milk powder is longer than that of bagged milk powder. After opening, the shelf life of both canned and bagged milk powder is the same. It's just that bagged milk powder is not as easy to store after opening and is more susceptible to moisture and spoilage.
I just saw a lengthy article about menstruation, which I'll briefly explain for men who may not be familiar with the topic. Most girls will experience their first menstruation suddenly between the ages of 13 and 15, and it usually stops around the age of 50. Under the premise of good health, menstruation will generally occur once a month. However, it's not regular enough to predict precisely, with a margin of error of about a week, so preparations need to be made in advance. Sometimes, if luck is not on your side, it may start several days earlier than expected. The duration, blood flow, and pain levels during menstruation vary from person to person. Some people may have a period lasting three days, while others may have it for a week. Some individuals may have lighter flows, while others may experience heavy bleeding. Some people may not feel any discomfort, while others may suffer severe pain that requires medical attention. Painful periods can change over time, so not experiencing pain in the past does not guarantee a pain-free experience for life. Menstrual bleeding is uncontrollable and lasts 24 hours a day for several days from start to finish. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from staining clothes and chairs. Menstrual pain is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen as soon as the period starts and before the pain sets in can effectively alleviate the pain for that month. Taking pain relief medication after the pain has already started is less effective. Before menstruation, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is common to experience diarrhea. If you suddenly experience diarrhea around the expected time of your period, it is likely that menstruation will arrive within the next two days. Sanitary pads should be changed every two to three hours to prevent the growth of bacteria. Excluding sleep time, the worst-case scenario is changing pads six times a day for seven days a month, which amounts to 42 pads. If you include pads prepared in advance, the total may reach around 50 pads, not just one per month. (I should clarify here that tampons do not need to be changed as frequently, approximately every five to six hours, and no longer than eight hours.) During menstruation, hormonal fluctuations may cause irritability, and emotional instability may also occur during ovulation due to changes in internal hormones. It's rather unfortunate, as if the body is tripping itself up. However, official crime rate data shows that women have a high ability to control their emotions and do not use emotional issues as an excuse. Menstrual discharge consists not only of blood but also of the shed uterine lining. After menstruation, the uterine lining is at its thinnest and gradually thickens. You can think of the uterus as a house: every month, the house (the lining) is built in preparation for a guest who may not arrive, so it is dismantled (shed during menstruation) and rebuilt the following month. This cycle repeats. Menstruation is inconvenient, with continuous bleeding for several days every month for decades, accompanied by abdominal and back pain. Who would want that? However, people are born because their mothers experienced menstruation. Menstruation prepares the "house" where you will reside for ten months before your arrival in this world. We should all be grateful to our mothers for their regular and healthy menstruation. In the past, many aspects of women's lives were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into believing that menstruation was dirty and shameful. But times have changed. If someone finds menstruation disgusting or considers the body's preparation for nurturing life to be repulsive, they should not express such opinions in public. Girls should stand up for themselves and not think this way. Men who have never experienced and will never experience menstruation and who do not understand it should not be ungrateful or disrespectful. How can they face their mothers with such an attitude, or even think about having their own children? Lastly, ladies, give tampons a try; they are genuinely useful.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be directly answered through perception, using rational reasoning and logic. Metaphysics is a fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world. The Chinese translation "形而上学" is derived from the phrase "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" in "Yijing - Xici Shangchuan," translated from "metaphysic" by Japanese philosopher Inoue Tetsujiro during the Meiji era. Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and their related issues. Ontology is the study of "which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns only represent a concept." Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God. Its theoretical foundation holds that all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, proposed by philosophers supporting science and evolution. Methodological naturalism refers to a research method that makes no mention of God. Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body, especially the brain. Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and the body. Epistemology is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge. Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks about and studies human moral life; here, morality is defined as all behavioral norms recognized by a group of people or a culture. Ethics can be divided into meta-ethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or critiques), normative ethics (evaluating different moral views and providing moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior, studying the moral norms people should follow), applied ethics (applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information on how people live, summarizing patterns from observations, examining ethics based on actual moral agents' decisions, and discussing the ethical views held by social groups). The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics, and is divided into several parts: 1) Humanistic ethical thought, represented by figures like Valla and Montaigne; 2) Ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin; 3) Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others; 4) Modern ethics, including 17-18th century British empiricist ethics (represented by Hume and others), 17-18th century continental rationalist ethics (represented by Spinoza and others), 18th-century French Enlightenment ethics (represented by Voltaire and others), 18-19th century German academic ethics (represented by Kant and Hegel), 18-19th century British utilitarian ethics (represented by Bentham and Mill), 19th century British evolutionary ethics (represented by Spencer and Huxley), late 19th-century German neo-Kantian ethics (represented by Rickert), and late 19th-century neo-Hegelian ethics (represented by Thomas Hill Green); 5) Transitional period ethics, including irrationalist ethics (represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche). Logic is a discipline that studies the "principles and standards of valid inference and proof." Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning. It can be divided into formal logic and informal logic. Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the nature and significance of beauty.
Ding Zilin: To my friends. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all friends for the humanitarian assistance given to us during the more than 30 years after the tragedy of our loved ones. Especially since my personal appeal for humanitarian aid to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, the assistance has not been interrupted so far. By now, the vast majority of the elderly parents of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, married, and found jobs. It is your righteous deeds that have helped our families in distress through the most difficult moments. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc around the world, and most of the donors have reached retirement age. Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop providing humanitarian donations to us, the family members of the victims - the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian assistance activity should have been brought to a perfect end long ago. I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be recorded in history. Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way. Please understand, my friends! Please accept my sincere blessings. Tao Ye'an: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian aid by the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF). During the process of humanitarian assistance, the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) are two parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap. (Apple Daily image: The Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by Tao Ye'an.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm Relief funds often could not be smoothly delivered to the hands of the June 4th victims' families. In 1994, at the suggestion of Professor Ding, a special group was formed by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the reception and distribution of humanitarian relief funds. In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund." After 11 years of operation, in 2009, when all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF then set up the "June 4th Destitute Elderly Special Assistance Fund," which has been in operation ever since. The funding for these projects mainly comes from campus and social donations during June 4th, generous personal donations, and the support of sibling university democracy foundations. Since 2018, they have also received support from the Laogai Research Foundation. Last year, 31 years later, the families of the June 4th victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June 4th from Hong Kong. During this period, "China Human Rights" also independently carried out their humanitarian aid projects. We understand that Professor Ding's call to stop the June 4th donations is considering the donors, as we are indeed all retired elderly people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude for Professor Ding's letter "To My Friends." We will respect the decision of the families and terminate this project within two years. If necessary, we will immediately resume it. We would like to express our gratitude and respect to those chivalrous and righteous individuals who have persisted in generously donating and risking delivering humanitarian aid funds for many years.
A programming newbie wants to share their personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have such an idea, it's better to learn by yourself, after all, the cost of training is quite high, and it takes 6 months to learn. However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline. Training is an excellent choice. If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it may be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First, you need to look at the strength of the faculty. If the faculty is not strong enough, the training institution is not very meaningful. Of course, some newly opened training institutions do not have particularly strong faculty. Secondly, before choosing, inquire about the training institution, and it's best to investigate the students from the institution, after all, only the students know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or not. Hello, I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't provided enough information about your personal situation, and learning has a lot to do with one's personal circumstances. For example, your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you live in are all related to the industry you want to learn or engage in. If you are a student who hasn't graduated yet or has graduated with a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study, as it is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Many offline and online training institutions are actually quite good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is relatively large, basically requiring 3-6 months of concentrated training. However, if you are in the situations I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Many learning resources on the internet are free, or you can find many training resources on Bilibili. If you can't find resources, you can contact me through my bio to get free resources or detailed consultation. Additionally, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning. If you are not a computer major but can afford the cost of learning in terms of money and time, I suggest going to a training institution for learning. This way, the learning process is less strenuous, the teachers explain in detail, and there are dedicated people to answer questions. Moreover, it helps with learning planning and supervision. Many training institutions now sign employment agreements, offer internal referrals, and recommend students to companies after learning, making the interview process easier when looking for a job. The above are some of my opinions. Since I don't know your situation, my introduction is only approximate and not detailed. If you have other questions, feel free to contact me for communication and discussion.

Thank you to those who silently support me. We strive for a better life even though life is tiring, but we must continue. Life will not let down every hardworking person. If you like, please follow me. Thank you to those who silently support me. Life is like this; others only see the results, while we alone endure the process. In the face of life, we have no choice but to be strong and to continue. We can look back on the road, but we cannot go back. Cleaning is not only a job but also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of the service, and the service is brilliant because of the dedication. Although we cleaners do the dirtiest work, we will clean every corner of the client's home with the most serious attitude. When we see the satisfied smiles and thumbs-up of our clients, all the fatigue is worth it. Efforts will be rewarded! My daily work—your requirements, my service. Wholehearted service, wholehearted cleaning, retaining beauty. The details you care about, Fenggui housekeeping will help you achieve the best possible cleanliness. "Clean" to the best of my ability, serving your loving home. Maintaining cleanliness for thousands of homes, establishing a reputation in housekeeping, delivering services on point, and bringing cleanliness to every household. Indoor and outdoor cleaning is my daily work. Crystal chandeliers may be gorgeous, but without regular cleaning, they will become dull and lose their luster. Only after cleaning can they shine brilliantly again. Life is the same; only through dedication can we succeed, and only by being meticulous can we create refinement. We take caulking seriously. Give me a chance, and I will definitely satisfy you. Quality speaks for itself, and professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement! Every industry is tough nowadays, but I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, persistence, and effort, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining! A day's work starts in the morning, and all the beauty begins at dawn. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and satisfaction, and maintain a good mood throughout the day. Good morning! When we were young, happiness was a thing; if we had it, we were happy. As we grew up, happiness became a goal; if we achieved it, we were happy. After maturing, we realized that happiness is a state of mind; understanding it brings happiness. Be the most genuine and kind version of yourself, follow your heart, and live life without regrets. Life is a journey; walk your own path. There are two treasures in life: good health and a good mood. Stay beautiful and live happily ever after! In every stage of life, we encounter different challenges. Many times, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face them positively. Since you cannot avoid them, you might as well face them calmly. The more fearful you are, the more likely you are to be defeated by difficulties; if you face them head-on, problems will eventually be resolved.
Although the right-wing has had its moments of triumph in history, they were not long-lasting. The reason for their short-lived success is that they tend to become overly exuberant with a little sunshine and break a sweat with just a sip of water; they overreach when they gain a little power and become disoriented when faced with setbacks. However, to be fair, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress. From ending the Cultural Revolution and defining the standard of truth, to promoting economic development, improving science and technology, as well as promoting the institutionalization of the political system and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied. As for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I do care about and respect what he says and the person he is. This is because he is serious – serious about China and serious about addressing the social issues in China. However, I oppose his anti-communist theories. I believe that a necessary revolution would inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, political chaos, and foreign forces taking advantage of the situation. Changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude for the country and its people. Political opportunists who attempt to exploit the situation are not right-wing, they are scoundrels. Now, let's talk about the left. The left is actually a group of abandoned children of the times and politics. If the right has a positive significance for society and the Communist Party listens to some right-wing opinions and analyzes their thoughts when needed, then the left is not so fortunate, because what the left wants is precisely the dross that the Communist Party has discarded! Recently, I have seen some friends passionately criticizing both dissidents and the left-wing fanatics, and I think there's no need for that. Don't try to reason with traitors or left-wing fanatics, as they are both stubborn and unreasonable. Also, don't try to prove that we are right, and even more so, don't try to make dissidents and left-wing fanatics admit it. What's the point? I tell my friends this: when dissidents call you a "wumao" (50-cent party member) and left-wing fanatics call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct! Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they grow old, they either forget their ideals or pursue them to the point of becoming paranoid. They become more and more distant from their ideals, and even a young dragon slayer may ultimately turn into an evil dragon. In my opinion, the terms "left" and "right" generally refer to constraints and freedom. The innate cultural and historical genes of China lead it to lean towards the left. The domestic right-wing values freedom, efficiency, and development, while the left-wing emphasizes stronger regulation, focusing on fairness and security. Nowadays, society as a whole hopes for more fairness, and with the ongoing competition between China and the United States, leaning to the left is inevitable and likely to continue for many years. Although I may not understand everything, I'll just like it and say nothing more. That's just how supportive I am.
In the past two years, the US blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips have not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament but also caused huge losses for "American" companies. The US suppression of China's chip industry, demanding that its own enterprises and allied countries simultaneously block China's chip industry, has directly led to the impact on orders and profits of global chip suppliers, causing a reduction in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturing enterprises, and thus resulting in a global shortage and disorder of the chip supply chain. Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected major industries worldwide, such as car manufacturers halting production and mobile phone prices increasing, with almost all industries that use chips being adversely affected. In order to gain control of "chips," more and more tech giants from various countries are moving towards a path of "de-Americanization." In order to firmly control the global semiconductor market and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the US has recently been very active, hosting "chip summits," inviting 64 countries to form a semiconductor alliance, and supporting domestic tech giants with financial assistance. For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, the US tech giant Intel invested $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona and opened up chip foundry services to others. Most people thought that Intel's move would impact TSMC to some extent and possibly take away TSMC's "rice bowl." The reason for such certainty is that, as an old US tech giant, Intel has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, boasting a large talent pool and technical reserves, and is bound to rise rapidly in the short term, defeating TSMC. However, TSMC founder Morris Chang seems unimpressed by Intel's decision. At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April, Morris Chang made a surprising statement, saying without hesitation regarding Intel's investment in building wafer fabs: "Intel building a chip foundry is quite ironic." The reason why Morris Chang is disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is that he still bears a grudge against the old feud between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago. In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the crown jewel of American manufacturing, occupying a peak position globally and dominating the world's semiconductor field. By the 1980s, high-end semiconductor chips were controlled by a few powerful players. At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM (Integrated Device Manufacturer) model, where a single factory handled chip design, manufacturing, and packaging. Intel was the representative of that era. However, this model was too burdensome for some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only back off when faced with huge production line construction costs. Driven by market demand, the chip industry began to experience division of labor and collaboration in the 1980s. In 1984, Morris Chang heard about companies that specialized in chip design and thought that if there were companies dedicated to design, then a factory could be established specifically for wafer manufacturing. Not long after, Chang's idea became a reality, and TSMC was born. TSMC focused its main business on the single link of "wafer processing," not engaging in design but only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing. At that time, newly-founded TSMC was just a small player in front of the giant Intel. In order to obtain capital support, Morris Chang once sought investment from Intel. However, when Intel heard that TSMC only handled the manufacturing aspect of the chip industry, they clearly held themselves in high regard and looked down on TSMC, decisively refusing to invest in the company. Morris Chang also believed that Intel at that time did not value wafer manufacturing services. Unexpectedly, the giant that once looked down on wafer manufacturing services now also wants to start doing wafer foundry work. Therefore, Morris Chang thinks it is quite ironic for Intel to enter the wafer foundry business. Today, TSMC's market value has surpassed that of Intel. Faced with TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally cannot afford to be complacent. At present, TSMC is already sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm from seven years ago. Catching up is not an easy task.
Today, let's take a look at some "strange trending topics." What is normal public opinion? Let's randomly pick three hot searches: February 2nd, the Dragon Raising its Head, the price increase of Orion Confectionery, and the Huo Lala incident. Public opinion spreads and peaks, then the "index declines" (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, a small peak may reappear. They seem no different from the "online public opinion evolution model" once displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. What is abnormal public opinion? Let's randomly pick six hot searches from the same event, showing a "solitary peak," "serrated," and "cliff-like" pattern. A "solitary peak" is when people artificially heat up a topic, quickly making it a hot search and drawing public attention; a "serrated" pattern means periodically heating up the topic to ensure it remains on the hot search list; and a "cliff-like" pattern means a collective withdrawal after the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and received new tasks, moving on to new battlefields. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's popularity coincides precisely with the trough of another event, with no time difference. It must be the same batch of paid trolls receiving tasks and launching a new round of attacks. The professionalism of the black PR (public relations) industry is evident: dozens of hot searches are simultaneously on the list, some attracting attention, some providing information, some inciting conflict and creating momentum, some diverting attention, some influencing perceptions, some misleading judgments, some inciting emotions, and some affecting decision-making. Black market accounts operate in batches and at specific points, considering almost all elements of public opinion dissemination. Communication is a science.

What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs? To my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to LCD TVs. The main differences in market positioning between laser TVs and LCD TVs are as follows: First, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market. Compared to the comprehensive market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are more focused on the large-screen market, or it can be said that laser TVs are products born specifically for large screens. At present, the mainstream size of LCD TVs is between 55 and 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs. In recent years, the shipment and sales share of laser TVs in the global market has been continuously increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total sales of TVs with a size of 80 inches and above. According to the forecast by China Yi Kang, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140% in 2020, maintaining rapid growth. The reason for such good performance in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TVs in terms of eye protection. Based on the diffuse reflection imaging principle of laser TVs, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly enter the eye. Compared to the backlight source of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the natural imaging process of objects, causing less irritation to the eyes. The China Electronics Standardization Institute's SAI XI Laboratory and eye specialists from Beijing Union Hospital conducted a strict comparison test between watching laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions, obtaining 144 sets of test data. The data confirms that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection features and even have certain improvement effects in specific aspects. As the importance of visual health is increasingly emphasized, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye protection advantages but also open up another breakthrough in the color TV market. Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market. In contrast to the continuously decreasing prices of LCD TVs, the prices of most laser TVs on the market are currently above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrading of size and light sources, the prices gradually increase. Why are laser TVs so expensive? There must be a reason. With the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve. With ultra-short-throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter compared to traditional projection equipment. They can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience within a short distance, requiring little space, and the main unit is compact, occupying a small area. In terms of brightness, big-brand laser TVs can achieve over 2,000 lumens. In addition, they have lower heat generation, less wear and tear on the equipment, and a longer service life for the TV. In addition to this, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, and biomimetic screens, bringing users a more stunning audio-visual experience. It's not about false demand but rather a product of demand segmentation. In terms of image quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs may not be the choice for audio-visual enthusiasts. If you want to enjoy a large screen and have insufficient viewing environments, you can give it a try. Everything has its pros and cons, so weigh the options and make your judgment. Just be careful not to listen to one-sided opinions. In simple terms, ultra-wide-angle short-throw projectors—laser TVs—have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflective mirrors to get closer to the screen, which does not conform to the optimal optical design. To block part of the ambient light, they use microstructured Fresnel screens at a high cost. The price of an 80-inch screen could basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD. Another point I particularly dislike is when projector manufacturers use the advantage of diffuse reflection being good for the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse the light onto the ceiling, the eyes won't see it. If you want to be more specific, LCD TVs are also diffusely "direct" – doesn't the ceiling also get illuminated when you turn on the TV? Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffusely reflective, it wouldn't form an image. The hot spot (light spot) effect of high-gain screens, where a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, has been overlooked, and that is truly uncomfortable.
Is buying insurance through Xiaoyusan reliable? Xiaoyusan is an online insurance brokerage platform. Based on the conditions set: According to the "Insurance Brokerage Supervision Regulations (revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three key requirements must be met: shareholders and initiators must not have any significant violations within the past three years, a minimum capital of 50 million RMB is required to establish the company, and approval from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission is necessary. These three conditions are quite strict, which means that the company must be strong, approved by the national authority that supervises insurance companies and banks (CBIRC), and have shareholders with a good reputation. As an insurance brokerage company, policyholders don't need to worry too much about whether Xiaoyusan is legitimate, as not every insurance company can meet these three conditions. In this regard, it is quite good and trustworthy. In terms of insurance products: Xiaoyusan is like an insurance supermarket, with many companies selling their star critical illness insurance products on the platform, such as the recently launched Hetai Super Mario No. 5 critical illness insurance. Both the claims and underwriting sides are handled by Hetai Life Insurance, and Xiaoyusan is only a third-party intermediary, so its reliability should not be questioned. From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because they have lower operating costs for outlets and employee salaries, generally have a higher cost-performance ratio. They also offer flexible payment methods, supporting monthly payments to ease the pressure on policyholders while maximizing the leverage of insurance. This aspect is quite good and worth considering. Regarding the professional level of salespeople: This is particularly important because insurance is a highly specialized industry. Many internet product customers can purchase insurance themselves, which may lead to misunderstandings, especially in health disclosure and occupation. Non-insurance professionals often add their subjective judgment when purchasing insurance, thinking they are healthy or eligible, which can lead to potential claim risks and possible rejection of claims. I have personally worked as a telephone insurance salesperson on "Tencent Weibao" (similar to Xiaoyusan, also an online insurance brokerage platform) and can responsibly tell everyone that online insurance is indeed real and reliable. However, the unreliable factor is people, as there are many cases of sales misinformation in the online channels due to the lack of professional practitioners. For example: 1 RMB insurance covering 6 million RMB, buying insurance with a free mobile phone, and receiving a free 60,000 RMB critical illness coverage. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they tend to downplay important details. They won't tell the policyholder that after the first month of paying 1 RMB, they need to pay the normal rate which can vary from tens to 200 RMB. Many customers are unclear about the actual insurance they have purchased after being charged for a year or two. They might think that they can spend 1 RMB and the insurance company will pay 6 million RMB (as if a pie is falling from the sky). The free mobile phone offer applies to special policy numbers, like those ending with 6666 or 8888. If you receive a winning text message but don't claim the prize, nobody will remind you (which is a pitfall for policyholders). The free 60,000 RMB critical illness coverage is short-term, and if you rely solely on this without any other commercial insurance, it won't be enough to solve problems in case a critical illness occurs, leaving you exposed in the future. The government is currently cracking down on misleading online insurance sales practices. So, overall, there is no issue with the platform or the products. The real issue lies in the professionalism and ethics of the salespeople. I suggest that you consider this carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies offer a wider range of products, providing more opportunities and choices for customers. Some of their products may even have better cost-performance than online products. I have personally helped 59 internet customers underwrite offline products, saving each of them 2,000-3,000 RMB per year in premiums. If you have any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange ideas with me. I am a Mingya insurance broker with 3 years of experience in corporate management training. I have served nearly a thousand corporate users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies. Before purchasing insurance, I will customize insurance products for clients based on their needs. During the insurance process, I will help clients compare different options and strive to obtain the best underwriting results. After purchasing insurance, I will help clients organize and manage their policies, ensuring peace of mind. I aim to grow together with each client for a lifetime. I hope my answer can help you! According to the definition provided by the insurance regulatory department, online insurance is the type of insurance business where the policyholder can independently complete the entire insurance process after clicking on the insurance link. In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign anything, and neither does the insurance consultant. All steps can be completed by the policyholder independently. Although online insurance purchases may lack a sense of "ceremony" and might not even come with a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effectiveness of the electronic contract. This mode is somewhat similar to the assembly line work of "telephone sales." However, there is a critical issue with purchasing insurance this way - the follow-up services might not keep up. Insurance is usually a long-term contract lasting several decades. When buying insurance, shouldn't we carefully consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services even many years later?
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone accept such personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything except this kind of villain. If we do not consider political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style. Since you started sending me Facebook friend requests, then posting mocking posts, and even attempting to publish my home address and father's name on social media, I have adopted a non-responsive attitude. Later, you intensified your efforts, not only tagging me at the frequency of six meals a day but also continuing to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some obscure, humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, body, fertility, and inappropriate comments about intimacy. I...let it go. However, I later received messages from several friends about a photo of you and comments with sexual harassment elements on your Facebook friend's account. I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After the news of my reporting to the police was published, you did not restrain yourself but became even more arrogant. I don't care about your political background or your social status; in our society, respect between genders is required. Yes, you can continue with these mocking, obscure, humiliating, and abusive remarks; you can continue to say that you only care about and pay attention to me; you can continue to believe that it is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it was not your edited picture or continue to make any aggressive comments.From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, let alone accept such personal attacks.

That's right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you, nor do I want to know you, and my appearance and body certainly don't need your judgment. I don't even think there is any woman who would be willing to endure such humiliation in exchange for fame. Friends ask me, are you okay? I say I'm fine, but you wouldn't believe it. I don't think any woman can say she's fine after being bullied like this. In work, society, politics, or business, only those without basic morals would choose to hurt any woman in this way. I believe that justice lies in the hearts of the people. I have captured some of the comments for everyone to judge. The posts you made yourself should not be impersonated by anyone, right? All I can say is that you are an enemy of civilization, and I can only smile knowingly.
Three US Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China; Most Powerful Weapon Makes Rare Visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Duowei Pro-China media Duowei reports: The latest news on China-US relations: new satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China. US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending important signals to both allies and adversaries of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region. According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform," on January 9th, a satellite spotted the USS Carl Vinson near the Balabac Strait. The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific. The platform predicts that the Carl Vinson will be deployed in the South China Sea. This is the first time the Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft. In addition to the Carl Vinson, the US aircraft carriers currently patrolling the Pacific include the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3rd. The Lincoln is also carrying an F-35C carrier-based squadron for the first time, which belongs to the US Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron. Apart from the aforementioned two carriers, the US Navy has the USS Ronald Reagan deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, currently docked at Yokosuka, Japan. The carrier battle group also includes the USS Chancellorsville missile cruiser and the USS Stockdale missile destroyer, among others. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing three US aircraft carriers gathering around China. (Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) Three US Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China; Most Powerful Weapon Makes Rare Visit to Guam - On January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US Navy's carrier-based transport aircraft CMV-22B. (Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to a CNN report on January 17th, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam over the weekend. The Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the US Naval Base in Guam on Saturday, January 15th. Analysts say this sends a signal to both allies and adversaries in the increasingly tense Indo-Pacific region. This is the first visit of a US ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to the island since the 1980s. In recent years, China has built numerous military facilities in the Spratly Islands. The image shows China's Yongshu Island in the Spratly Islands (South China Sea Research Forum). In a statement, the US Navy said the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, demonstrating US capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines." The whereabouts of the 14 Boomer submarines in the US Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential. The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes "Boomer submarines" the most important survivable weapon in the nuclear triad, which also includes silo-based ballistic missiles located in the continental United States and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
Talking with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock, a market value evaporation of 251 billion dollars, Zuckerberg responds, "facing unprecedented competition." What's the reason? Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its main revenue coming from advertisements. Today's profitable advertising companies have their own traffic channels. Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., regardless of their functional positioning, are all traffic channels for Meta. Not only that, but Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance"; many apps connect to Meta's ads, and monetization is realized through Meta's advertising platform. However, times have changed. First, due to Apple's privacy policy adjustments, it has become difficult for Meta to obtain user data, affecting the efficiency of ad placements. Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, clearly prompting users whether they allow apps to access their information, and most people's natural reaction is not to allow it. If Google takes further action, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater. Second, the China factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it indeed exists). People usually know that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate. At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing overseas business. Meta has an office in Hong Kong with about a few hundred employees, and there are several major agencies in mainland China. When Chinese companies want to expand into overseas markets, Meta is an indispensable advertising channel, with most of the funds being spent on Meta. Interestingly, ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made quite a bit of money from ByteDance in the past couple of years. Various domestic agencies have been helping ByteDance place ads on Meta's platform, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region has been quite good. I haven't specifically looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before. The phase of Chinese companies spending massively overseas has passed. Third, the expansion of new traffic channels has not been smooth. Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TikTok, are not in Meta's hands. The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth prospects. Capital markets not only value revenue but also place greater importance on future prospects. Clearly, Meta's prospects are insufficient. In order to present a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "metaverse". The metaverse indeed should be one of the future directions, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long. This story probably won't be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years. So, the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta. Although Facebook appears to be doing well now, with annual revenues of 100 to 200 billion US dollars, the company actually has a strong sense of crisis. Compared to other internet companies and high-tech firms, it lacks a good and secure moat. Although its social media platforms, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, have high daily active users and are mainstream social media apps, they face the rapid growth of TikTok, and Facebook doesn't have much confidence. The disruption could happen in the blink of an eye. Pursuing the metaverse, a concept that seems out of reach, has no hope of success in the short term, making Facebook very vulnerable. This is why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and is constantly looking for new tracks to compete in. However, I think his choice of track is wrong and is a dead-end path. The above are some of my thoughts, for reference.

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't stick with it, so I want to find a racket with a reasonable price to practice. However, it's not user-friendly; in fact, the price is often positively correlated with the friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the more expensive rackets are usually friendlier than the cheaper ones. These "entry-level" rackets are actually industrial waste. They have low intensity, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is significant, and they can't withstand hard balls. Even skilled players find it difficult to control them. Their existence and underlying message is that tennis is so difficult, they know you won't learn it and that you won't be willing to buy expensive rackets, so they deceive you with cheap ones. You'll play a couple of times and then give up, so the racket is cheap, and you won't feel bad about it. When you can really tell the difference in quality, it means you've improved, and you can come back and buy an expensive one, so they make money twice. It's recommended to spend a similar amount of money on a better-quality used racket, like Prince or Dunlop. These two brands don't have enough fame, so their good rackets don't sell for high prices. A new one for 500-600 is good enough, and a used one for 200 will give you the enjoyment of a thousand-yuan racket. It's friendly for beginners, but once you're past the beginner stage, it becomes useless. However, most people, especially women, don't get past the beginner stage.

What was the hottest thing in 2021? Without a doubt, it was the Tokyo Olympics. Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards? A while ago, a popular article titled "Look! Olympic Events Where Project Managers Can Compete for Gold Medals" mentioned that project managers can absolutely take the lead in many projects, unmatched by others: moving bricks, going on business trips, and staying up late are daily routines for project managers, while putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are just a part of the job. This seemingly joking and sarcastic article actually reveals the daily hardships of project managers, reflecting their struggles in current project management work. People working in project management are increasingly choosing to take action to free themselves from work-related predicaments. The annual increase in the number of PMP (Project Management Professional, an internationally recognized certification) registrations shows that more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning. According to the "China Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019)," as of September 2019, there were nearly 600,000 cumulative PMP exam registrants nationwide, with about 420,000 PMP-certified individuals and approximately 300,000 valid certificate holders, accounting for 31.2% of the global total number of PMP-certified professionals. The number of PMP-certified individuals has increased year by year in the past decade, indicating that more and more project managers realize that simply copying past "old experiences" is no longer feasible. The rapidly changing work environment teaches us that we need to learn, stand on the shoulders of scientific giants, and explore the path forward. However, does obtaining a PMP certification guarantee smooth project management work? Many project management beginners have said that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the knowledge points of the ten major domains and five process groups of project management. However, when it comes to actually managing projects, they still find themselves in a fog. Many project managers often report the following issues: inadequate understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, possessing project management theory but not knowing how to put it into practice; lacking systematic project management processes and support, unable to implement them in their work, inaccurate project estimates, poor control sensitivity, and projects being constantly delayed; unclear division of labor among team members, not knowing how to deal with the "old hands" in the team; poor cross-departmental communication and collaboration, making it difficult for projects to progress. Therefore, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has been focusing on product innovation and R&D management for over a decade and has helped many outstanding enterprises train a large number of product managers, project managers, and other key R&D personnel, and has won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base," is launching the "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course. This online course offers a fragmented learning approach, combining numerous practical cases, tools, and methods from R&D-oriented enterprises to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project management and advance in your own project management journey. It also provides an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, bringing about efficient operational results. Don't just take our word for it. You can see how other students evaluate the course: The course is not only delivered by the expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (formerly Huawei R&D management team), combining international advanced project management methodologies and real business scenarios from many well-known enterprises for in-depth and easy-to-understand professional explanations of the course content. It also provides practical and scientific management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms, to help students apply what they have learned to their specific work after the course.

Priced at nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, with an annual road tax of tens of thousands of Ringgit, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700? Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast that is? Well, I don't know either, but the data says it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100 km/h, which is about the time my Myvi takes to reach 30 km/h when others are already at 100 km/h, hmm. The low-slung body, aggressive scissor doors, massive air intakes all around, and the unobstructed view of the 6.5 V12 engine under the glass perfectly embody the Lamborghini style. There's not much need to say about the car's features; you can just Google it. I've compiled some explanations that Google may not provide! It attracts too much attention, and everyone looks wherever you go, making it uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of cool) The fuel cost for 1 km is around RM1 (the car owner doesn't really care). Practice getting in and out of the car, or it might be a bit embarrassing (because you might not be able to climb out of the cockpit and get stuck halfway). The engine noise is so loud that you may suddenly go deaf after getting out of the car. (But it's still very exhilarating) The car is so large that parking in a regular parking space feels narrow, and you're afraid of being hit by the neighboring car's door when they open it! It's a bit lonely because there are no rivals on the road (I say this myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha). Please don't misunderstand; the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry! If you want to shoot a video for your beloved car, feel free to contact us!

I believe car enthusiasts are familiar with both the Chiron, one of the world's most expensive supercars, and the Porsche 911, which is also priced in the millions! The other day, in just a few minutes, a million-dollar sports car, the 911, and a ten-million-dollar supercar, the Chiron, were wrecked in a foreign country! Looking at the outcome, there's a good reason for the high price!
As NFTs quickly gain popularity, a new concept emerges in the crypto community. In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a significant impact in Southeast Asia, providing a stable income for some residents who lost job opportunities due to the pandemic. "Axie Infinity" is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, featuring various gameplay elements, including NFTs, and is currently the highest-grossing NFT project, with total transactions exceeding $3 billion. TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily revenue exceeds $8.2 million, approaching the popular game "Honor of Kings." On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity's official account claimed that its daily active users had surpassed 1 million. The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has introduced a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer single-purpose characters, and in addition to enjoying the game and reaping economic benefits, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem. This subjectivity is not granted by the game developer but guaranteed by blockchain technology. Upon seeing a piece of news about a friend's stock price, my biggest takeaway is that a company's choice of track, or the choice of the industry it invests in, should first consider industries with significant growth potential, at least a market size of over $100 billion; second, choose industries with strong future growth prospects, considering industries that will reach their peak growth in the next 3-5 years; and finally, choose industries with government support. The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is smooth or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry. Let's cheer for the right track! In the new year, the first thing to do is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022. Tactics are about "doing things right," which means doing things correctly. Strategy, on the other hand, is about "doing the right thing," which means undertaking the correct actions. Strategy is about finding direction, while tactics focus on implementation. In most tactical considerations, there is room for strategic thinking. For example, when considering how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), one can think about whether to continue deepening in the current field or to expand horizontally into other areas (strategic thinking); when trying to improve customer retention rates (tactical thinking), one can consider how to enhance the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); when working on increasing event participation (tactical thinking), it's important to set the right event KPIs, achieve the right event goals, such as improving target customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; and when increasing DAU (tactical thinking), one can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable. In its 12-year history, Bitcoin has experienced several milestone events in 2021. On September 7, the Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, marking the first time that Bitcoin has become legal currency in a country or region. On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved for the first time in eight years the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the arrival of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF in the U.S. capital market, further expanding the exposure to cryptocurrency investments. From a blockchain technology development perspective, Bitcoin is not the main protagonist. On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which improved the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.
Have you encountered any issues with continuing education hours for the initial registration of a first-level cost engineer? For overdue registrants who have not provided continuing education proof, they should provide proof of at least 30 hours of continuing education in the past year. For re-registration, they should provide proof of at least 120 hours of continuing education in the past four years, and for each full year, they should provide proof of at least 30 hours of continuing education. The standard cost for continuing education for cost engineers is as follows: For those who participate in online continuing education, they must pay the learning fee to the management organizations when registering. Generally, the standard fee is 300 RMB per person per year for 30 hours of compulsory courses (including unified continuing education textbooks), and 300 RMB per person per year for 30 hours of elective courses. The fee for both 30 hours of compulsory courses and 30 hours of elective courses is 600 RMB per person per year (including unified continuing education textbooks). (1) For those who participate in online continuing education for registered cost engineers organized by the China Pricing Association, provincial or departmental management organizations, the learning hours are calculated based on the recorded time of online learning materials; (2) For those who participate in centralized face-to-face training and various types of training courses, seminars, etc., organized by the China Pricing Association, provincial or departmental management organizations, 4 hours can be recognized for each half-day session; (3) For those who participate in continuing education lectures for cost engineers and cost estimators organized by the China Pricing Association, provincial or departmental management organizations, 10 hours can be recognized for each half-day session; (4) For those who participate in research projects, industry standard development, and textbook writing organized by the China Pricing Association and provincial organizations, 30 hours can be recognized for each project per year.

After the registration organization receives the cost engineer's online continuing education fee, the student's identity is activated immediately, and the cost engineer can enter the online education classroom for learning using their username and password. Students can learn through methods such as watching courseware on-demand, asking questions, and participating in online discussions. If students forget their password and cannot log in due to incorrect usernames or passwords, they should contact their respective registration organizations. The registration organization can help modify the student's password (but not the username), allowing them to log in again with the updated password. Scan the QR code to download the Tieba client.
