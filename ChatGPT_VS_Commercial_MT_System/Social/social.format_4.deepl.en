In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from the housing agency about a plant located in the town of Zhejiang Yuyao zhangting, and after several site visits, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu on the details of the purchase of the plant and the family of the owner of the house Linmou after consultation, on the same day by bank transfer remittance of 200,000 yuan for the deposit. Linmou in the "plant sale deposit receipt" as the payee signature, which contains, "If the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this deposit to the seller, such as the seller is not willing to sell this plant, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, the two sides agreed to sign the plant sale contract within a week." However, after the two sides failed to form a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of plant sales, payment methods, resulting in the delay in the signing of the contract for the sale of housing. Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu. It is easy to look at the house, the deposit paid, the house is also ready, just "a foot in the door" to sign the contract, the seller is not sold, which makes Mr. Lu helpless and angry. For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Mr. Lin to the Yuyao City People's Court. The court heard that the parties eventually failed to sign a formal contract, can not be attributed to the defendant alone, should be reasonably presumed to negotiate, so the case should not apply the deposit penalty, the defendant does not need to bear double the return of the deposit for breach of contract liability. After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal. Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict. 【Lawyer reminder】 Do the necessary prudent attention in the transaction process. When signing the contract, as a buyer to do the necessary prudent attention obligations, for example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied and other related information, and in the contract clearly about the specific time and place of delivery, to prevent disputes between the two sides when performing the contract.
Your name is Zheng Mian and it's your second week since you moved to Japan. You are walking down the street and suddenly you notice someone following you, you walk faster and faster in fear and finally run. The person chases after you, "Miss! Please wait!" (The whole conversation is in Japanese) You stop in front of the convenience store. "Miss ...... I'm a director, I see you're very pretty, would you be interested in a reality show?" You're confused and afraid this is a scam. He slips you a business card and you find out that he really is a director for a major Japanese entertainment company. "Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to talk about it, and the pay will be no less." You follow him to the company in a daze, and he says he saw you on the street at first glance and would very much like you to come and participate. You think there is nothing to lose, but also to make money, so you signed a contract. This is a big relationship reality show, divided into two parts. The first phase will let the celebrities and vegetarians get along in real life and develop a tacit understanding. In the second phase, they will enter into the game to break through the levels together. The official recording will start next week, you don't know who your partner will be and what interesting things will happen.
To start with the conclusion, I personally think "Four Seas" is an all-around bad movie, in every sense of the word. But you have to say that the film is not a highlight, it is not at least the soundtrack is well chosen. There are many kinds of bad movies, those that make you sleep soundly in the cinema, and those that make you feel angry after watching them. In insulting the audience, Han Han is really gifted. The most painful thing about this film is that it seems like a creation from a gram-novel, unnamable, with as many holes as a trench coat on a pony. Even after watching it you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director in it, but when you think about it carefully you find it is actually a piece of shit. First of all, I'd like to briefly mention some of the plot points that I have a hard time understanding. The main character lives on an island in the south, and his grandmother is dependent on him. Her grandmother has a wish to see snow, and then the plot is arranged in the neighborhood of a grandfather driving a minivan to send her to the northeast to see the snow. Senior citizen in a van from the south to the northeast to see snow? He and his dad were still very relieved about it. Then the old man didn't follow. In the abandoned ship to open a hotel, the heroine his brother how to get a business license? Why can the island biker party punks easily do a section of the mountain road to close the road? Then the middle of the road to send rebar trucks parked on the side of the road, surrounded by even truck drivers can not find. This sense of prop is too obvious, right? A credit can not and suspected of breaking the law of the punk flyers why will become an auxiliary police? In the face of loan sharks why not call the police, the film police also specifically asked whether there is a difficult situation? An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to use the room card to open the door in the hotel, and then forcefully arranged to find the hotel owner, sitting outside the room door to sleep overnight? This kind of inexplicable plot is filled throughout the film, and because the plot is so outrageous that it pains me to recall them. In addition to the plot, what is worse is the main idea of the movie, or rather the movie has no main idea at all, it is a stitching monster with an abominable face. The beginning of the film you will think he wanted to make a comedy film, after 20 minutes or so you guess it may be an inspirational film, watch half of it you think it may be a drama to reflect the survival of small town youth is not easy, after watching you do not know what they actually watched, followed by deep suspicion of their own, the New Year's why to run to the cinema to enjoy the poop. For most people are actually very familiar with all kinds of film formula, such as you want to shoot motorcyclists, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie step by step to success. If you want to make a romance, then you can honestly talk about the feud between a small town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and a waitress girl. If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot should not appear to be contrary to the normal world. (For example, Yin Zheng played the role of the new motorcycle just burned, and then can still sing), you can not go to open some even JFK looked at the brain hole can not be. As for the female lead is obviously not retarded but in some ways behaves like a 5 year old, I really don't know if this is due to acting or the director's requirements. There is one more thing I don't understand, Han Han as a race car driver why he is so keen to add crash scenarios in his own movies? This kind of movie is scheduled in the Spring Festival, is it to add to the audience?
I accidentally saw the following article, from the perspective of business and shelf life, why the customer wanted the logistics company inside the bonded zone to help do the canning, although the canning belongs to the deep processing, does not belong to the scope of business of bonded logistics companies, here the following text may explain why the customer wanted to do so? I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines. In fact, the raw materials of the milk powder in bags and listened to are exactly the same, there is no difference between them. Then people will surely ask: Why is the shelf life of the bagged milk powder one year, while the shelf life of the listened milk powder is two years or longer? Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big? In fact, from this point on many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different so the quality will be much better. In fact, the raw materials are the same, but we think the expensive is good. There are also consumers out of this mindset after eating the reaction also said listen to the taste or flavor is not the same! Now I'll talk to you first about the reason for listening to the expensive, expensive where? They are the same raw materials why the price difference is so big? Because most of the manufacturers in the pricing time to consider if the bag pricing is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that manufacturers generate very low profits, or no profit, then manufacturers rely on what to survive? So they have a large increase in the pricing of listening to the package to protect their profit margin. Therefore most manufacturers are mainly pushing the listened to, rather than bagged. There are so many manufacturers you want to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year on advertising, the cost of where? We can imagine. Then with the development of society, the market promotion costs, such as: shopping mall promoters, shopping mall display costs, product giveaway costs, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing. So various manufacturers are also increasing the new products, and is listening to the suit, its price is also rising, in fact, this is with the increase in market costs out of the new products. The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials to increase the cost of up to no more than 3, 4 yuan. There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, by any means, linked with the hospital doctors, they assist in the promotion of the product, from a hear inside the profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan. The relevant Chinese laws absolutely do not allow such a method of operation, in fact, this practice is to harm consumers. It is recommended that you buy bags of milk powder in cans at home on the premise that this can save money, while increasing the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and there is no effect on small children. There are also people who do not think that the shelf life of listening to the bag is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of listening to the bag and the bag is the same after opening the bag, only that the bag is not easy to save after opening the bag, easy to moisture deterioration.
I just came across an article on menstrual leave that is too long. Here's some information for the men who don't know. Most girls suddenly experience their first period sometime between the ages of 13-15 and menopause around age 50. After that, they will come more regularly once a month, provided they are healthy. However, it is not so regular that it can be precisely predicted, with a tolerance of about a week, which requires advance preparation, and sometimes bad luck can roll over (suddenly several days early). The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of menstrual pain vary from person to person, some people have three days, some a week; some have little flow, some have a big bloodbath; some have little reaction, some have pain until the ambulance transports them away. Menstrual pain changes over time, and just because it didn't hurt before doesn't mean it won't hurt for the rest of your life. Menstruation cannot be controlled, bleeding 24 hours a day for a few days from the beginning to the end. All you can do is to use a sanitary napkin or tampon to absorb the blood to prevent it from flowing onto your clothes and chair. The main reason for menstrual cramps is the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen at the beginning of the physiological period before the menstrual cramps start can effectively relieve the pain of the month, but there is nothing to eat after the menstrual cramps start. It is easy to have diarrhea before the physiological period due to the congestion of the uterus and excessive release of prostaglandins. If it is about time for your cycle and you have diarrhea inexplicably, you will basically get your period within two days. Tampons are best replaced once every two or three hours, otherwise they are prone to bacterial growth, excluding sleep time, the worst case is to replace six times a day, seven days a month, that is 42 pieces, if you add the copies prepared in advance may have 50 pieces, and not one piece per month. (modified here, tampons do not have to change often, about five or six hours to change once on, the longest eight hours) menstrual hormones may be more irritable, ovulation will also be because of the hormonal changes in the body emotional instability, is very unlucky, the body to their own trip. But the official crime rate data can see that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and will not take emotional problems to make excuses. The flow is not just blood, which contains the shed endometrium. After the end of menstruation, the uterine lining is the thinnest, after slowly thicken, can be understood as the uterus is a house, each month to build a house (lining thickened) ready to welcome guests, guests did not come, all demolished (menstrual discharge) next month to build a new house, and so on and so forth. Menstruation is inconvenient, continuous for decades, bleeding 24 hours a day for several days a month, and abdominal pain and back pain, who wants it? But a person can be born because his mother had menstruation, and menstruation is to prepare the house you will live in for 10 months when you first come into the world, and everyone should be grateful that their mother had menstruation regularly and healthily. A lot of things about women used to be suppressed, society brainwashed women that it was dirty and shameful, and people thought that's what it was, but times have changed. If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the act of preparing a woman's body for the conception of life is disgusting and should not be said in public, girls stand up and stop thinking that way, men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in this life and do not know much about it, do not be so ungrateful and unaware, how can you face your own mother with this attitude and how can you want to have your own children? Finally, the sisters try tampons, really good.
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through perception by means of rational reasoning and logic. Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy that aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world. The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "Those who are above in form are called the Way, those who are below in form are called the Weapon" in the I Ching (Yijing), which was translated from metaphysic by the Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era). (Meiji era). The branch of metaphysics includes ontology, natural theology and its extensions. Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities of existence and which nouns represent only concepts. Metaphysical naturalism is the denial of the existence of God. It is based on the idea that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, and is proposed by philosophers who support science and evolutionary theory. Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to an approach to the study of God that does not say anything about God. Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and their relationship with the physical body (especially the brain). Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the "relationship between mind and body". Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge. Ethics is the discipline of systematic reflection and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all codes of behavior recognized by a group of people or a culture. It is mainly divided into metaethics (the study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism in the abstract), normative ethics (the critique of different moral views and the giving of moral code recommendations for right or wrong behavior. It studies the style of moral behavior that people should follow, applied ethics, which applies ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics and political ethics, and descriptive ethics, which gathers information about how people live and summarizes it from observed patterns. It examines ethics not in terms of preconceived theories but in terms of the real choices made and observed by actual moral agents, all the moral factors that contribute to those choices, and the ethical views held by social groups. The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics. Part I: Humanist ethical thought, represented by Walla and Montaigne and others. Part II: The ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin. The third part: ethics of politics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17th-18th centuries, British empiricist ethics, represented by Hume and others, 17th-18th centuries, continental rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza and others, 18th centuries, French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire and others, 18th-19th centuries, German academic ethics, represented by (Kant and Hegel, etc.), 18th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics (Bianchin and Sidgwick, etc.), 19th century, British evolutionary ethics (Spencer and Huxley, etc.), late 19th century, German neo-Kantian ethics (Li Keil, etc.), late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics (Thomas Hill Green, etc.), and transitional ethics (Kant and Hegel, etc.). In the late 19th century, neo-Hegelian ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.), and transitional ethics (irrationalist ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, etc.). Logic is the study of "principles and criteria of valid inference and proof". Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, retrospective reasoning and deductive reasoning, and can be divided into formal and non-formal logic. Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the nature of beauty and its meaning.
Ding Zilin: To our friends. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you for the humanitarian assistance you have provided for more than 30 years since our loved ones were killed, especially since I made a personal appeal to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, which has not been interrupted so far. Today, the majority of the victims' elderly parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and become employed. It is your kindness that has helped our bereaved families through the most difficult times. Now that the New Guinea epidemic is raging around the world, most of our donors have reached retirement. Therefore, I earnestly request that you stop your humanitarian donations to the Tiananmen Mothers, our hard-luck family, as it is long past time to bring this humanitarian campaign to a perfect conclusion. I will always remember your love and am convinced that your act of charity will be remembered by history. For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, so please understand my friends! Please accept my sincere blessings. Tao Ye Press: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the All American Federation of Students for Self Study (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Foundation for Democracy (MCDF) in humanitarian relief. In engaging in humanitarian relief, ACSL and the Minnesota Foundation for Chinese Democracy are two parallel organizations, with program implementers often crossing over. (Apple Daily photo: The Tiananmen Mothers website is run by Tao Ye.) pic.twitter.com We will respect the decision of the families to terminate this program in two years and resume it as soon as needed. To those fellow chivalrous people who have persisted in their generosity and risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid over the years, we express our gratitude and respect.
A programming white who wants to share his personal experience. If you are planning to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you do not have this idea, it is best to learn on your own, after all, the training to spend a lot of money, and also with 6 months of time to learn. But if you are planning to enter the pit in this industry, then training is really a very good choice, especially those who have weak self-control and training is a very good choice. If your own self-control is stronger, you can also choose to learn on your own, but will be more tired. Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing. The first thing to look at this institution's faculty, if the faculty is not strong enough, this training institution is not very meaningful, of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong faculty. Secondly, before choosing to explore this training institution, it is best to explore the students who came out of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution will know how this institution in the end, explain the course is good or bad. Hello, in fact, you ask this question I do not know how to answer, because your own situation does not do a certain introduction, and learning this thing and the individual's own situation has a lot to do with the. For example, your major, your age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of these will have a relationship with the industry you want to study or work in. If you are a student and have not graduated, or a computer professional has graduated, then if you have enough time I personally recommend self-learning, this is the least efficient and costly, now a lot of offline online training institutions are actually very good, but a high cost of learning, the second investment of time is more, the basic need to focus on training 3-6 months. But if these are the cases I mentioned, self-study is very convenient, and now many learning resources on the network are free, or go to the b site also has a lot of training resources, if you will not find resources, you can also contact me through the profile to get free resources, or detailed consultation is also OK. In addition, there are some more classic books can be combined with video integrated learning. If you are not a computer professional, but also able to pay a certain amount of money and time cost of learning, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn, so that learning does not have to be very laborious, the teacher explained in detail, there are also people dedicated to answering questions, in addition to learning planning or supervision is also helpful. And now a lot of training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal promotion quota, after learning to recommend to the company, so that the back of the job search interview link can also save a lot of things. The above is my opinion, because I do not understand your situation, so only about the introduction is not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can always contact me for communication.
I, undertake a variety of (installation, cleaning, repair), wall-hung water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, hoods, installation of lamps, glass cleaning, professional seamstress, housekeeping services Thank you to those who silently give me praise , in order to live hard to fight life is very tired but to continue life will not fail every person who works hard , like it follow me , thank you to those who silently give me praise life is This way, others only look at the results, their own sole support process, the face of life, we are strong, in addition to continue, there is no choice, the road can look back but can not go back ...... cleaning is a job, but also a duty, life is beautiful because of service, service because of the heart and wonderful.

Give me the opportunity to make sure you are satisfied, quality says it all, because the professional deserves to be trusted, your recognition is my most encouraged! All walks of life today are not good to do ah! But I always believe that as long as the serious attitude, enough persistence, enough effort, I will be a little better than others, at least better than sitting around complaining about it "! The plan of the day is in the morning, all the beauty from the early morning Hope you carry happy, lucky, healthy, as you wish to start a new day, keep a good mood all day Good morning as a child, happiness is a thing, have on happiness; after growing up, happiness is a goal, achieve on happiness; mature found that happiness is a state of mind, comprehend on happiness.

Secondly, although the rightists have aspirations in history, but not for a long time, so short because a little sunshine will be brilliant, drink some boiling water will sweat; a little ambition will be to get a long hope, by the blow will be hair will be attached. But realistically speaking, the rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress. The positive significance of the Right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection. Third, for my part, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I care about what he says and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious about China and he is serious about China's social problems. However, I am against his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihood, mixed political groups and mud, and then foreign countries will take advantage of the situation. Fourth, change or improve China must have patience and responsible attitude for the country and the people, political speculation in an attempt to take the chestnuts in the fire, that is not the right, is an asshole. Talk about the left again. The left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics. If the right has a positive meaning to society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their ideas when needed, then the left does not have this creation, because what the left wants is exactly the dregs that the Communist Party throws away! Five, recently saw some friends dislike the anti-thief while refuting the left epilepsy, but also quite moving real gas, I think it is not necessary. Do not try to reason with the traitor and the left epileptic, they are a tendency to be unreasonable. And don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the traitor and the left epileptic admit it, why bother? I tell my friends this: when the rebels call you fifty cents, when the left epileptic calls you a right dog, it just proves that this middle way of ours is correct! Many people have ideals when they are teenagers, but when they are old, they forget them, or pursue them, but they are reduced to paranoia. And the ideal drifted away, and even dragon slaying teenagers eventually become the evil dragon. Left and right I think generally refers to restraint and freedom, China from the history and culture of the innate genes leading to China as a whole should be left. The domestic right is free, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left strengthens regulation and pays more attention to fairness as well as security. Now society in general wants to pay more attention to fairness, while China and the United States are fighting each other, the left is certain, it is estimated to continue for many years. Although you can't read it, the point of praise on the end of the matter what not to say, flowers is so righteous
In the past two years, the U.S. empire's blockade and siege of Huawei chip, not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also let the "U.S. system" enterprises suffered huge losses. The U.S. empire suppressed China's chip industry, requiring its own enterprises and allies to block China's chip industry at the same time, a direct consequence is that the global chip suppliers' orders and profits have been affected, resulting in lower investment in research and development and lower production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a global shortage of disruption in the chip supply chain. Now the "lack of core" has spread to all major industries around the world, such as car companies to stop production, cell phone prices, almost all the industries that use chips are deeply affected by it. In order to grasp the "chip" autonomy, more and more countries' technology giants began to "go to the beautification" of the road. In order to firmly control the global control of semiconductors, to control the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States recently moved a lot, and host the "chip summit"; and invited 64 countries to set up a semiconductor alliance, and pull money to support the U.S. domestic technology giants, for example, the old U.S. empire technology giant Intel in order to recapture the dominant position in the field of chips For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, Intel spent $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, the United States, and open up the chip foundry business to the public. When most people thought that Intel's move will have some impact on TSMC, and is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl". The reason why so sure, because Intel as the United States empire old technology giant, in the field of semiconductor deep decades, has a large number of talent team and technology reserves, will be able to quickly rise in the short term, to defeat TSMC. However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was not impressed. In the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement, for Intel to spend money to build fabs this move, Zhang Zhongmou no scruples to say: Intel build chip foundry, quite ironic. The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still harbors a grudge against TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago. In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel had been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the U.S. Empire, majestically occupying the position of the global pinnacle, the world's hegemon in the field of semiconductors. By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been in the hands of a few powerful players. At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured and packaged by a single factory, and Intel was a representative of that era. However, such a model overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only be deterred by the huge production line construction costs. Inspired by market demand, the chip industry began to see a division of labor and cooperation after entering the 1980s. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were those specializing in design, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established. Soon after, Chang's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born. TSMC aimed its main business at "wafer processing" as a single segment, not designing but only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing. At that time, TSMC was a small minion in front of the giant Intel. In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had sought investment from Intel, but at that time, once Intel heard that TSMC was only doing the manufacturing part of the chip industry, it was obvious that some of them thought highly of themselves and looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC. Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on the wafer fabrication services at that time. I didn't expect that the giant who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then would now start doing wafer foundry. So, Zhang Zhongmou finds it ironic that Intel has entered the foundry. Now TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's. In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to stand still. Today, TSMC has been sprinting toward 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck in the 14nm 7 years ago. trying to catch up is actually not easy.
Look at some [strange hot topics] today. What is a normal public opinion? Randomly pick three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raising Head, Holliday's Price Increase, and Cargo Lala Incident, and the public opinion spreads to form a wave, then [exponential decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, and a small hump will appear again if secondary public opinion is generated. They look similar to the [evolution model of online public opinion] once shown on the official website of the Internet Information Office. What is an unusual public opinion? Six randomly selected hot searches in the same event show [solitary peak-like], [sawtooth-like], and [cliff-like]. The [lonely peak] is artificially heated, which quickly rushes to the top of the hot search list and attracts public attention; the [jagged tooth] is periodically heated, ensuring that the topic is coiled in the hot search list; the [cliff] is collectively withdrawn, and the hot search has finished its "function" and received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.  ... The specialization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for science, which lead to war to create momentum, which divert attention, which influence perception, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, which hostage decision, black production accounts in batches, sub-nodes of refined combat, taking into account almost all elements of the spread of public opinion. Communication is a science, put aside all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will also have nowhere to hide. All walks must leave traces, such traces, we dig out together. Data source: Hot Search Time Machine.
What are the differences between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of market positioning? To my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to the LCD TV, and laser TV and LCD TV in the market positioning differences, mainly the following two points: First, laser TV more focused on the large screen market. Compared to the LCD TV full-scale market positioning, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen. At present, the mainstream LCD TV size more in 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of the laser TV is generally more than 75 inches, the largest more than 100 inches, fully meet the user demand for large screen color TV. In recent years, the laser TV in the global shipments and sales accounted for an increasing proportion of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above accounted for more than 60%. According to the forecast of CEC, in 2020, laser TV market sales growth will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain high growth. The reason for such good results in the large-screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of laser TVs in eye protection. Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted from the laser light source is not directly into the eye, compared to the backlight luminescence of LCD TVs, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulus to the eyes is also smaller. China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute Sai Xi Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital ophthalmology experts, through the crowd under the same conditions to watch the laser TV and LCD TV rigorous comparison test, resulting in 144 sets of test data. The data confirms: laser TV does have strong eye-protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement in specific aspects. At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV not only attracts more and more users by virtue of the eye protection advantage, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market. Second, the laser TV more focused on high-end market. In contrast to LCD TV prices continue to dip, the current price of commercially available laser TVs are mostly above 10,000 yuan, with the size and light source upgrades, the price gradually climb. What makes laser TV sell so expensive? There must be a reason. Under the continuous development of light source and technology level, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TV and projection can not achieve. With ultra-short focal length projection technology, laser TV projection distance is shorter compared to traditional projection equipment, to achieve a 100-inch large screen experience in a short distance, the space required is not large, and the host is small, taking up very little space. In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens. Plus the heat generation is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the life of the TV is longer. In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience. Not to talk about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio-visual players, want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment is not enough, you can try, everything has its pros and cons, after weighing their own judgment can be, afraid to listen to one side of the story. Simply put, ultra-wide angle near focus projector - laser TV, in order to close to the curtain, had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lens and reflector, which does not meet the optical best design. In order to shield some of the ambient light, the use of micro-structured Fresnel curtains is costly, and the price of 80" can basically replace a 65" LCD. One more thing, I especially hate projection manufacturers to take diffuse reflection on the eyes as a selling point, come on, the eyes can see the light on the curtain for the eyes is direct light, you diffuse reflection to the ceiling, the eyes can not see, have to be serious LCD TV is also diffuse "direct", turn on the TV ceiling is not also illuminated? And, the projection curtain if not diffuse reflection, simply can not become like. Just ignored the high gain curtain hot spot (light spot) effect, a certain angle a lot of light reflected to the eyes, that is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance under a small umbrella? Little Umbrella is an Internet-based insurance brokerage platform. From the set-up conditions: according to the "Insurance Brokerage Institutions Supervision Regulations (2015 Revision)" tips, to become an insurance brokerage company, you must meet three key words: shareholders, the promoters of the last three years without major illegal records, the minimum limit of RMB 50 million to be established, and must be agreed by the CIRC. These three is actually very harsh, summed up is to have the strength, to be approved by the CBIRC (regulation of insurance companies, banks within the country) of the state authority, shareholders should have good style, as an insurance brokerage company of the small umbrella insurance, the insured is not too much to question the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these 3 thresholds, not what insurance companies can reach. At this point, it's not bad, it's trustworthy. From the point of view of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest on the shelves of Hetai Super Mary 5 critical illness insurance, claims and underwriters are Hetai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, do not need to question its reliability. From the point of view of the payment model: Internet platform products, because less business network operating costs, and the cost of salesmen's wages, so the Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and flexible payment methods, support for monthly payments, to reduce the pressure of the policyholder's payments, while you can maximize the leveraging of insurance. This is still a very good point. You can consider. From the point of view of the professionalism of the salesman: this is particularly important, because insurance is a very strong professionalism requirements of the industry, many Internet products customers can insure themselves, there will be a lot of misunderstandings, in the health information and occupation of this section, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when taking out insurance, think they are healthy or in line, so there are easy to have a lot of claims hidden danger, there may be The risk of denial of claims. I myself have done insurance telemarketing in "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like Little Umbrella, also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can tell you very responsibly. Internet insurance is real and reliable, but what is not reliable is the people, there are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are many misleading sales. For example: 1 yuan insurance to protect 6 million, buy insurance to send cell phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness coverage, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the important, will not tell the insured, the first month of 1 yuan, the next month is required to pay the normal charges, ranging from a few dozen to 200, many customers deducted a year or two of their own buy a what is not clear. Think you can spend 1 dollar, the insurance company to pay 6 million (the world fell pie). Free cell phones, is the policy tail number such as 6666, 8888 such special policy number to send, and if the winning SMS issued, they do not exchange, and no one to remind the. (This is another pit for the insured) free to receive 60,000 critical illness coverage, is a short-term, if only rely on this, no other commercial insurance, in case of a real serious illness, 60,000 can do, can not solve the problem, the future of life began to run naked. At present, the state is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales. So a comprehensive view, the platform is no problem, the product is also no problem, there is a problem is the professionalism and professional conduct of the salesman. It is recommended that the subject consider carefully, in fact, many offline insurance brokers have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products are better than the Internet products in terms of cost performance. I myself have helped 59 Internet customers, underwriting offline products, premium savings of 2,000-3,000 yuan each If you have any questions, welcome to communicate and exchange with me. I: Ming Ya insurance broker, have 3 years of experience in business management training, served nearly 1,000 corporate users, cooperation with more than 100 insurance companies, before the insurance, I will start from the customer needs, customized insurance products for customers, in the insurance, for customers to compare three, try to get the best underwriting results for customers, after the insurance, for customers to do policy organization, policy trust, so that customers rest assured worry-free. We will grow with each customer for life. I hope my answer can be of help to the subject! According to the definition of the insurance regulator, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can complete all the insurance process independently after clicking on the insurance link. In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign and the insurance consultant does not need to sign, all the steps can be done by the policyholder independently. Although the Internet insurance is not too "ritual", and may not even have a printed paper contract, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract. This model, which is somewhat similar to the general assembly line operation of "telemarketing", can be a fatal problem in buying insurance, and that is - the follow-up service may not be able to keep up. Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, so when we buy insurance, shouldn't we seriously think about whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that will be with us for a long time and provide services to us even after many years? Is it an "insurance intermediary" that will be with us for a long time and will provide us with services for many years?
From before to now, I am against any kind of slander and abuse, not to mention the unacceptability of such personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but it is this kind of villainy that must be eliminated. If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style. From the time you started sending Facebook friend requests, to your flirtatious posts, to your attempts to post my alleged home location and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive attitude. You have since intensified your efforts not only to keep tagging me as often as six meals a day, but also to continue to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook with impudent and humiliating comments about me, my looks, my body, my fertility, my growing strawberries in bed, my need for penetration, etc. I... I didn't mind. But then I received a number of messages from friends about your Facebook friend account posting a picture of you and sexual harassment comments. I'm sorry, but as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore. After the news of me calling the police was published, you did not stop at all, but became more and more arrogant. I don't care what your political affiliation is, or what your status is, in our society, there is a need for respect for both genders. Yes, you can continue with the flirtatious, subtle, humiliating, abusive comments, you can continue to say that you are just caring and concerned about me, you can continue to argue that it is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that you made the picture or continue to make all the offensive comments. That's right, I can't and don't have the power to stop you. I neither know you, nor do I want to know you, and I don't need you to judge me for my looks and body. I don't even think any girl would be willing to let someone humiliate her so much in exchange for fame. My friend asked me how I was doing. You wouldn't believe me if I said yes. I don't think there is any girl who can say she is okay after being bullied like that. Whether at work, in society, in politics or in business, only those who don't even have basic moral character would choose to hurt any woman in this way. I believe that justice is in the eye of the beholder. I've cut off some of the messages for you to comment on your own posting there should be no one to impersonate you I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization will heartily smile
U.S. Three Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China, Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Dovetail Pro-China Media Dovetail reports: The latest news on U.S.-China relations: the latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; the U.S. media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, releasing important signals to U.S. allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region. According to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, satellites spotted the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the vicinity of the Balabac Strait on Jan. 9. The Strait of Barabac, which connects the South China Sea to the Sulu Sea, is a strategic point in the first island chain in the Western Pacific. The platform anticipates that the Carl Vinson will deploy to the South China Sea. This is the first deployment of the carrier USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 Fish Hawk carrier aircraft. The U.S. carriers now cruising in the Pacific, in addition to the USS Carl Vinson, are the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on Jan. 3. "The USS Abraham Lincoln also carried for the first time a squadron of F-35C aircraft, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Attack Squadron. In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier docked in Yokosuka, Japan. The carrier battle group also includes the guided missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain and the guided missile destroyer USS Stockdal. Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China, Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam On Jan. 17, 2022, the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform released the latest satellite images showing three U.S. aircraft carriers gathering around China. (Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China in a rare visit to Guam by the most powerful weapons January 17, 2022, flight path of U.S. naval carrier CMV-22B. (Weibo @SouthSeaStrategic Situational Awareness) Another CNN report reported on Jan. 17 that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam over the weekend. The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. Naval Base Guam on Saturday (Jan. 15). Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China in a rare visit to Guam, the most powerful weapon, a signal to allies and foes in the increasingly tense Indo-Pacific region, according to analysis. It was the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to the island since the 1980s. Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Rally Around China's Most Powerful Weapons Make Rare Visit to Guam China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years. Pictured here is China's Yongxia Island in the Spratly Islands. (South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada's visit to Guam strengthens cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, readiness and ongoing commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Ballistic missile submarines are commonly referred to as "Boomer submarines. The whereabouts of the 14 Boomer submarines in the U.S. Navy's fleet are normally kept strictly secret. The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the Thunder Submarine "the most important survivable weapon of the nuclear trinity," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, and its revenue mainly comes from advertising. Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of function positioning, all are Meta's traffic channels. Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", and many apps are connected to Meta's ads to realize cash through Meta's advertising platform. However, the times have changed. First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get the data information of users, which affects the efficiency of ad placement. Apple's privacy policy is very user-friendly now, and will obviously prompt users whether to allow the App to get their own information. The next stab from Google will have an even greater impact on Meta's revenue. Second, the China factor, which used to be part of Meta's revenue growth, has been weakened (not sure how much, but it's there). We all know that Meta has no business in China, but this is not an accurate understanding. Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, which is mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing business overseas; Meta's office in Hong Kong has about a few hundred people, and there are several major agencies in mainland China. It is interesting to note that byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta has made a lot of money from byte in the past two years. All the domestic agencies are helping Byte to advertise with Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good. I haven't looked into it recently, but it's definitely not better than before. The stage of Chinese companies burning money in overseas has passed. Third, new traffic channels are not expanding smoothly. facebook is getting old, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands. The biggest problem is not just a decline in revenue, but a lack of growth expectations. The capital market is not only interested in revenue, but also in future expectations. It was clear that Meta's expectations were not enough. In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "meta-universe". Meta-universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of Meta-universe is rather long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years. So the next two years should be a relatively difficult period for Meta. Don't look at Facebook now is very beautiful, also has 100 billion to 200 billion dollars of revenue every year, in fact Facebook now is very strong sense of crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good security moat. Although his several social software is now a relatively high daily activity, but also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but the face of tiktok's rapid development, Facebook also has little confidence, subversion between the blink of an eye. And engage in the meta-universe this unattainable concept, a short period of time there is absolutely no hope of success, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg and change the name of the company, and constantly looking for a new track the fundamental reason, but I think his track selection is wrong, is a road of no return The above are some of my thoughts for reference.

I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a similarly priced racket to practice with first. Not friendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can not tell, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap racket, this kind of "starter racket" is actually industrial waste. They have very low strength, and when the ball hits the top of the racket, the vibration is very high, the hard ball can't be topped, and it is very difficult for the expert to manage. The logic and subtext of their existence is - tennis is so difficult, know that you can not learn, also know that you do not want to buy expensive, make a cheap to fool you, you play twice, will not play again, so this racket is cheap, you do not feel pain. When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, that you progress, then come back to me to buy the expensive, I earn money twice. It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better racket, choose prince, or Dunlop's, these two brands are not famous enough, so good racket also can not sell on the price, new racket 500, 600 is very good, second-hand 200, have a thousand dollars racket enjoyment does not smell? It is quite friendly to newcomers, but once the novice stage is chicken, but most people, especially girls, can not pass the novice stage.

What is the hottest thing in 2021? It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics. Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards? Some time ago there was an article "Look! Project managers can impact the gold medal Olympic projects" article is very hot, which mentioned that project managers in many projects, absolutely can be the first, no one can match: brick, travel, stay up late is the daily life of project managers, fire-fighting, take the blame, and apologize is not to mention. A seemingly joking and flirtatious article, but also speaks to the daily hardships of project managers, behind the representative of the current project management work is not able to. The people engaged in project management work, but also gradually choose through some actions to get themselves out of the dilemma in the work. From the rising number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) enrollment every year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management capabilities. According to the "China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® applicants nationwide is nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® certified people is about 420,000, and the number of effective holders is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide. In the past 10 years, the number of PMP® holders has been increasing year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the old "experience" to do things, and the rapidly changing work environment makes us know that we have to learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward. However, the PMP exam can guarantee the project management work unimpeded? Many project management beginners say that by studying PMP

As NFT is flaming out of the ring, a new concept has emerged in the crypto community. 2021 saw a blockchain game called Axie Infinity make a huge impact in Southeast Asia, where some residents who had lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income in this game. Axie Infinity is a pet raising game with blockchain technology as the underlying layer, which collects a variety of gameplay methods including NFT and is currently the highest traded NFT project with over $3 billion as of now. On August 6 of this year, Axie Infinity officially said its daily users have exceeded 1 million. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single player, but can participate in the governance of the game ecosystem, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game. This subjectivity is not granted by the game maker, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology. Seeing a news about the share price of friends, my biggest feeling is the choice of the enterprise in the track, which means the choice of the underlying industry of investment, firstly, to choose the industry with large growth space, at least 100 billion market size; secondly, to choose the industry with good future growth, consider the industry with the best state of industry growth after the next 3-5 years; finally, to choose the industry with policy support. How wide the track refers to the market size, how long the track refers to the development stage of the industry, the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry. Cheer for the right track! The first thing to do in the new year is to take stock of 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022. Tactics is to "do the things right", that is to do the things right. And strategy is to "do the right thing", that is, to do the right thing. Strategy is to find the direction, tactics is to implement, in most tactical thinking above, there is room for strategic thinking. For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend in the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right activity KPI to achieve On top of improving campaign engagement (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right campaign KPIs to achieve the right campaign goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and pulling in new customers with precision; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable. Twelve years in the making, Bitcoin saw several milestones in 2021. on September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, the first time Bitcoin became legal tender in a country or region. on October 12, the SEC approved the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares for the first time in eight years and its listing on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF to land in the U.S. capital markets and another expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure.
