In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a house intermediary that a factory building in Zhenting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province. After watching the house on the spot, Mr. Lu decided to buy the plant. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, the family members of the owner of the house, and the house owner's family member Lin made a final deposit of 200,000 yuan on the same day. Lin signed as the payee in the "Power Building of Factory Building Trading", which stated that "if the buyer does not want to buy this plant, this deposit is returned to the seller. It is agreed that the signing and selling contract of the factory building will be signed within a week. "However, after that, the two parties failed to form a consistent opinion due to the fact that the main contracts such as the sale of the plant and the payment method, which caused the house sales contract to be delayed. Considering that the two parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu. The house that was hard to see, the deposit was paid, and the house was ready. The "Linking door" signed the contract, but the seller did not sell it. This made Mr. Lu helpless and angry. To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao People's Court. According to the trial, the two sides failed to sign a formal contract and could not only be attributed to the defendant. They should be reasonably preserved as a negotiation. Therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied to the case. After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the court of the second instance maintained the original sentence. [Lawyer Reminder] During the transaction, we must do our best to pay attention to the obligations of cautious attention. When signing the contract, as a buyer, you must fulfill your cautious attention obligations. For example, to verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by the house, and the specific time and place of the delivery in the contract to prevent fulfilling the contract to prevent the contract from fulfilling the contract to prevent the contract from fulfilling the contract At that time, the two sides were controversial.
Your name is Zheng Mian, this is the second week you moved to Japan. You walked on the street and suddenly found that someone followed you. You scared and faster and faster, and finally ran. The man chased behind you: "Miss! Please wait!" (Talk to Japanese) You stopped at the door of the convenience store. "Miss ... I am a director. I think you look beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?" You are puzzled, fearing that this is a scam. He stuffed you a business card, and you find that he is really the director of a large entertainment company in Japan. "If the lady has time, we can go to the company to talk about it, and the pay must be indispensable." You came to the company with a mess. He said that he saw you on the street at a glance, and he hoped that you could come to participate. If you think that there is no loss, you can make money, and you sign the contract. This is a large -scale love reality show, divided into two parts. In the early stage, celebrities and amateur will get along in real life and cultivate tacit understanding. In the later period, you will enter the game together. It will be officially recorded next week. You do n’t know who your partner will be, and what interesting things will happen?
Let's talk about the conclusion first. I personally think that "Four Seas" is a comprehensive rotten movie, which is in various senses. But you have to say whether this movie is not a highlight, and it is not at least good. There are many kinds of bad movies, so that you can fall asleep in the cinema, so that you can fill it up after watching it. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience. Methods to ignite your anger. In insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented. The most painful thing in this film is that it seems to be a creature in the novels. It is difficult to famous. There are many vulnerabilities like a trench coat on Xiaoma. After reading it, you will doubt whether there is a metaphor that the director is implied, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it is actually a shit. Let me simply talk about some of the plots that I have difficulty in understanding. The place of the male lead should be on a small island on the south, depending on his grandma. Her grandma had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged a uncle in the neighborhood to drive her small van to send her to the northeast to see the snow. Elderly people sitting from the south to the northeast of the elderly? Intersection He and his father were still very assured of this. Then the old man was not following. Opening a hotel on the abandoned ship, how did the hostess get the business license? Why can the speeding party on the island be easily sealed by a section of mountain roads? Intersection Then the truck with a reinforcement in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even a truck driver could not be found around. This item is too obvious. Why does a small mixed Speed Party who is not suspected of credit reporting and suspected of being illegal? Why not call the police in the face of usury, the police in the movie also asked if there was any difficulty? An adult knows how to use smartphones, but does not know how to open the door with a room card in the hotel, and then forcibly arrange to find the hotel owner and sit outside the room door to sleep? This inexplicable plot is filled with the entire film, because the plot is too outrageous that I will feel pain when I remember them. In addition to the plot, the worse thing is the main purpose of the movie, or that the movie has no theme at all, it is an abominable suture monster. At the beginning of the film, you will think he wants to make a comedy film. After more than 20 minutes, you guess it may be a inspirational film. When you watch half of it, you think it may be a plot movie that wants to reflect that the youth of the town is not easy. I don't know what I watched, followed by deep doubts about myself, why do I go to the cinema to enjoy the stool. For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle, you are inspirational + comedy and tell the audience how a talented rookie is successful step by step. If you want to make a love movie, then you honestly talk about the grievances between young people who like to ride motorcycles and waiter girls. If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot appear something contrary to the normal world. (For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zhengyan was just burned, and then the role of singing), you can't open some brains that can't even see Kennedy. As for the heroine's obviously not mentally handicapped, it can perform like a 5 -year -old child in some ways. I really don't know if this is the reason for acting or the director's request. One more thing I don't want to understand, why is Han Han who is so keen to add a collision plot in his own movie as a racer? Such a movie is arranged in the Spring Festival. Is it to add to the audience?
I accidentally saw the following article. From the perspective of business and the perspective of the preservation period, why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help can be canned. This text may explain why customers want to do this? I go to many manufacturers of milk powder and come into contact with many milk powder production lines. In fact, bags are exactly the same as that of listening milk powder. There is no difference. Then everyone will definitely ask: Why is the shelf life of the bag in one year, and the shelf life of listening is two years or longer? Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bags? In fact, many consumers, or mothers think that this is because the raw materials are different, it will be much better. In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks it is good. There are also consumers who have eaten this mentality and reacted and said that the taste or taste of listening to pretend is different! Now I will tell you the reason why you listen to your expensive. Where is the expensive? Why are their raw materials the same difference? Because most of the manufacturers take into account that if the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept it, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit. So what does the manufacturer depend on to survive? Therefore, in the pricing of hearing, they have a large rise to ensure their profit margins. Therefore, most manufacturers push listening, not bags. And you think so many manufacturers have tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of advertising costs each year. Why does this cost come? Everyone can imagine. So with the development of society, the market promotion costs, such as the promoters of the mall, the display costs of the mall, the cost of the product, and the advertising costs, etc., are also increasing. Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly increasing new products, and they are listening, and their prices are constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product that increases with market costs. The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the increase in their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan. There are also some brands. In order to promote their own products, they do not choose to link with the hospital doctors. They assist the promotion of the product and draw profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan. The relevant laws in China are absolutely not allowed to be allowed to operate and methods. In fact, this approach is to harm consumers. It is recommended that you buy a bag of milk powder into the can under the premise that you have a can at home. This can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder without any impact on children. There are also everyone don't think that the shelf life of listening is longer than the bag. If the shelf life of listening to the bag after the bag is opened, it is just that the bag is not easy to save after the bag is opened, and it is easy to be metamorphic.
I just saw an article writing a holiday, which was too long. Let's give me a science. Most girls suddenly go through the first holiday one day during the age of 13-15, at the age of 50. After that, your health will be more regularly every month. However, it is not a regular prediction. About a week or so, you need to prepare in advance, and sometimes you will turn over the car (suddenly a few days in advance). The time length, blood volume, and dysmenorrhea varies from person to person. Change, it did not hurt before it did not mean that it would not hurt for a lifetime. The menstruation cannot be controlled. Bleeding 24 hours a few days before the end of the end. All you can do is to use a sanitary napkin or sanitary cotton bar to prevent flowing on the clothes and chairs. The dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandin. It has not been time to eat ibuprofen when the physiological period has just started to effectively relieve the pain in the month. Before the physiological period, due to uterine congestion and prostaglandin excessive release, diarrhea is easy to be pulled. If it comes to the cycle, inexplicably diarrhea, menstruation will basically come in two days. The best sanitary napkin is best replaced every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria and remove the sleep time. The worst situation is to change 6 times a day, 7 days per month, that is 42 tablets. The film is not used every month. (Modify here, you don't need to change the cotton bars often, you can change it every five or six hours, the longest eight hours. Unlucky, the body stumbling for himself. However, the official crime rate data can see that women's ability to control emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses to use emotional problems. The flow is not just blood, which contains the endometrium of the descendant. After the end of the menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly becomes thicker. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Building a house (thicker endometrium) every month is ready to welcome the guests. Build a new house in a month, and start weekly. Menstruation is very inconvenient. For decades in a row, bleeding for 24 hours a few days a month, with abdominal pain and back pain. Who wants? However, people can be born because his mother has come to menstruation. The menstruation is to prepare a house for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone wants to thank their mothers to the regular menstruation. In the past, many things of women were suppressed. The society was dirty and shameful for women. Everyone thought it was like that, but the times changed. If some people think that menstruation is disgusting and feels nauseous to prepare for women's bodies for breeding of life. It should not be said in the general court. Girls stand up, don’t think so, never experienced it. Men who do n’t know much about it, do n’t have to be so unforgettable, do n’t know how to do it, how do you feel embarrassed to face his mother, how do you think about your children? Finally, the sisters try the sanitary cotton bar, which is really easy to use.
Metaphysics refers to the question that cannot be directly answered through sensory reasoning and logic that cannot be directly perceived. Metaphysics is the basic rule of philosophy, which aims to explain the basic nature of existence and the world. The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" is taken from the word "metaphysics, and the metaphysical device" is "metaphysical", which is translated by Metaphysic in Metaphysic. The metaphysical branch includes ontology, natural theology, and its extension issues. The theory of ontology is "studying which nouns represent the real entity, and which nouns are just a concept." Naturalism in school refers to denying God's existence. Its theoretical basis believes that all phenomena can be explained in the concept of natural reasons, and it is proposed by philosophers who support science and evolution. And method naturalism refers to the research method that does not say the word of God. Psychiatric philosophy is a philosophical branch of the essence of research consciousness and the nature of the relationship between the body (especially the brain). The theory of dualism and one -the -ware theory is the most important idea of the "relationship between the soul and the flesh". Activeness is a philosophical branch of the nature, origin and scope of knowledge. Ethics is a discipline of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, morality is defined as a group of people or a cultural recognition of all behavior criteria. It is mainly divided into meta ethics (abstract the essence of ethical theory or criticism), standardize ethics (judge various moral outlooks, and give moral guidelines for correct or wrong behaviors. Moral behavior), application ethics (academic academics that apply ethical theory to actual living conditions, including biological ethics, political ethics, etc.), describe ethics (collect information about how people live, from observed styles to make Summary. Its interviews with ethics are not based on expected theories, but the real choice made by investigating the actual moral subject and observed, which has contributed to all the moral factors of this decision. It discusses the social ethnic group The ethical concept held). The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics. The first part: the ethical thoughts of humanism are represented by Walla and Mengtian. Part 2: The ethical thoughts of religious reform are represented by Calvin. Part III: Political Ethics, represented by Makia Veli and others, modern ethics (17-18 century, British empiricist ethics, representative: Hume, etc., 17-18 century, European rationalist ethics, representing representatives, representing representatives Characters: Spearosa et al. In the 18th century, French Enlightenment Ethics, representative: Voltaire, etc., 18-19 century, German college ethics, representative figures: Kant and Hegel, etc. , British utilitarian ethics, representative characters: Bian Qin and Westvir, etc., 19th century, Ethics of British evolution, representatives: Spencer and Huxley, etc., in the late 19th century, Germany's neo -ethical ethics, Representative: Li Kaier, etc., in the late 19th century, New Hegelist Ethics, representatives: Thomas Hill Green, etc.), Ethics (irrationalist ethics, representative figures: Kerkai Guo'er, representative of the transition period: Schopen Hua and Nietzsche). Logic is a discipline that studies the "principles and standards of effective inferences and proofs". Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, retrospective reasoning and interpretation reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic. Aesthetics is a subject with the theme of the essence of beauty and its significance.
Ding Zilin: To friends. I sincerely thank your friends for the humanitarian assistance given by our relatives for more than 30 years after the death of our loved ones. Especially in early 1994, I had sent an excessive humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994. Rescue. Nowadays, most of the elderly parents of the victims have thanked the world, and the orphans have grown up to employment. It is your righteousness to help us have the most difficult moments. At present, the new crown epidemic is raging globally, and most donors have also retired every year. Therefore, I earnestly asked you to stop giving us difficulty -Tiananmen Mother's group humanitarian donation, this humanitarian rescue activity should have been perfectly ended. I will always remember your love and believe that your righteousness will be remembered for history. For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, and please forgive me! Please accept my sincere blessings. Ceramics: Please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32 -year history of humanitarian assistance for the Humanitarian rescue of the National Foundation (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democratic Foundation (MCDF). 在从事人道主义救助的过程中，全美学自联与明尼苏达中国民主基金会是平行的两个组织，项目的执行者常有交叉。（苹果日报图：天安門母親網站由陶業負責打理。）pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm救助款常常不能顺利送达六四难属手中。1994年，经丁老师建议，由“天安门母亲”成立专门小组，统筹和负责人道救助款的接收与分发。1998年，MCDF设立《六四孤儿教育基金》，执行11年后，于2009年，在所有六四孤儿都大学毕业后，MCDF继而设立《六四孤苦老人特困户救助基金》，并一直执行至今。这些项目的资金，主要来自六四当年的校园和社会捐款，来自个人的慷慨捐助，并受到兄弟大学民主基金会的支持。自2018年起，还得到了劳改研究基金会的支持。直到去年，时隔31年后，六四难属们终于收到了一笔来自香港的当年以六四的名义募捐来的部分捐款。在此期间，《中国人权》也在独立地执行它们的人道救助项目。我们理解，丁老师叫停六四捐助，是为捐款人考虑，我们也确实都是一些退休老人，收入并非如退休前充裕，特此对丁老师的“致友人”一信表示感谢。 We will respect the decisions of the difficulties, terminate this project within two years, and immediately recover. For those colleagues who have been generous and risky, they have expressed their gratitude and respect.
A programming Xiaobai who wants to share personal experience. If you plan to enter the industry in this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you do n’t have this idea, it is best to learn it yourself. After all, the training needs to be spent. Learn for a month. But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially those who have self -control and weakness, training is a very good choice. If you have a strong self -control, you can choose to learn by yourself, but it will be tired. Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First of all, it depends on the teacher's teacher's teacher. If the teacher's power is not strong enough, this training institution will not make much sense. Of course, some new training institutions are not particularly strong. Secondly, after choosing, you can inquire about this training institution. It is best to inquire students from this institution. After all, only the institutional students know how this institution is, and the courses explained are good or bad. Hello, in fact, I do n’t know how to answer this question, because I do n’t do a certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with the individual's own situation. For example, professional, age, language, and even in any city, these will have something to do with the industry you learn or want to engage in. If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you have graduated from computer majors, if time is sufficient, I personally recommend self -study. This is the lowest efficiency and cost. Now many offline training institutions are actually very good. , But the cost of learning is high, and the second investment time is more. Basically, we need to be trained for 3-6 months. But if I said these situations, it is very convenient to study. Many of the learning resources on the Internet now are free, or there are many training resources when you go to station B. If you don’t find resources, you can also contact by brief introduction. To me, get free resources, or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning. If you are not a computer professional, but you can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to study institutions to learn. This is not very laborious to learn. The teacher explains very detailed. Or it is also helpful in supervision. In addition, many training institutions will sign an employment agreement, and there are internal pushing places. After studying, it is recommended to go to the company. In this way, the interview link to find a job later can save a lot of things. The above is some of my views. Because I do n’t understand your situation, I ’m probably not detailed. If you have other people who want to consult, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
I take all kinds of (installation, cleaning, repair, maintenance), wall -mounted boiler water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stove heads, pyrrolas, lamps, wiping glass, professional sewing, housekeeping service, thank you for giving me some some time The praise, the life is tired for hard work for life, but if you continue to live, you will not live up to everyone. If you like it, pay attention to me. Thank you for your life for me. Others only look at the results. In the face of life, in the face of life, in addition to being strong, we are continuing. There is no choice. The road can look back but cannot go back ... Cleaning is a job, a duty, life is beautiful because of service, and the service is wonderful due to intention. Although we do the dirtiest work, we will use the most serious attitude to clean each corner of the customer's house. Seeing the customer's satisfactory smile and the erected thumbs. It's worth it, there is a reward in the end! My daily work -your request, my service. Serve it carefully, clean it with heart, and keep beauty. The details you care about, Feng Guizheng helped you to "net" and serve the love home. Bao Wanjia is clean, the family is a monument, the service is in place, and the home is clean. Cleaning indoor and outdoor, although my daily work crystal lamp is gorgeous, but it will be dim after a long time without cleaning. Only after cleaning can we overflow the light. Life is so careful to make it successful. We are seriously beautiful. Give me a chance, it will definitely make you satisfied, the quality explain everything, because the profession is worthy of being trusted, your recognition is my most encouragement! The current industry is not easy to do! But I always believe that as long as I take a serious attitude, I persist, and work hard, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining "! The plan of the day is in the morning, all the beauty starts in the morning and hope that you will bring happiness with happiness from early morning. , Lucky, Healthy, Ruyi Starting a new day, maintaining a good mood for a whole day, good morning, happiness is a thing, and happiness is happy; when you grow up, happiness is a goal, and you will be happy; after maturity, you find that Happiness is a mentality. If you understand, you can be happy. Be the most authentic and kind self, do not regret this life; one way in life, take your own way; two treasures of life: good health, good mood, beautiful bleeding Life is old! Every stage of life will encounter different problems. Many times, it is not ability, but the courage to be actively facing. Since you can't avoid it, it is better to face it calmly. The more scared you, the more difficult it will be knocked down; if you face the difficulties, the problem will eventually be solved.
Second, although the right school has a long time in history, it is not long, so the short is because it is brilliant to give a little sunlight. But in terms of facts, rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress. The positive significance of the right should not deny the positive significance of the right of the right from ending the standard of the truth of the definition of the Cultural Revolution and the development of the economy and the promotion of administrative institutionalization and human rights guarantee. Third, as far as I am concerned, although I do n’t fully agree with Li Weidong's claims, I care about his statement and respect Li Weidong. Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also a social issue in China. Look carefully. But I oppose his anti -communist theory. I think that anti -revolutionary revolution, the revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, the people's livelihood is damaged, and the political groups are mixed with mud. Fourth, change or improve China's patience and be responsible for the country and the people. Political speculative attempts to take the shudder in the fire. That is not the right, but a bastard. Talk to the left. Left is actually a group of times and politics abandoned. If the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right words and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not be made, because the left is the dross thrown by the Communist Party! 5. Recently, I saw some friends who were fighting against the thieves and refuted left epilepsy. Do not try to reason with traitors and Zuo Eppyolics. They are all tendons, unreasonable. Don't try to prove that we are right, let alone let the anti -thief and left epilepsy admit, why bother? I told my friends like this: When the anti -thief scolds you five hairs, when the left epilepsy scolds your right dog, it just proves that our intermediate road is correct! Many people also have ideals when they were young. When they were old, they forgot their ideals or pursuing ideals, but they became paranoid. The ideal is drifting away, and even the Dragon Tuzu teenager eventually became a evil dragon. I think it generally refers to restraint and freedom. China ’s congenital genes from historical and culture have caused China as a whole. The domestic right is free, focusing on efficiency and development, strengthening supervision, and paying more attention to fairness and safety. At present, society hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, it is certain that China and the United States are struggling. It is estimated that it has to last for many years. Although I don’t understand, just do nothing if you like it.
In the past two years, the United States' blockade and enclosure of Huawei chips not only caused Huawei to fall into unprecedented difficulties, but also caused huge losses for "American" companies. The US emperor suppressed the Chinese chip industry and demanded that its own enterprises and allies related enterprises to block the chip industry in my country at the same time. The direct result is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a decrease in research and development investment in chip production enterprises, decreased production capacity , Resulting in the disorder of the shortage of chip supply chains worldwide. Today, the "lack of cores" has affected major industries in the world, such as car companies to stop production and increase their mobile phones. Almost all industries used in chips are deeply harmed. In order to grasp the autonomy of "chip", more and more national science and technology giants have begun to move towards the path of "de -beautification". In order to firmly control the control of global semiconductor and restrain the development of the Chinese semiconductor industry, Lao and the United States have recently been frequent, and they are also hosting the "Chip Summit". For example, in order to regain the dominant position of the chip field, Intel, the old -fashioned technology giant in the United States, spent 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened a chip foundry business to the outside world. When most people think that Intel's move this time will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to snatch TSMC's "rice bowl". The reason why it is so affirmation is that, as an old -fashioned technology giant in the United States, Intel has cultivated in the semiconductor field for decades. With a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, it will definitely rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC. However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou disdain. At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou was amazing. Zhang Zhongmou was not upright for Intel to spend the WAilin Factory: Intel built a chip foundry factory, it was quite ironic. The reason why Zhang Zhongmou was disdainful to Intel's march to enter the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou was still worried about a period of grievance between TSE and Intel more than 30 years ago. In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has always been the pearl of the US Emperor's manufacturing industry. It ranks at the top of the world and is the hegemon of the world's semiconductor field. By the 1980s, world semiconductor high -end chips had been controlled by a few strong men. At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM mode. The chip was completed from design, manufacturing to sealing and testing. Intel was the representative of that era. However, such models make some small companies overwhelmed, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face huge amount of production line construction costs. Under the call of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to have a phenomenon of division of labor cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design. Factory made in wafer. Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and TSMC came into being. TSMC aimed at the single link of "wafer processing" for its main business. It did not design, and only provided foundry services for wafer manufacturing. At that time, TSMC, which was just founded, was a little bitter in front of the Giant Intel. In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou had invested in Intel, but at that time, Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing process of the chip industry, it was obviously a bit high, and he looked down on TSMC and decisively refused to invest in TSMC. Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel was looking down on wafer -based services at the time. Unexpectedly, the giants of the wafer manufacturing service that year, but now they have to start working as a wafer foundry. Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt ironic that Intel entered the wafer foundry. Today, the market value of TSMC has exceeded Intel. Faced with the strong offensive of TSMC, Intel naturally did not dare to stop himself. Today, TSMC has sprinted towards the 3nm chip, and Intel still stays at 14nm 7 years ago. It's not easy to catch up.
Look at some [Strange Search] today. What is normal public opinion? Randomly select three hot search: February Erlong's head up, beautiful friends increased prices, and cargo pull incidents, public opinion spread to form a peak, and then [exponential decrease] (smooth curve) finally dissipated. Essence They seem to be different from the [Internet Public Opinion evolution model] showed by the official website of the Internet Information Office. What is abnormal public opinion? Randomly select the six hot search in the same incident, showing [Lonely Peak], [Saw tooth], [Cliff -shaped]. [Lonely Peak] means that people are heating and quickly searched for the list, causing the public's attention; [Saw tooth], that is, periodic heating to ensure the topic of the topic entangled in the hot search list; "Function", receiving new tasks and rushing towards the new battlefield. In Figure 9, the hot peak of one incident is exactly the valley of the other incident. The time is not bad. It must be a unified group of water forces to receive the task and start a new round of offensive. The professionalism of the black public relations is evident: dozens of hot search are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which is responsible for science, which cites, which shifts, which affect cognition, which misleading judgments, which incite emotions, which are stubborn decision -making decisions Black -producing accounts are in batches and sub -nodes refined combat, and almost take into account all elements in the spread of public opinion. Communication is a science, aside from all subjective factors and emotions, and only from objective data, the Black Public Relations will have nowhere to hide. Whenever we must leave traces, we dug out such traces. Data source: hot search time machine.
What are the differences in market positioning laser TV and traditional TV? From my understanding, the traditional TV that the subject said should refer to LCD TVs, and the differences between market positioning of laser TV and LCD TVs mainly include the following two points: First, laser TV focuses on the large screen market. Compared with the full market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TV obviously focuses on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of large screens. At present, the size of the mainstream LCD TV is mostly 55 -inch to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally above 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, which fully meets users' needs for large screen color TVs. In recent years, the global shipments and sales of laser TV have been increasing, accounting for more than 60 % of the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above. According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales of the laser TV market will grow more than 140%, which will continue to maintain a high -speed growth. The reason why there are such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection. Based on the imaging principle of laser TV's mansion, the light emitted by the laser light source does not shoot directly into the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation of the eyes is also smaller. The China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute Saixi Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital Ophthalmology experts, through the same conditions of the crowd to watch the strict comparative test of laser TV and LCD TVs, obtained 144 groups of test data. Data confirmed that laser TVs do have strong eye protection characteristics, and even have a certain improvement in specific aspects. At the moment when vision health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracted more and more users with the advantages of eye protection, but also opened another breakthrough in the color TV market. Second, laser TV focuses on high -end markets. In contrast to the price of LCD TVs, the current price of commercial laser TVs is mostly more than 10,000 yuan. As the size and light source are upgraded, the price has gradually risen. Why does laser TV sell so expensive? It must be reasonable. Under the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser TVs have many advantages that can not be achieved by LCD TVs and projection. With ultra -short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than traditional projection equipment. It can achieve a 100 -inch large -screen experience within a short distance. The required space is not large, and the host is small and the place occupies a small place. In terms of brightness, large brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000. In addition, the heat is lower, the device is small, and the service life of the TV is longer. In addition, many high -end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting -edge technologies such as real 4K ultra -high -definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, and bionic screen, which can bring more shocking audiovisual experiences to users. Do not talk about pseudo -demand, but the product of demand segmentation. On the quality of picture quality and input and output. Laser TV is not a dish for audiovisual players. If you want to take into account the large screen and the environment, you can try it. You can try it. If you can judge yourself, you are afraid of listening to the words. To put it simply, ultra-wide-angle near-focus projector-laser TV, in order to get closer to the curtain, has to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lens and reflectors, which is not in line with optical best design. In order to shield some environmental light, the micro -structured Fresnel curtain is costly, and the price of 80 -inch can basically change a 65 -inch LCD. Another point, I particularly hate the projection manufacturer's reflection on the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the curtain that can be seen by the eyes is to the eyes of the eyes. In this way, it is necessary to "direct" the LCD TV. Isn't it also illuminated on the TV ceiling? Moreover, if the projection curtain is not reflected, it will not be like it. It is just ignored the heat spots (light spots) effect of high -gain curtains. A large amount of light reflects the eyes at a certain angle is really uncomfortable.
Is it reliable to buy insurance? Little umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform. From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokers (Revised in 2015)", those who become insurance brokerage companies must meet three keywords: shareholders and sponsor have no major illegal records in the past three years, minimum limits of the lowest limit, minimum limit, It can be established for RMB 50 million and must be consent of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. These three items are actually very harsh. To sum up, it is necessary to have strength. The insured does not have to question whether the small umbrella insurance is regular or not. After all, there are three thresholds, not any insurance company can reach. At this point, it is not bad, it is trustworthy. From the perspective of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket. Many companies 'stars' critical illness insurance is sold on this platform. For Heeta Life, Little Umbrella Insurance is just a third -party agency, without questioning its reliability. From the perspective of the payment model: the product of the Internet platform, because the operating expenses of the business outlets and the cost of the salary of the salesperson, the general cost -effectiveness of Internet products is relatively high, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the pressure of the insurer's payment pressure At the same time, you can pry the leverage of insurance to the greatest extent. This is still very good. Can consider it. Judging from the professionalism of the salesperson: This is particularly important, because insurance is an industry with a very strong professional requirement. Many Internet product customers can insure themselves. This will have a lot of misunderstandings. Non -insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when they are insured, and feel that they are healthy or consistent. This is easy to have many hidden dangers of claims and may be rejected. I have done insurance telephone sales on the "Tencent Micro Insurance" (like the small umbrella, but also the Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I will tell everyone very responsible. The insurance of the Internet is true and reliable. What is unreliable is people. The Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are many misleading sales. For example: 1 yuan insurance insurance 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, and receive 60,000 serious illness insurance amounts for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are lightly avoided, and they will not tell the insured. The charges ranged from tens to 200, and many customers deducted for a year or two to buy them. It is unclear. I thought it could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company compensated 6 million (piers in the world). Free mobile phone, which is only sent by the special insurance order number such as 66666,8888, and if the text message is sent, it will not be redeemed, and no one reminds it. (This is another pit for the insurer.) It is a short -term for a short period of time. It is a short -term. If you only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance. What if you really have serious illness? No problem, the future life began to break naked. At present, the country is also severely cracking down on Internet insurance sales. Therefore, comprehensive point of view, the platform is no problem, and there is no problem with the product. What is the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson. It is recommended that the main topics consider carefully. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider product, more opportunities and products that customers can choose, and some products are more cost -effective than Internet products. I have helped 59 Internet customers, offline products, and premiums for each person to save 2000-3000 yuan/year. If you have any questions, please communicate and communicate with me. Me: Mingya Insurance Agent, with 3 years of corporate management training experience, serving nearly a thousand enterprise users, and more than 100 insurance companies in cooperation. Before the insurance, I will start from customer needs to tailor insurance products for customers. During the insurance, the customer is compared with three, and try to strive for the best underwriting results for customers. After the insurance is insured, the insurance policies are organized, and the policy custody will be kept at ease. Growing up with each customer for life. I hope my answer can help the subject! According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is the insurance business that can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking the insurance link. In the process, the insured does not need to sign, and the insurance consultant does not need to sign. All steps can be completed by the insured. Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have a sense of "ritual", and may even have no printed paper contract, this does not affect the effectiveness and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract. This model is a bit similar to the "telephone sales" general assembly line operation, but there will be a fatal problem when buying insurance, that is, the subsequent service may not keep up. Insurance is usually a long -term contract for decades. When we buy insurance, should we think carefully? Is this "intermediary" we chose? Will the "insurance intermediary" provide us?
From the past to the present, I have opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I can't accept such personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but to prevent this villain. If you don't look at political parties and factions, you must resist first, this is this uncivilized style. Starting from you to send a Facebook plus a friend's request, and then publish a ridiculous post, and then you try to publish the so -called home location and your father's name on social media. After you passed away, he worsened not only to continue tag at the frequency of six meals a day, but also discussed with your so -called friends on Facebook with your so -called friends. Makes strawberries on the bed, or not to insert a message, I ... forget it. How did I later receive a number of friends who have received a lot of friends on Facebook friends to upload a photo of your photos and sexual harassment ingredients. Sorry, as a girl, I can no longer continue to silence. After the news of my alarm, you did not converge at all, but became more and more arrogant. I ignore what political background you are, and no matter what status you are, in our society, you need to respect both sex. Yes, you can continue this kind of ridicule, vague, humiliating, and abusive remarks, you can continue to say that you just care and follow me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can continue to deny that it is not your system. The diagram or continue to make all aggressive remarks. That's right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you. I do n’t know you nor want to know you, my appearance and figure do n’t need you to comment. I don't even think there will be any girl who is willing to make others so humiliate to be famous. My friend asked me, is it okay? I said yes, you won't believe it either. I don't think any girl can be said to be okay after being so bully. Whether in work, society, politics or business circles, only those who do not even have basic morals will choose to use this method to hurt any woman. I believe that justice and comfort. I cut some messages to give you the post you posted your own posts. No one can pretend to be you. I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization and smile
U.S.-American aircraft carrier gathers the most powerful weapons around China. It is rare to visit Guam 2022-01-17 Multi-dimensional media multi-dimensional reports: The latest news of Sino-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three American aircraft carriers are gathered around China; the US media also disclosed that the US media also disclosed that One of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy weapon library is rare to visit Guam and releases important signals to the United States and opponents in the Indo -Pacific region. According to the China Think Tank's "South China Sea Strategic Situation Performance Platform", on January 9, satellites discovered the US Army "USS Carl Vinson" near the Barabak Strait. The Barabak Strait connects the South China Sea and Sulu Sea, which is the strategic place on the first island chain of the West Pacific. The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed in the South China Sea. This is the first time that the "Karl Vinson" aircraft carrier has been equipped with a F-35C fighter and CMV-22 carrier-based transport aircraft for deployment. In addition to the "Carl Vinson", the U.S. aircraft carrier, which is now on the Pacific Ocean, is also the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier departing from the United States on January 3. The "Lincoln" is also equipped with the F-35C carrier-based aircraft for the first time, which is a 314 fighter attack squadron of the US Marine Corps. In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia -Pacific region. There are also "Uss Ronald Reagan" aircraft carrier, which is in the Asia -Pacific region. The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Lake of the Shangpuland" missile cruiser and the "Stockdar" missile destroyer.

Talking to friends about Meta recently plummeted 26%, and the market value evaporated at $ 251 billion. Zuckerberg responded to "facing unprecedented competition." Why? Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, which mainly comes from advertising. Today, advertising companies that make money today have traffic channels. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. No matter what functional positioning, it is Meta's traffic channel. Not only that, META is still the biggest "advertising alliance", many APPs are connected to META advertisements, and the advertising platform of META is realized. But the times have changed. First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get the user's data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising. Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it will obviously indicate whether users allow the APP to obtain their own information. Most people's normal reactions are definitely not allowed. Next, if Google has another knife, the impact of Meta's income will be even greater. Second, the Chinese factors in the income growth of META have also weakened (the proportion of this factor is not sure how high it is, but it does exist). Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate. At least 10%of META's income from Meta each year, it is mainly contributed by China's company's company. There are about hundreds of Meta's office in Hong Kong, and there are still several major agents in the mainland. If Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that can't be bypassed. Most of the money burned has given Meta. Interestingly, the TT of bytes now is one of the main competitors of Meta, but the previous two years of Meta can make a lot of money from the byte. Various domestic agents in China are used to advertise in META, and the performance of Meta Greater China is also very good. I have not specially understood recently, but it is definitely not better than before. The stage of Chinese companies in large -scale overseas burning money has passed. Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth. Facebook is getting older, and the new platforms including TT are not in the hands of Meta. The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations. The capital market is not only fancy revenue, but more importantly, it depends on the future expectations. Obviously, Meta's expectations are not enough. In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg tells the "Yuan Universe". The Yuan universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the Yuan universe is relatively long. This story should not be enough in the past two or three years. Support the market value of Meta. So in the next two years, it should be a difficult period for META. Don't look at Facebook's very beautiful scenery now. There are also 100 billion to $ 2,000 billion in income each year. In fact, Facebook is now very crisis. Compared with other Internet companies and high -tech companies, there is no good and safe moat. Although several of his social software is now relatively high, it is also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of TIKTOK, Facebook has no confidence, and the subversion is the blink of an eye. And the concept of being expected to be expected to be in the Yuan universe has no hope of success within a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg is replaced by the company's name, and it is constantly looking for it. The fundamental reason for the new track, but I think his track selection is wrong, and it is some of my thoughts above the way to reference.

I want to try the tennis, but I am afraid that I can't hold on, so I want to find a similar price to practice. Not friendly. In fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendship. If it cannot be distinguished, the normal normal situation will be friendly than cheap slabs. Such "entry shooting" is actually industrial garbage. They are very low. The ball hit the shot, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't stand, and it is difficult for masters to control. The logic and subtext they exist are that the tennis is so difficult. Knowing that you can learn, you are not willing to buy expensive, and make a cheap goods and fool you. If you play twice, you will not play again. This beat is cheap, and you don't feel bad. When you can really distinguish the good or bad, it means that you have improved. When you come to me to buy expensive, I make two money. It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second -hand racket, and choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are enough to be famous, so good rackets can not sell the price. The new shooting 500, 600 is good, second -hand ones are very good. The second -hand ones are very good. 200 yuan to enjoy a thousand yuan shots? It is very friendly to novices, but after the novice stage, it will be chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the novice stage.

What is the hottest in 2021? It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympic Games. Do you think only Olympic athletes can win prizes? Some time ago, there was a "Look at it!" The project manager can impact the gold medal Olympic project. "The article is very hot. It is mentioned that the project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects. No one can: move brick, travel, stay up late is the daily life of the project manager, fire saving, back pot, , Apologize even more. A seemingly joke article also revealed the daily bitterness of the project managers, and behind it is the power of the current project management work. The person who engaged in project management also gradually chose to get rid of the dilemma at work through some actions. From the perspective of the number of applicants for the rising PMP (qualifications for international certified project management professionals), more and more project management practitioners improve their project management capabilities through learning.

About 300,000 people account for 31.2%of the global PMP® permit. In the past 10 years, the number of PMP licenses has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is not advisable to do things by simply copying the previous "old experience". The scientific giant's shoulder goes up to explore the road of moving forward. However, can I ensure that the project management work is unobstructed after passing the PMP? Many beginners of project management said that by studying related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically grasp the top ten areas of project management and five major process groups, but they are still confused when they are truly project management. Many project managers often feedback the following issues: project management cognition is not in place, relying on personal experience simply, empty project management theory, I do not know how to practice; the lack of system management process system support, the project cannot be implemented, the project estimates are not allowed, the project estimates are not allowed. The sensitivity of controlling the control is poor, and the project is dragged again and again; the membership of the membership is unclear, and the "old fritters" in the team do not know how to cope with the unscrupulous communication between the cross -departmental assistance, and the project is difficult to advance ... Therefore, it is difficult for the project to focus on product innovation and research and development management. Carrying has helped many excellent companies to cultivate a large number of key talents such as product managers, project managers, etc., and has won honorary titles such as "Chinese Enterprise R & D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base".

Known as the largest sound of supercars in Johor Bahru! This car brought to everyone this time is the dream of many men! It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, Murcielago's replacement model-Aventador LP700-4! The price is nearly two million, the road tax is more than ten thousand a year, and the four -wheel drive, why is it called LP700? Because of 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast you are? I do n’t know if the editor is not known. The data says that the 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds. It is probably that the Myvi of Xiaobian will only reach 100km/h when it will only be 30km/h. Hmm. The low body, arrogant scissors doors, huge air intakes around the body, and 6.5 V12 engines that have a glance at the glass perfectly interpret Lamborghini's style. There is no need to say too much about the instructions of the model, just google for your own. Xiaobian has compiled some commentary that Google may not give! Too much attention, everyone is watching wherever you go, very uncomfortable! (Actually it is a bit cool) 1km oil money is around RM1 (the owner does not care at all) Practice the posture of getting on and off, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing (because it will not climb out of the cabin and then get half of it) The engine will be too loud, and it will be deaf after getting off the car. (But it's still cool.) The body is too large, and it will be very narrow in the ordinary parking space. I am afraid that it will be knocked when it is opened by the car next door! It's a bit lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (the editor said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha), don't misunderstand, the supercar of this video is not sold, sorry! Friends who want to shoot videos for your car, welcome to contact us! More car information you do n’t know, just the car guide / people ’s car history involves a car accident worth 10 million! Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that riders know it. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also a million level! A few days ago, in just a few minutes, I hit a million sports car 911 and there were ten million super running Chiron! Looking at the results, it makes sense!
When NFT came out quickly, a new concept appeared in the encrypted community. In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their job opportunities for the epidemic began to get a stable income in this game. "Axie Infinity" is a pet -developing game with blockchain technology as the bottom. It gathers a variety of gameplay, including NFT, is currently the highest transaction NFT project. So far, it has exceeded $ 3 billion. Tokensminal data shows that Axie Infinity has a daily income of more than $ 8.2 million, which is directly forced to "Glory of the King". On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily live users had exceeded 1 million. The fieryness of "Axie Infinity" transmits a new "PALYTOEARN" model to more people. Through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single role. In addition You can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
