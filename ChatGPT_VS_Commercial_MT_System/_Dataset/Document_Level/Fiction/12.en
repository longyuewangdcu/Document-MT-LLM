“Suzaku.”  While inside the dainty looking bamboo cabin, Bai Yan was just in the middle of watching her son and Dragony playing out in the front yard when she overheard the commotion: “What’s happening outside, why is there so much noise?”  “Go have a look.” Arching her first, the phoenix woman left as told to investigate only to return not long afterwards. Hesitant in her voice: “Queen, there are two people outside wanting to meet you….” “Looking for me?”  raising a brow, Bai Yan was rather surprised by the answer. “I’ll go out and meet them then.”  Getting up from the chair, Bai Yan casually strolled out of the cabin to find two unexpected people quivering at her entrance. Perhaps it’s the fact that they had climbed up the mountain in such an indignant manner, but those kneecaps had already been ridden with blood, thus leaving a trail behind themselves as well. “What are you two doing?”  Slightly furrowing her brow, Bai Yan snaps at the two men. Pale in the face, Second Elder uncomfortably answers first: “Queen, I am here to atone for my sin. That day I foolishly believed in that imposter’s word and caused the misunderstanding between you and His Majesty, everything is my fault. I am willing to bear any form of punishment you see fit, please punish me.” “No Queen, the fault is mine and not Second elder’s. His Majesty ordered me to bring you word of his departure in order to lift the seal, but I got careless and mishandled the mission. This is all my fault, please punish me instead.” Kneeling there with tears slobbering up his face, Fire Plume held nothing back and pulled one of the bamboo sticks out from his back.  Presenting it before his queen, it’s obvious he wants her to whip him with the damn thing.  But words are words. When the item finally left his hand after Bai Yan picked it up, his body inherently froze over for the impending strike. Yet….  nothing came of it.  There’s no pain or the sound of bamboo hitting his flesh, nor are there any words of scolding or curses, just an uncomfortable silence as he hung his head low. “Did you suffer a lot when crawling up here?” It was Bai Yan who eventually broke the awkward moment with her words. “Qu… Queen?”  Fire Plume looks up in confusion, unsure what to make of that. “In that case then your crimes have been atoned.” Bai Yan has always been a person who holds a clear line on what’s right and wrong, meaning she would only target those whom wishes her harm.  What’s more, does she even have the right to get angry at these two when she herself was fooled into those lies? Of course not! Fire Plume on the other hand was stiff as a rock right now despite the goodwill. This loyal subordinate of Di Cang’s just couldn’t believe he’s going to be let off the hook this easily.  In fact, this bird man has prepared for the worse.  The bare minimum would be a long session of being whipped until their skin was bleeding, or at least lose half their life in the process. Getting annoyed in the face after getting no reaction from the two: “What?”  “Do you want me to help lift you two up or something?” Sure enough, the fierce voice finally knocked them both out of the dazed state. Jerking up in his haste, Fire Plume suddenly found himself unable to steady his legs due to the scrapes he suffered so far.  Even so, he continues to force that shaky leg to remain standing in light of how awkward and funny he appears. If one had to describe his appearance, it would be like a duck squatting around after being tired out. Unable to bear this ridiculous picture, Bai Yan rolls her eyes and points to the stone stools nearby: “Sit over there and rest. Once the both of you are better then go back.”
