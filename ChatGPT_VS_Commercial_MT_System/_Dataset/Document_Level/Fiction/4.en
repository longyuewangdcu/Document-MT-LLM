Yan Rusheng rolled his eyes. “Wen Xuxu, you think too highly of yourself.” “Are you implying that I’m not pretty?”  Wen Xuxu pouted as she frowned at him. Yan Rusheng was momentarily stumped before breaking into a smile. His hand, which was on her waist, traveled to her chest before he pinched her. He bent to glare at her with malice in his eyes. “You… sly and stupid woman.” He hastened his footsteps and walked to the bed. Throwing his gentleness to the wind, he threw Xuxu on the bed. Then he removed his shirt impatiently. After removing his belt and every other clothing on him, he pounced on Xuxu. He was rough and acting on his whims. He gazed into the depths of Xuxu’s eyes and her heartbeat raced rapidly. After all these years, her heart would still pound and race whenever she looked into his eyes. She would always feel bashful and shy. Perhaps she was too familiar with him. Hence she found it embarrassing. It was true that a rabbit shouldn’t eat the grass by its own burrow. And never to target your close ones. He watched as Xuxu’s face turned red, and he was consumed with excitement and a twinge of annoyance. He was excited because of hormones and his surging desires, and yet he was annoyed by how she acted. Although he liked how bashful and shy she was, he didn’t like how reserved and aloof she was. She never took the initiative. “What else do you want to know? I’ll tell you everything. Look at me.”  Yan Rusheng pressed his hands against the sides of Xuxu’s face as he forced her to look into his eyes. Xuxu turned crimson once more, and her eyes flickered back and forth. She said, “Then say it. Did you steal any other love letters?” “Hmmm…”  Yan Rusheng’s face crumpled with concentration. “Other than Zhao Zheng’s love letter and Jiang Zhuoheng’s chocolate and movie tickets, there was one more. Hao Bang, the son of the public security bureau chief, who was one grade above us. He gave you a rainbow-colored candy.” Xuxu was startled. “What? Hao Bang?” The top scorer for Sciences in the college entrance exams? All the students tend to wordplay on his name and coupled with his reputation, everyone addressed him as Awesome. When she first heard of this name, she remembered him instantly. But wasn’t he a nerd? Why would he send her a gift? “Exactly, I hated his name. And whoever gave him that name.”  Yan Rusheng hissed menacingly. “Luckily, I ate the candy. It was filled with food coloring that it stained my entire tongue with all the colors. It’s a rubbish food. And miserly!” Xuxu was speechless. So, according to him, she should be thankful that he ate the candy on her behalf? Xuxu bit back a laugh while feeling annoyed too. Her eyes roved over his face and she jabbed him hard in his forehead. “Yan Rusheng, you’re really atrocious!” He had gotten what he wanted, and yet he was still pretending. This was really his forte. Amused, she probed, “So because of his son, you disliked bureau chief?” She may have posed him a question, but she sounded assertive. Yan Rusheng pressed his lips quietly to admit it. Xuxu accidentally met his eyes once more and her face turned red. She hurriedly averted her gaze. She asked, “How did you manage to do all these? Why wasn’t I aware at all?” She pouted. Her mind raced for other things to say.
