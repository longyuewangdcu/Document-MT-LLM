As a curbstomp ensued, both parties opened fire. The smell of gunpowder filled the air above the sea. The high-velocity magnetic wave gun in Bai Ye’s hands fired again and another plane was destroyed by him. This gun was nothing short of perfect and he was getting hooked. The young kid kept commanding with calm and ease. The First Terrorist Organization’s air force became an impregnable force that attacked and defended whilst they prepared their final round of attack. Nikolai saw how bad things were and could not be any more concerned about his ego and loudly said, “Master, let’s retreat. If we keep this up, we will be utterly decimated.” Louis, a sinister look on his face, clenched his fists tightly as rage emanated from him. While he could try to clearly and sensibly assess the situation, reluctance overcame him.  All his hard work had gone to waste as he was defeated with them within his grasp. Damn it! A murderous intent flashed past his emerald eyes and then sank into silent melancholy. He turned to Nikolai and nodded as he immediately ordered a retreat. Louis focused his gaze at the two of them who drifted above the sea and coldly harrumphed. They were lucky this time, and he would not allow it to slide. “Darling child, they are retreating. Shall we pursue them?” Bai Ye smiled. He took a special liking to this magnetic wave gun and hugged it as though he was hugging his child. He curled his lips into a calm and dangerous smile. The young kid elegantly smiled and halted the attack. There was a deep calm in his eyes as he slowly said, “If we stop the chase and let him die, it would be such a waste. This game of cat and mouse has just begun.” The tables have turned. Louis should really have not and damn not ought to piss him off. He must find somebody to die with Nuo Nuo. While Louis could dictate how and when the game ought to be played… The young kid coldly smiled aggressively. He would call the shots on how and when the game shall end. Bai Ye smiled as he waved his hand handsomely. “Noted, we’ll call off the pursuit. We have the resources to play along with him. For all you know, somebody else will take care of Louis before we take action.” The young kid coldly smiled as he looked in the direction they escaped. “Chu Li, the battle has ended, so there’s no need for support. Let’s immediately RTB.”  Bai Ye ordered his men to return to Rome after ending his call with Chu Li. Black Eagle and company dragged Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya up with immense effort. As they knew that Cheng Anya had a virus on her, they were already prepared from the start. Third Young Master Ye also warned them that he carried a virus in him, so Black Eagle and company also took precautions. Third Young Master Ye lied down and panted. He could not help but kick Miss Cheng. “Dear Anya, you are so heavy and have to lose weight.” His shoulders were a little numb from swimming in the sea for a long time. To consume that much energy from swimming and hang Cheng Anya to swing in this manner took its toll on his elbows. He almost dropped her into the ocean. He felt chilly as he recalled it. Black Eagle and company cheered for their safety and those who had to give towels and pour hot water did what they had to do. With everyone extremely busy, some even mused and asked Third Young Master Ye how life in the past few days had been. On the plane, the men gathered and it was bustling to life with heroism. Cheng Anya took the towel from Black Eagle to dry her hair and then wrap her shivering body. She ignored what he said. She was finally safe. She sneezed and could not help but wrap herself tighter with her towel. Black Eagle broke into a smile and said, “Third master, if madam was any skinnier, you would call her ribs.” “I am about to.”  Third Young Master Ye also dried himself off the seawater. “This is why ribs are so important.” Keeping in line with the adage that ‘silence is golden’, Cheng Anya remained silent. Black Eagle got them two sets of clothes for them to change into. As they were men’s clothes, Cheng Anya looked comical in them. She instead used a blanket and wrapped herself in them. Just as she finished changing her clothes, Black Eagle told her that Ning Ning wanted to speak to her. Cheng Anya excitedly grabbed over the headset. “Darling, Mommy’s here.” “Hi, Mommy, do you miss your darling child?”  The young kid sat on the sofa as he smiled while talking to Cheng Anya. He had not heard from his mommy in a long time. He really missed her voice. “Not the slightest bit.”  Cheng Anya coldly harrumphed and sounded fierce. “You are such a noob to take so long to find Mommy. You deserve a spanking.” As Ning Ning thought about Xu Nuo, he felt tightness in his chest and smiled instead. “Okay, darling me will accept the spanking. Once we are back in Rome, you can spank me however you want. But I really do miss you, Mommy. Mommy, how dare you not dote on me at all? I dislike you.” “I reject that dislike.”  Cheng Anya smiled widely and asked worryingly, “Were you injured?” “Nope, I am perfectly intact, so don’t worry,” Ning Ning smiled and said. “Mommy, the plane is landing. Let’s talk later.” “Okay.” The young kid turned off the communicator and Cheng Anya took a mouthful of warm water to warm herself. While Third Young Master Ye looked on and hoped to have a word or two with his son, the call ended before he could even have a chat with his son. He looked at Cheng Anya with accusing eyes amidst his immense unhappiness. Miss Cheng calmly ignored him while Black Eagle laughed and said, “Third master, the plane is landing soon. You will get to see young master in a moment.” Third Young Master Ye, feeling he had been totally ignored, could not help but pinch Miss Cheng. He said, “That heartless tyke.” “You’re so petty!”  Cheng Anya scolded him in laughter as she passed hot water to him. Third Young Master Ye, holding the cup that Miss Cheng gave him, drank all the remaining hot water. Some alcohol to warm the body up at this moment would be perfect. The planes were about to soon land in a castle. Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven and company were all present. Once they saw that Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya were safe, everybody heaved a sigh of relief. “Third brother, third sister-in-law, you two look absolutely hideous…”  Ye Wei laughed extremely carefreely. “Third brother, I should take a photo of this for memento’s sake.” “You damn lass.”  Third Young Master Ye scolded her in laughter. With Wei Wei, Eleven, and the young kid all safe, he was relieved. How could anything else give the immense amount of relief after all that he had put in? The young kid wanted to hug Cheng Anya, but she ordered him to stop. The young kid then realized that his mommy carried the virus. Black Eagle had mentioned it, and the young kid’s heart slightly sank when he saw his daddy and mommy hold hands. “Daddy, Mommy, you are all… Bai Ye, please quickly check them up.”  The young kid’s first reaction was to look for Bai Ye. As he was a genius doctor, there was nothing he could not cure. “Got it, got it. Don’t worry.”  Bai Ye smiled. “Virus?”  A handsome dude with gold hair and blue eyes blinked. “Dear stupid, isn’t this your strength?” Stupid? Bai Ye flexed his wrists and broke into a dashing and gentle smile. “Jason, wanna try calling me stupid again?” “…F***! What’s wrong with calling you stupid? You are all along stupid, and how dare you call Black J the Iron.”  Jason, who was known for his fiery tongue was also unbelievably handsome, lashed out at them like a gold-mane lion. His sky-blue eyes were as bright as sapphire. When he flew into a rage, he emanated a wave of chilling anger that was akin to a volcano erupting. His domineering streak was clearly visible. To the side, Black J was a Chinese-English mixed-blood male in his twenties who had extremely delicate features. His features had a mysteriousness Orientals had, and also had the deepness the Westerners had. He had a pair of gray-blue eyes that seemed slightly blurry and gave people the wrong impression of him being deeply passionate. On closer observation, he was extremely keen and had deeply concealed introversion. The two leaders of the First Terrorist Organization were not old and had interesting personalities. Their aura was so strong, as though they ruled over the world. This was despite the three major leaders of the group being present. As one looked at them, visual dissonance stood out. “Jason, you sure need a lesson.”  Eleven coldly harrumphed. “What’s with calling him stupid? Wallop him.” Ye Wei looked at them and shook her head. “Third brother, third sister-in-law, ignore them. Get a hot water shower before the checkup lest you fall sick.” She beckoned the maidservants to bring Ye Chen and Cheng Anya for a shower. While the young kid wanted to follow along, he had to stay here. Just as Bai Ye was about to wallop somebody, the young kid quickly grabbed his collar. “Bai Ye, do you have a way to save my daddy and mommy?” The child’s eyes were like two black grapes embedded in his tender face, extremely bright and filled with hope. Once Bai Ye shook his head, the brightness in his gaze dimmed. Jason, in one fell swoop, swooped the young kid into his embrace and grandly said, “Dear child, relax. Mister Stupid can save even the dead, let alone somebody alive. Why worry then? When you are free, help me level the Mafia’s defenses.” “Who had just doubted Bai Ye’s medical skills?”  Black J expressed his doubts. Jason’s slap came over, and he deftly avoided it. The young kid, who was being hugged by a tall guy, felt extremely conflicted. He kicked Jason and said, “Let me down.” “Damn it, I want such a son too. Ning Ning, would you want to be my son? Gee, I’ve been craving for you for a tad too long,” Jason said as emotions surged in his eyes. It was as though the young kid was like a piece of meat to be savored. Everybody was stunned into silence. Bai Ye smiled and said, “Jason, please have your mommy brush up your mandarin and stop blaming Commander for his poor choice of words. You are… no better off.” “Commander and I are of different leagues, okay?”  Jason was extremely unhappy that people consistently associated him with Commander. This was a problem of principle. Good men and bandits were never family. The young kid struggled and Jason put him down. The young kid asked, “Bai Ye…” “Ning Ning, I can only be certain after I have checked them. Do not panic for now,” Bai Ye said as he gently rubbed his hand on the young kid’s face. “You’ve my promise that I’ll do all that I can.” The young kid had just lost Xu Nuo. Now that his parents’ fate was in the balance, he felt uneasy however calm he was. He could not afford to lose his parents, and Bai Ye clearly understood how he felt. “Don’t worry too much,” Bai Ye said. Ye Wei said, “That should settle it. Once Bai Ye is on the case, there is no problem in the world he cannot solve. If Louis can develop such a virus, there must be an antidote somewhere. If Bai Ye can’t solve that problem, he ought to be stripped of his title.” Chu Li smiled and said, “Agreed.” “Dear stupid, do you have a title?”  Jason asked with some doubt. He had no idea what title Bai Ye had. Eleven wanted to wallop him with a punch. “That said, why didn’t the two of you manage to capture Louis?”  Black J asked. “The earlier this scoundrel dies, the earlier our minds are at ease.” “I’ve long wanted to waste that asswipe. Given how the Mafia has been starting conflicts all around recently, this guy has to be sufficiently terrible to wax and wane when his headquarters has been leveled.” “As for Louis, let’s not hasten,” the young kid slowly said as his face broke into a dangerous smile and a scheming intent showed through his eyes. “To win without fighting is the ideal situation, and our personal vendetta with him another thing. That said, the turf war between the Mafia and terrorists is another thing.  If we want to eliminate the Mafia, we will have to incur a massive financial cost and material burden.  Following his recent engagement with us, his position in the Mafia would be precarious. I’ve long suspected that there is a power center in the Mafia that is hidden from plain sight, which explains why Louis’ suicidal maneuver was halted. Since that is the case, let’s allow Louis to take the lead, fish out this power center, and take them out in one fell swoop.” How scheming indeed… That was everybody’s sentiments. Although he was typically scheming and devious, people would excessively dote on him given his extremely young age. That, added to how tender he looked, often caused people to overlook what he was capable of. “Scheming!”  Jason said as he gave a thumbs-up. He was the one who was quicker to take action and contemplated much less than the others. He would, more often than not, go with Blackjack and Chu Li’s plans. He always yielded to the young kid’s plans. To have formidable brainpower behind a group of action-takers made for an extremely terrifying force. “I agree with Ning Ning’s thoughts,” Chu Li said. He and Bai Ye agreed with Ning Ning’s thoughts. “Let’s settle everything once and for all lest people forget their place and consistently start a fight. It is not too bad an idea.” “When did I ever rebut Ning Ning? Gee, we are always in cahoots with each other.”  Black J laughed. “This time, however, we ought to teach the Mafia a lesson so that they will stay out of our path even after fifty years from now.” Bai Ye nodded as he had no opinion. He wanted to understand the virus that Third Young Master Ye and Cheng Anya carried. That was critical. Chu Li could handle everything else. Ye Wei and Eleven looked each other in the eye. What was this other ‘power center’? A familiar face appeared in both their minds. Was it Mo Ye and Mo Jue? In the Mafia, they were the only ones who had sufficient clout and yet mysterious. They could not figure out anyone else save them who had the charisma. Since they were leagues above Louis, there was no reason they would listen to him. As everyone else moved toward the living room, the young kid went to look for Cheng Anya, who happened to have had her shower and had a cup of hot tea. Her body was warm and her cheeks were slightly rosy. She sat on the bed and slowly pondered about something as she looked at her fingers. “Mommy…”  The young kid opened the door and entered, smiling as he walked toward her. Cheng Anya turned around and winked. She praised him and said, “Darling, you are sure top-class.” He was, in his dress, really awesome-looking and seemed nowhere near a child. He was simply a dangerous person. “Thank you for the praises, Mommy.” “Don’t come close and sit further away. I’m afraid that I could not help it but spank you.”  Cheng Anya smiled as she pointed toward the sofa. “Sit around there.” The young kid stared at Cheng Anya angrily. “Mommy, you are despising me.” “Indeed.”  Cheng Anya smiled as she looked at the young kid in the eye. She felt that this kid had changed in some way. Although he looked no different from before, mothers, however, understood their child best. Whatever changes the child went, and however well-hidden they were, she could somewhat sense it. “Mommy, why are you looking at me like this? Don’t you think that I am properly handsome?”  The young kid playfully blinked his eyes. He looked extremely adorable. Cheng Anya looked at him with a seeming smile and said, “You have taken quite a leaf from your daddy’s narcissistic streak. That said, have you been okay this while? Be honest to Mommy, okay? Were you bullied?” The young kid shook his head and said, “No.” “Nonsense. Louis showed me a photo of you clearly beaten and bloodied.”  Cheng Anya did not believe and said through gritted teeth, “Even if he is eviscerated thousand times over, it won’t ease the hate in me.” As she recalled what she had experienced, Cheng Anya deeply hated Louis. There was a veneer of coldness across her bright face, and she had an even worse premonition when she thought about what the young kid had experienced. “Mommy, I really am fine. The photo was most likely edited.”  The young kid elegantly smiled and rolled up his sleeves to show a white and tender arm. “See, no injuries.” As the bullet wound on his arm had largely recovered and quickly, he was not afraid of Cheng Anya discovering it at all. And the lashes that he suffered were because of Xu Nuo. Since Xu Nuo was the person who scourged him, he did not feel that he was bullied. Instead, he missed the pain when she walloped him before. If Nuo Nuo were still alive, he didn’t mind her walloping him all day long. “Ning Ning, are you really okay?”  Cheng Anya frowned. She did not miss the hint of pain that flashed through her son’s eyes. The young kid nodded and said, “I am really fine. Mommy, Daddy and you are in a rut. Uncle Black Eagle mentioned that you have caught a virus. How did Daddy catch it too?” As Cheng Anya recalled a horny Third Young Master Ye, she could not help but blush and had no desire to mention what happened. “Don’t ask. We had jumped out of a plane once over the desert, and another time over the ocean. How could we not contact each other?” Miss Cheng replied calmly and the young kid did not doubt her. “Mommy, do not worry. You two will be saved by Bai Ye’s top-notch medical skills.”
