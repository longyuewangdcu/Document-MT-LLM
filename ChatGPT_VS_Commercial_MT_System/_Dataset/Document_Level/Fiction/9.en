“Just to show you around to get a hang of the energy perturbation. It’s very simple,” a sorcerer could not help but chime in, smiling. “Thank you.”  Lin Sheng nodded at him. He needed to find the other fragments quickly. He had thought of conquering more dark spirits to get more pure soul power.  But since he got this opportunity, he was more than happy to take my offer. The head of the sorcerers brought Lin Sheng at one Darkspirit Gate.  They both reached out their hands, touching the frame of the gate with eyes closed.  With his special ability, the head of the sorcerer started to build a dimensional base for coordinate confirmation.  Following that, the ritual perturbation of the Darkspirit Gate was transmitted together with Lin Sheng’s conscious perception. “An ordinary teleportation ritual is point-to-point transmission. ” “But when we explore other dimensional realms, we change it to become one-to-multiple-point transmission. ”  “What we need to do is to make some minor changes to the parameters on the transmission base.”  The head of the sorcerers was guiding Lin Sheng’s consciousness as he taught him the technique.  “This way, the Darkspirit Gate will spontaneously transmit our consciousness into multiple target-dimensions. ” “It is the luck of the draw. If we get lucky, we might bump into the dimensional realm we are looking for. If we get no luck, just try a few more times.” “That’s random enough, though.”  Lin Sheng was dumbfounded. The ritual instantly perturbed his perception the minute he stepped into the Darkspirit Gate, wrapping it inside as it spread out. At the same time, his consciousness seemed to break apart, his perception split into a dozen tiny pieces, feeling the energy in a dozen different dimensions. “Generally, we can’t keep our consciousness in one piece during the transmission. We can only try to remember as best as we can the dimensional coordinates we came across.”  “We need to leave a simple mark on the coordinates…” Outside, the sorcerer chief kept doing the explaining, guiding Lin Sheng how to create the simple marking in determining the coordinate code.  But one thing he had not expected; Lin Sheng’s consciousness was so strong that he could memorize all the coordinates of the dimensions that his consciousness pieces came into.  To Lin Sheng, it was just a matter of multitasking, a skill that he had been training for every day. He could use his split consciousness to direct and observe his every summoned creature, although he could not independently control them at the same time.  Memorizing the perturbation and determining the coordinates were just a walk in the park.  His strong soul played a part and he could stay for a longer time. Ten minutes later, the split consciousness dissipated.  Lin Sheng opened his eyes, looking at the sorcerer chief and others.  Their eyes were on stalks as he told them a specific coordinate of a special dimensional realm.  This realm was the one homologous to the Dark Wheel fragment he carried. “You got it the first time?”  The sorcerer chief could not believe that he heard. He had spent over two months to find and record the coordinate when he sensed the dimensional energy for the first time. “It’s a simple process.”  “Let’s build the portal.”  “I need to go there quickly,” Lin Sheng instructed. “Aye.” “Wait for me.”  Tenko Kasumi spoke to him through telepathy. He froze. “What’s up?”  He went to one side, watching as the sorcerer chief started to direct the dark spirits moving the materials. “There is a situation here in Visaca Island!”  Tenko Kasumi’s voice sounded grave. It was a phenomenon that Lin Sheng had never seen before.  Tenko Kasumi had never been this depressed, even when Lin Sheng told her about the existence of the Night Lord last time.  This made Lin Sheng a little nervous. “Is Mi Yue at an absolute disadvantage?”  Lin Sheng frowned.  “Or are there some new forces joining the battle?” “No. Not new forces,” Tenko Kasumi said.  “It’s Mi Yue; he had deceived everyone!” “What?” “The Sevenlocks Tower has been successful with the summoning. Mi Yue has deceived everyone in the three mysterious realms. He has successfully summoned Faldt, using himself as a sacrifice to make himself as one with it!” It took a while before that sank in. “Using himself as a sacrifice?”  “That madman!” “So what the three mysterious realms face now is a hybrid monster of Mi Yue and Faldt.” Lin Sheng was speechless. “What should we do now?”  Tenko Kasumi asked. The combination of Faldt and Mi Yue was not as simple as 1+1=2; it was 3×10. “Calm down.”  “The three mysterious realms and other forces are still Mi Yue and Faldt’s biggest enemies.”  “There is more to this world than meets the eye.”  The thought of his previous investigation came to mind.  “The Astral Mere and those having the Sacred Vessel of Destiny are no slouch. ” “We will not interfere with what they do so long as they don’t interfere with ours.” “I got what you meant.”  “But we had better be prepared,” Tenko Kasumi said.  “I used to possess that destructive power when I was controlled by the Demonblade.”  “That’s why I know what that kind of power could do.” Lin Sheng was keeping silent.  Tenko Kasumi was his most special commander because some power was used to control her.  At that time, when she traced back her memories, she discovered that Lin Sheng had been peeping at her.  Just through an image imprint in the memories, she knew that Lin Sheng was observing her.  Such a powerful ability was beyond the apprehension of Lin Sheng. “I got it,” Lin Sheng said.  “I will be prepared.”  “Don’t worry.”  If worse comes to worst, he could activate his special state of being by summoning all the commanders to become one with him. He cut off the telepathic communication with Tenko Kasumi, quietly staring at the newly constructed Darkspirit Gate as his thoughts came back to the matter at hand. “It is ready, My Lord,” the sorcerer chief said. Lin Sheng gazed at the portal and remained silent for a while. “Ask for the Fairy King and Djall!” Djall Demonhand had been put on standby in the vicinity.  Hearing the summon, he strode in through the doorway. “At your service, My Lord.” Lin Sheng nodded at him. “I need to open multiple portals to scout out multiple dark-spirit dimensions. ” “Select one hundred great dark spirits, divide them into groups to do the recce.” “Understood!”  Djall Demonhand looked stern, knowing that they had come to some turning point.  Otherwise, he would not have called for such a large-scale operation.
