(Deutsche Welle Chinese Website) After the end of the “Democratic Summit” on Friday, The Foreign Ministry spokesman of China delivered a speech on Saturday (December 11) to express that the “Leaders’ Summit on Democracy” held by the U.S. actually “makes democracy tool-oriented and weapon-oriented based on ideology, to implement anti-democracy with the name of democracy, so as to incite division and confrontation, to change domestic contrasts”. According to the Government of China, “for a very long time, the U.S. has imposed its own political systems and value systems on others, to carry out democratic transformation, and has sanctioned others in a unilateral way, and has instigated Color Revolution, leading to disastrous consequences. Democracy has been the weapons of mass destruction of the U.S. in intervening other countries. The summit was the action that Biden took to fulfill his promise made during the campaign. The meeting of 2 days was held in a way of video, and leaders of 111 countries all over the whole world were invited to attend the meeting, including the leader of Taiwan, China; however, leaders of China and Russia were not invited. China and Russia attacked the U.S. for what was wrong with its own democracy before the summit, and said that the U.S. did not have the qualification to hold such a summit. There were questioned voice internationally and in the U.S.; for example, the U.S. was criticized for some leaders invited to the summit who had the trend of autocracy, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and Biden government was doubted to have the real intention of the geopolitics but not democracy. Scholz, the Chancellor of Germany who had just took the post, was also invited to the video democratic summit. According to the statement made by Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, “The American democracy today greatly shows the morbidity, with increasingly obvious problems such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts and polarization of the rich and the poor”, and the democracy of the U.S. was the “game of the rich” established based on the capital. Biden, the U.S. President, expressed in his speech, “as the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to ideas of our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of Democracy, promote reforms and realize transparent accountability governance, to fight against the power of autocracy and those people who barely intend to pursue for authority before public benefits. “ As he emphasized, democracy is not taken for granted, “we must keep update it in all generations, which is, in my opinion, the decisive challenge of our era. “ Biden also expressed that  with respect to global democracy and human rights, “democracy should be guarded by fighters when facing with continuous and worrying challenges”. As committed by the U.S., there will be year-long actions after this democratic summit, including a proposal with the amount of 424.4 million USD, so as to reinforce global democracy and provide support for independent news media. The U.S. wants all countries to make specific and opened commitments before the democratic summit held in the end of 2022, so as to improve the democratic system.
