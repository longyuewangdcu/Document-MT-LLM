According to the Government of China, “for a very long time, the U.S. has been imposing its own political systems and values on others, carried out ‘democratic transformation’, used unilateral sanction indiscriminately and has instigated ‘Color Revolution’, leading to disastrous consequences. “Democracy has long become the weapon of mass destruction the United States used to interfere with other countries. The summit was the action that Biden took to fulfill his promise made during the campaign. The meetings during the 2-days summit were held via video call, and leaders from 111 countries were invited to attend the meeting, including the leaders of Taiwan; however, leaders of China and Russia were not invited. China and Russia attacked the U.S. for what was wrong with its own democracy before the summit, and said that the U.S. did not have the qualification to hold such a summit. There were doubts internationally and in the U.S.; for example, the U.S. was criticized for inviting leaders who had the tendency to be authoritarians, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some suspected that the real intention of the Biden government was geopolitics, not democracy. German Chancellor Scholz who just took office also attended the video Democracy Summit. According to the statement made by Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, “the American democracy today is morbid, with increasingly obvious problems such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts and polarization of the rich and the poor”, and the democracy of the U.S. was the “game of the rich” established based on the capital. The U.S. President, Biden, expressed in his speech, “as the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to ideas of our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms and realize transparent accountability and governance, to fight against the power of impact of buffer of autocracy and those who bluntly pursue power before public benefits.” He emphasized that democracy should not be taken for granted, “we must keep update it in every generations which is, in my opinion, the decisive challenge of our era.” Biden also said that global democracy and human rights are “facing continuous and worrying challenges, and democracy should be guarded by fighters”. The United States promised that after this Democracy Summit, it will carry out a series of year-long actions including a 424.4 million USD initiative to strengthen democracy around the globe and provide support to independent new media. The U.S. wants all countries to make specific and open promises before the democratic summit held at the end of 2022, so as to improve the democratic system.
