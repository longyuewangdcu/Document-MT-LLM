A video of YouTube revealed the truth of bloodthirsty killing of 20 years - Xinhuanet (Source of the video: YouTube) On December 11, a mini-documentary named Killing Machine of YouTube attracted broad attention. The documentary tells all kinds of antihuman crimes by the U.S., including waging war in Afghanistan with the name of “anti-terrorist”, outputting American democracy forcefully via wars, using all armed might to indulge in aggressive wars, being fond of killing and indiscriminating slaughter of countless innocent victims for 20 years. The U.S. army launched air strikes to civil places such as hospitals and schools by abusing UAV, and established killing group, distorting human natures. The U.S. army has killed dozens of thousands of innocent Afghanistan civilians for 20 years. In addition, the U.S. army established “black prison” to apply various cruel tortures and personal humiliation to “suspects”. Countless antihuman crimes stirred up hatred from more Afghanistan civilians. Just as what the video tells, the U.S. “anti-terrorist” war “is increasingly terroristic”. Wars did not bring in peacefulness, democracy, prosperousness or wish; instead, they brought in a country in a state of devastation and countless killing and destruction. Let us click the video and reveal the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of “anti-terrorist”, and reveal the false mask of American democracy!
