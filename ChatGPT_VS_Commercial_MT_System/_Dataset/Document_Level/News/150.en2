YouTube video uncovers the truth of US army’s bloodthirsty killing of 20 years - Xinhuanet (source of video: YouTube) On December 11, a short documentary named Killing Machine went viral on YouTube. The documentary tells of various kinds of antihuman crimes committed by the US, including launching the war against Afghanistan in the name of “anti-terrorism”, outputting American democracy forcefully via wars, exhausting its resources to build up its military power, being obsessive about bloodthirsty killing, and massacring the innocent at will for 20 years. The US army launched air strikes to civil places such as hospitals and schools by abusing UAV, and established killing squad with distorting human nature. The US army has killed dozens of thousands of innocent Afghanistan civilians for 20 years. The US army set up “black prison” to apply various cruel tortures and personal humiliation to “suspects”. Countless antihuman crimes stirred up hatred from even more Afghan civilians. Just as what the video says, American anti-terrorism war “is creating more terrorism”. The war did not bring peacefulness, democracy, prosperity or hope to Afghan people; instead, they threw the country in a state of devastation and countless killing and destruction. Let us click on the video and reveal the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of “anti-terrorism” of the US, and rip off the false mask of American democracy!
