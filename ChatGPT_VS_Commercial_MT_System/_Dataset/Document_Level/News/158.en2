Don’t scare people off at the starting line - Xinhuanet We can usually feel the popularity of books on success when we go to bookstores. Many books on success nowadays advocate the “best principle”, which first assumes or implies that you can “do it”, and then tell you “what it is” that you need to do. It skips the most important and fundamental link of “how to do it”. As such, these books have one common characteristic; you either work to be the best or do nothing at all; you either be 100 or be 0; you either climb on Mount Tai or stay where you are. The “best principle” will make every reader believe it is “absolutely right”, but 99% of people will be scared off at the starting line. Because this theory advocates a route in which “you have to be resolute to start again and change 180 degrees”, and this happens to be the weakest point of many people. Shouting “you need to change” to people who stick to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change is lying to yourself and casting pearls before swine. The majority of people will be timid in front of “change”, reluctant to move forward or make the decision; or, they have made the decision to “change” on an impulse and bravely taken the first step, but it doesn’t last long and they will lose courage after persevering for while; they cannot be persistent. From Tomorrow On, the famous sketch from Mr. Ma Sanli, most vividly depicts the classic of “common humanity”. The biggest problem of the “best principle” is the threshold is too high; it surpasses the limit of the ability of ordinary people and leave most people “sigh at the beginning”. Or, the “second best principle” perhaps is a route for more ordinary people to be successful. The core of the “second best principle” is lowering the threshold; it encourages “accumulating small successes to have big success”; even if you cannot reach 100, you can be 1, because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you cannot climb on Mount Tai, you can climb on the small dune in front of your house, because that is still better than marching on the spot. Anyway, doing anything is better than doing nothing at all. Due to the dramatic lowering of the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people persevering with it is higher; the success rate will be higher for anything as long as you persevere, It’s just that the journey will be longer if you follow the “second best principle”. In all, although the “best principle” on the surface claims to make everyone successful, it will eventually only encourage few people in actuality; the “second best principle” can effectively encourage more people and make more people actually gain benefit.
