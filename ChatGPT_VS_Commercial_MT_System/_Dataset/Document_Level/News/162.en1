The naked carp resources in the Qinghai Lake have been increased by 7.1 thousand tons - Xinhuanet Message from Xining of the Xinhua News Agency on December 11 (journalists: Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang): According to the information from Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, the latest monitoring results show that the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake of this year have been increased by 7.1 thousand tons when compared with that of the past year, achieving 108.5 million tons, which has accumulated to be increased by more than 40 times than the primary stage of protection in 2002. The naked carp in Qinghai Lake is also known as the “Huang Fish”, a precious type of fish only living in Qinghai Lake, which plays decisive role in maintaining the safety of the“ water-fish-bird” ecological chain and the biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake Basin. During 1960s and 1970s, due to influences of factors such as battue and increasingly degraded environment in the water areas for naked carp, the number of the naked carp in the Qinghai Lake declined sharply; the reserves of the naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons in 2002. The naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed into the endangered species in China Species Red List in 2004. Qinghai Province has implemented closed lake for breeding fish since 2003, and any unit, group or individual is forbidden to fish in Qinghai Lake and main rivers and tributary of the lake region, and the sale or the naked carp or the products is also forbidden. At the same time, the protection intensity has been increased by measures such as artificial proliferation and discharge, cleaning up the river ways of main rivers that flow into Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable “channels for fish”, leading to increase of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake by years. According to introduction by Yang Lin, deputy director general of Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, up to now, totally 180 million naked carp has been conducted with artificial proliferation and discharge in Qinghai Lake, with the rate of contribution to recovery of the naked carp resource in Qinghai Lake of more than 23%. The Sanjiangyuan Region in Qinghai Province is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area for our country or even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area which controls the extension of the west desert to the east. In order to protect the ecological environment of Sanjiangyuan Region and the Qinghai Lake Basin, protect aquatic wildlife and maintain the biological diversity of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai Province has published the announcement of no permission of fishing in key water areas such as the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Qinghai Lake this year, to construct comprehensive fishing prohibition in “two-river and one-lake”.
