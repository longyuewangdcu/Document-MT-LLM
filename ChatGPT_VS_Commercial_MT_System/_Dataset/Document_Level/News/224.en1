Appointment with the starry sky丨The geminid meteor shower will be the maximum on December 14 - Xinhuanet Message from Tianjin of the Xinhua News Agency on December 12 (journalist: Zhou Runjian): according to introduction from astronomical science experts, as the final large-scale meteor shower of this year, the geminid meteor shower as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere will be the maximum on December 14, and people who like meteor shower can observe at the second half of the night on that day. This is the geminid meteor shower shot by An Jiu, a lover of astronomy of Beijing, on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai. Most of the female celestial bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets; however, the female celestial body of the geminid meteor showers is Phaethon, No. 3200 minor planet, which is an apollo type asteroid. The geminid meteor shower is the second known meteor shower that is not “bred” by comets so far. According to introduction from Xiu Lipeng, a member of the council of Tianjin Astronomy Society and an expert of astronomical science, just as a new year blockbuster, the geminid meteor shower generally occurs at the end of a year, with the “show time” during December 4 to December 17. The geminid meteor shower is known for its large size and the stabilization, which is called together with the quadrantal meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower as the three major meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere. The significant characteristic of the geminid meteor shower is the slow speed of the meteoroid, the abundant colors and the large amounts of fireballs; which is suitable for both visual observation and shooting by beginners of astronomical photographers. This is the geminid meteor shower shot by Yang Jing, a lover of astronomy of Tianjin, on December 13, 2020 in Qinghai. Based on astronomical forecast, the geminid meteor shower of this year will be the maximum at about 15:00 on December 14; and the ZHR at the maximum (in the ideal observation conditions, when the radiation point is above the head, the number of the meteors that can be seen every hour) is 150. The recommended index chart of the geminid meteor shower. “In the last year, people were impressed by the geminid meteor shower; however, the geminid meteor shower of this year will be influenced by the moon light, with the splendid degree slightly influenced. December 14 is November 11 in Chinese calendar, with the phase of the moon as the waxing gibbous, and bright moonlight will lead to interference to observation; fortunately, the moon will fail in the second half of the night, and the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower will rise higher. People who like meteor showers can observe it in a few of hours after moon falling in the second half of the night, but please keep warm. ” How to observe as many meteors as possible? “It is suggested to observe meteor showers not in cities but a place of high altitude with wide view, small light pollution, facing to northeast, and then observe with eyes after the falling of the moon. It should be noted that the geminid meteor shower will have large flow on each direction, and do not need to keep staring the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower. People who like photography can select lens with wide angle and large aperture, with high ISO and the maximum aperture while shooting, in order to take blockbusters of meteor showers. By taking stability and sustainability into consideration, a tripod, a standby battery and a shutter release are necessary. ” Reminded by Xiu Lipeng.
