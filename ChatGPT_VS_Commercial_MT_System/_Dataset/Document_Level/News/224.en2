Rendezvous with the starry sky | Geminid meteor shower will usher in the maximum scale on December 14 - Xinhuanet Message from Xinhua News Agency Tianjin on December 12 (journalist: Zhou Runjian) According to introduction from astronomy science popularization expert, as the final large-scale meteor shower this year, the geminid meteor shower as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere will be the maximum on December 14, and people who like meteor showers can observe during the latter half of the night on that day.

The parent object of most of the meteor showers are periodic comets; however, the parent object of the geminid meteor showers is Phaethon, No. 3200 asteroid, which is also an Apollo type asteroid. The geminid meteor shower is the second known meteor shower that is not “bred” by comets so far. According to introduction from Xiu Lipeng, a member of the Council of Tianjin Astronomy Society and an expert of astronomical science popularization, just like a new year blockbuster, geminid meteor shower generally occurs at the end of a year, with the “screening time” lasting from December 4 to December 17. The geminid meteor shower is known for its ample flow and stabilization, which is called together with the Quadrantal meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower as the three major meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere. A significant characteristic of the geminid meteor shower is the slow speed of the meteoroid, the abundant colors and the large number of fireballs, which is suitable for both visual observation and shooting by beginners of astronomical photography.

Based on astronomical forecast, the geminid meteor shower this year will be reach its maximum scale at about 15:00 on December 14, and the ZHR at the maximum (in the ideal observation conditions, when the radiation point is right above the head, and the number of the meteors that can be seen every hour) is 150.

December 14 is November 11 in Chinese calendar, with the moon in the gibbous phase; the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation; fortunately, the moon will go down in the latter half of the night, and the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower will rise higher. People who like meteor showers can observe it in the hours after moon goes down in the latter half of the night, but remember to stay warm.” How to observe as many meteors as possible? “It is not advised to observe meteor showers in the city; you may choose a place facing northeast and has high altitude, a wide view and little light pollution, and then you may observe with your eyes after the moon goes down. It should be noted that the geminid meteor shower will have heavy flows on all directions, and you do not need to keep staring the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower. People who like photography can select wide angle lens and large aperture, and use high ISO and the maximum aperture while shooting if you want to take marvelous shots of the meteor shower. Based on consideration of stability and sustainability, a tripod, a standby battery and a shutter release are also necessary.” Xiu Lipeng reminded.
