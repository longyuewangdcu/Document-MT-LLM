Full coverage of on-water green comprehensive service areas has been realized in the main stream of the Yangtze River - Xinhuanet Message from Wuhan Xinhua News Agency on December 11 (Reporter: Wang Xian): Chongqing Fuling on-water green comprehensive service area was completed on schedule and put into operation on December 10, which was the 2nd on-water green comprehensive service area officially put into operation on the upper reaches of Yangtze River after the Sichuan Luzhou water green comprehensive service area started operation on December 8. Up until now, on-water green comprehensive service areas have covered the upper reaches, the middle reaches and the lower reaches of Yangtze River. According to introduction from Qiu Jianhua, deputy director general of Yangtze Navigation Administration Bureau of Ministry of Transport, before that, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu had constructed and put into use 10 on-water green comprehensive service areas in the middle reaches and the lower reaches of Yangtze River, which had been recognized by sailors and had played an important role in promoting high-quality development of shipping in the Yangtze River. Full coverage of on-water green comprehensive service areas is another milestone event for the construction of green shipping of the Yangtze River, which has greatly improved the abilities of pollutant collection and shipping services of the Yangtze River. As introduced, on-water green comprehensive service areas are important facilities that provide ships and sailors with comprehensive production and living services, and help them solve “emergent and difficult” problems. The two newly established on-water green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are integrated with life services, production services and government services; with environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and emergency rescue services as the features, they realize “multiple services at an anchoring” along the shore, providing sailors working in the Yangtze River all year long with more efficient work and more convenient life.
