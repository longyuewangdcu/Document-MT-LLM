Students played a leading role in the academic annual conference of Zhejiang University, with research achievements of miraculous things - Xinhuanet Washing with air, judging disease with halitus and seeking for source of haze, a series of academic achievements of miraculous things at the opening ceremony of 2016 academic annual conference of Zhejiang University were honored yesterday evening. The main researchers of the achievements are students, with research fields covering environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanistic education; students created high-end inventions with application values from a curious idea, and some of them have been awarded at home and abroad. Biosensor: your family medical examiner The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student of School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone, with the size of only a half of that of a smart phone. “You need only to take a breath, and this set of device can detect your physical conditions preliminarily from the air you breathe. ” According to introduction from Zhang Diming, this set of sensor is connected with a smart phone, and the report of physical conditions will be shown on the smart phone after you take a breath. Most smart wristband detecting physical conditions in the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse. However, this set of biosensor can detect chemical elements by utilizing a new material, i.e., graphene, to reflect the physical conditions in a deeper and more accurate way with sharp “smell”. Smart operating lamp: powerful eyes for doctors In addition to smart phones, smart operating lamps are popular in operating rooms. This invention was awarded with a golden prize in the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland in this year. The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, two postgraduates from School of Opto-electronic Science and Engineering, opened a new idea in defects of traditional operating lamps, inventing the smart LED operating shadowless lamp. “Improper early detection and excision of many diseases are related to operating lamps used by doctors. ” According to Shen Junfei, by taking early inspection of cancers as an example, if doctors cannot see clearly all the tumor tissues, the tumor cells will still diffuse. This kind of smart operating lamp has four lamp panels, which strengthen the distinction degree of different tissues by adjusting the spectrum. During the operation process, doctors can adjust the size of facula, brightness degree, spectrum, color uniformness and shadowless rate at any time according to needs in operation and personal habits. This kind of smart operating lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children’s Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, with favorable feedback. The invention was awarded with the first prize in National Challenge Cup in last October. Washing hands with air: water-saving and cool Most people wash hands by flushing hands with water, with a little soap or sanitizer at most; however, Li Qizhang and his friends invented a set of “hand washing device with air”. When a person stands on the wash basin of the device, his weight can compress the air and make it spray out. “It’s just like an inflator. The compressed air forms flow at the faucet, which is combined with water. In this way, we can wash hands clean! ” According to the chromogenic reaction and the germ residue experiment result: the effect of hand washing in this way is the same as that of the ordinary method. With the driving force of body weight, this device can ensure cleanness degree and save 90% of water, with no energy consumption during the whole process, which is energy saving and environmentally protective. In the last year, at the 2nd global great challenge summit, this invention was awarded with the only gold award among all the global top famous universities.
