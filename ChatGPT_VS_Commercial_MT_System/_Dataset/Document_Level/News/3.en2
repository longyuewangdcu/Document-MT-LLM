Students played the leading role at the Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University with creative research achievements - Xinhuanet Washing hands with air, diagnosing disease through breath, and accurately seeking for source of smog; last night, a series of creative academic achievements were awarded at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University. The main researchers of these achievements are students, with research covering major fields of environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanities education; students created many high-end inventions with application values from a curious idea, and some of them have won awards at home and abroad. Biosensor: your home physical examination doctor The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student of School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone with the size of only a half of a smart phone. “All you need to do is to breathe out, and this set of instrument can detect your physical conditions preliminarily from the components of the air you breathe out.” Zhang Diming introduced, this set of sensor is connected to the smart phone; after you breathe out, the health report will be shown on your phone. Smart bands on the market which can detect health conditions often measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse. This set of biological sensor uses the new material of graphene; its target is chemical elements, and its keen “sense of smell” enables it to reflect the health status of the body more in-depth and accurately. Smart operation lamp: high-functioning eyes for doctors In addition to smart phones, smart operation lamps are now being used in operating rooms. This invention has won the silver prize in the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year. The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, two graduate students from School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, developed a new idea trying to solve the defects of traditional operating lamps and invented the smart LED operation shadow-less lamp. “Improper early detection of many diseases and inaccurate excision are related to operation lamps used by doctors.” According to Shen Junfei, for example, in early inspection of cancer, if doctors cannot see clearly all the tumor tissues in a timely manner, the tumor cells will still spread. This type of smart operation lamp has four lamp panels, which enhance the distinction degree of different tissues by adjusting the spectrum. During the operation process, doctors can adjust the size of light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformness and shadow-less degree any time according to demands of operation and personal habits. This type of smart operating lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Sir Run Shaw Hospital Afflicted to Zhejiang University Medical College and the Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, and received favorable feedback. Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup Competition. Washing hands with air: save water in a cool way Normally, people wash hands by flushing hands with water, with a little soap and sanitizer at most; however, Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of “equipment to wash hands with air”. As long as we stand on the washbasin of the equipment, our weight can compress the air out. “Just like an inflator. The air compressed out can form a flow at the faucet and combine with water. As such, we can wash our hands clean!” Chromogenic reaction and germ residue experiment results prove that the effect of hand washing this way is the same as that of the ordinary method. This equipment is only driven by our weight, which can not only guarantee we wash our hands clean, but also save 90% of water; the entire process has no energy consumption and is energy-saving and environment-friendly. Last year, at the 2nd Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention emerged among all the top universities in the world and was awarded with the only gold award.
