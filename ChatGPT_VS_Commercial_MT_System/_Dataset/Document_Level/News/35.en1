Review on education: What should we do to rescue abducted children? As the famous public service advertising says, “there is no killing if there is no buying”; in a good environment with no demand on “abduction”, if people can prevent and fight against abduction, to make it no benefit to acquire, such crime will not happy again. Recently, the platform for emergency release of missing children information developed by the Crackdown on the Abduction of Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security has been put into operation. This is an Internet information platform, which is established for releasing information of missing children, so that the abducted children can be found back in time. With the name of “reunion”, the App is so warm. With new technological means, the App has not only “artistic” and full of feelings, but also appropriate, practical and effective information means. In order to fight against abduction, the first objective is to find out the abducted children and ensure their security and freedom. The judgment and punishment to the criminal suspect is the secondary thing. With the significance of criminal punishment, there are lots of “major terms” from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education. However, before solving a case, the most important thing is the safety of the victim. There are orders of priority; suspend the discussion on topics with large disputes such as “if death penalty shall be sentenced to suspect of abducting children” before “seeking and rescuing” children; rescuing them is the most urgent thing. According to the experience in solving such cases, traders in human beings usually run away from the crime location as soon as possible. Therefore, every more minute indicates more difficulty in seeking and rescuing of children and solving of the case. In this condition, it is a practical action to establish a platform such as “reunion”, so as to provide an effective method to solve the case and find the children. After all, “crackdown on the abduction” is a big task in need of the operation of the whole legal system. The care of “protecting children” shall be implemented in improvement on legislation, judicial safeguard and careful enforcement for fighting against crime, protecting rights and benefits of children and parents. In addition, we can do better to prevent abduction of children from family to the society. By taking a common case as an example, parents and the child had a rest in the train station, and the parents found their child lost after they woke up. It is unpractical to expect that a child of 2 years old can protect himself/herself sufficiently; however, as parents of young children, adults shall have at least equivalent protection awareness. The father and the mother can take turns in sleeping, or they can protect their child in a proper way, which are the elementary approaches for protecting children from being abducted. Viewing from the other side of crackdown on abduction, the party that purchases the abducted children shall be noticed and punished, too. Any single illegal behavior is generally one link of a long chain. According to the Penal Code, in our country, the legal minimum standard for the crime of child abduction is 5 years; suspects with especially serious plots can be sentenced to death penalty, with properties confiscated. With high minimum standard for the crime and heavy maximum standard, under the trend of the “lightening of punishment”, the crime of child abduction is a crime with relatively heavy sentence. However, there have been lots of cases of child abduction so far. It can be seen that some people have outdated ideas and weak legal consciousness in bringing up children. It is necessary to provide them with legal education. Strict enforcement of laws is insufficient for effective control of the crime of child abduction. If the “market” of buying children widely exists, and abductors keep innovating abduction approaches, forming the pattern of “fighting against” law-executors, the crackdown on the abduction will inevitably be of low efficiency. Therefore, removing outdated ideas and popularizing common legal knowledge contribute to taking a radical cure to child abduction and child buying.
