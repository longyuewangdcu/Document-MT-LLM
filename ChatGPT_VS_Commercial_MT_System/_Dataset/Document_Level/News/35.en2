Education news commentary: What should we do to rescue abducted children? As the famous public service advertising says, “there is no killing if there is no buying”; in a good environment with no demand of “buying abducted children”, if the masses can prevent and fight against abduction together and make abduction an action with no benefit, high risk and cost, then such crimes will not happen again. Recently, the platform of emergency release of missing children information developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online. This is an Internet information platform established as an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and timely finding the abducted children. I feel warm after hearing the App is named “reunion”. This new technical means not only has an “artistic” name and full of warm feelings, but also makes appropriate use of informatization, making itself practical and effective. The first and foremost objective of fighting against abduction is to find the abducted children and ensure their security and freedom. The judgment and punishment to the suspect is secondary. In terms of the significance of criminal punishment, lots of “big words” can be listed from individual punishment and social prevention to legal education. However, before solving an abduction case, the safety of the victims should be priority. There are orders of priority; with the urgent goal of “rescue”, the discussion on contentious topics with divergent public opinions such as “if death penalty shall be applied to criminals of child abduction” can be shelved for now and be discussed with discretion; however, rescuing abducted children cannot be delayed. According to the experience in solving such cases, human trafficking traders tend to run away from the crime scene as soon as possible after the crime. Therefore, with each minute delayed in finding abducted children, the children are farther from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case also increases. In this case, it is a practical action to present a platform such as “reunion” which can help solve the case and provide an effective method to find the children. After all, cracking down on abduction is a major task that requires the coordination of the entire legal system. To crack down on crimes and protect the interests of children and parents, the care of “protecting the young and helping the weak” shall be implemented in the improvement of legislation, and in safeguarding judicial system and meticulous enforcement. In addition, we can do better to prevent abduction of children from the perspectives of both family and society. Take a common case as an example; parents and a child were taking a rest at the train station, and the parents found their child missing after waking up. You cannot expect a 2-year-old child to protect himself/herself; however, as parents of young children, adults shall have at least some degree of protection awareness. The father and the mother can take turns in taking rest, or they can protect their child in a proper way, which are the basic approaches for protecting children from being abducted. Viewing from the other side of the crackdown on abduction, the party purchasing the abducted children shall be given attention to and punished, too. Any single illegal behavior is usually one link of a long chain. According to the Penal Code in our country, the criminal penalty starting point of child abduction and sale is 5 years; suspects with especially serious circumstance may be sentenced to death penalty with confiscation of property. Under the trend of “light sentencing”, the crime of abducting and selling children has a high starting point and heavy maximum standard of sentencing, and thus it is clearly a crime with heavier sentence. However, there are still lots of cases of abduction every year. It is clear that some people are still lagging behind in the concept of raising children and have dim legal awareness. Legal education should be provided to these people. It requires not only strict enforcement from authorities to effectively control the crime of abduction and selling. If the “market” of buying abducted children still exists, and abductors continuously create new ways to abduct children driven by the profits; this will lead to a situation where the criminals and law enforcers plot against each other, and the action to crack down on adduction will inevitably be low in efficiency. Therefore, correcting outdated concepts and popularizing legal common sense are also conducive to eradicating the crime of abducting, trafficking and buying children.
