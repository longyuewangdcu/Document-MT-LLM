The Summit for Democracy ended, and Biden said the fire of freedom would never extinguish The online “Summit for Democracy” held by Biden, the U.S. president, and attended by leaders of governments, civil society and private sector from 110 countries came to a close on Friday (December 10). Biden said in the closing speech that a dictatorship can never extinguish the flame of liberty that burns in the hearts of people around the world. He also said that the second global “Summit for Democracy” was scheduled to be held next year. Tang Feng, representative of Taiwan government and member of the administrative council, and Luo Guancong, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist who is currently in exile in the UK, made speeches at the summit on the second day. Biden said, “We know that we are facing arduous tasks. But we also know that we can meet the challenges, just as I mentioned before and as what this Summit stands for, the world of democracy is everywhere. A dictatorship can never extinguish the flame of liberty that burns in the hearts of people around the world.” Biden also said that joint efforts from the whole society were required to defend democracy. He said, “as leaders of governments, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms, realize transparent accountability governance, so as to be better equipped to resist the buffer and impact of dictatorship as well as people who bluntly pursue power in front of public benefits.” The themes on the second day of the “Summit for Democracy” were strengthening human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting against authoritarians, as well as fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming the values of democracy. That day happened to be “International Human Rights Day”. Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations, said in the opening speech on that day that the democracy was facing challenges globally, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies. He said, “It’s the time to reiterate the common values, standpoint, as well as the tenacity of democracy. Social dialogue needs to be deepened to solve the problem of inequality, fight against corruption, update social contracts, invest in high-quality education, and provide more opportunities for women and girls. This also requires us to condemn populism, nativism and extremism of all forms, including making use of all the tools provided by technical revolutions.” Luo Guancong, democracy and human rights activist from Hong Kong, gave a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, to remind conferees to continuously pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China including Uygur ethnic group and the Tibetans. He said, “For a long time, the world has always accepted the rising of China; however, no mechanism has been established for accountability. This is the reason why there must be cooperation between politicians and civil society leaders. We have to ensure that we will use all (the resources) we have to make the renaissance of democracy our primary task.” Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite together and fight against the threats from the Communist Party of China. He said, “Some of you may be afraid of offend General Secretary Xi Jinping, some of you may not want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you may not realize the threat (of the Communist Party of China) to our democratic values. And this is the reason why we failed. This is also the reason why we must make changes.” When attending the round table discussion on “Striking digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy”, Tang Feng, member of the administrative council of Taiwan, issued Country Declaration with a video to emphasize that Taiwan is on the forefront of fighting against dictatorship and authoritarianism. He also shared experience on how to fight against COVID-19 epidemic with transparent information and the construction of mutual trust. He said, “As democracy in Taiwan is still making progress, we shall always stand on the forefront of fighting against the authoritarianism of the whole world, and shall play the leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights. During the epidemic, authoritarian governments from all over the world rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, leading to retrogress in global democracy. However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without putting cities on lockdown, and we can defeat false information without removing it.” On the second day of the “Summit for Democracy”, Treasury Department of United States announced it would implement legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries including China and North Korea which were identified as having severely infringed on human rights; at the same time, it would implement investment restriction on a Chinese company which was identified as assisting in infringing on human rights by utilizing surveillance techniques.
