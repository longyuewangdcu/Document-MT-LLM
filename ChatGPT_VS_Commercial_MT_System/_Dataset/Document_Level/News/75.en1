Vietnamese People’s Daily – Gulf Cooperation Council coped with common challenges. The places where Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Arabia’s prince, stayed included Oman, The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait. It’s worth noting that it was the first time for Mohammed to visit Qatar since the Gulf Diplomatic Crisis caused by embargo implemented by Saudi Arabia and the Arabian alliances to Qatar in the middle of the year 2017. In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed the diplomatic relations with Qatar and implement comprehensive embargo; they blamed Qatar on supporting terrorist organizations and keeping close relations with Iran. Diplomatic tensions led to serious influences on internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, resulting in negative influences on economy of countries in related regions. The four Arabian countries blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar. The crisis was solved at the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January, 2021, and various gulf countries signed an agreement for “unity and stabilization” with the mediation by the U.S. and Kuwait. Saudi Arabia reopened the boundary with Qatar. Saudi Arabia and Egypt took the lead in recovering the relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar. The divergence of the Arab countries in the gulf was resolved, to recover the relations with Qatar, for the purpose of unity for benefits of various countries and regional stabilization, so as to cope with common challenges. During the period that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia visited Oman, both parties agreed to open the first direct land route channel between the two neighboring countries in the gulf. A channel of 725km connecting between the two countries will provide convenience for travel of citizens and integration of the supply chain of the two countries. The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest 5 billion USD to Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding on cooperation of 30 billion USD. The travel of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to gulf countries coincided with the negotiation on an Iran nuclear deal named as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and major countries all over the whole world, an agreement that was regarded as cannot solve the problem of the guided missiles of Iran by Arab countries in the gulf. All gulf countries have always regarded Iran as the long-term "competitor" and regarded the nuclear program of Iran as the "threat" to regional security. According to various gulf countries, it is defective to not solve the problem of the guided missiles of Iran or not restrain the activity of Iran in this region with certain actions. As the nuclear negotiation between various major countries and Iran cannot meet the demand of various gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted a direct negotiation. The objective was to restrain the upgrading od the tense situations in this region. This is one of the factors that slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council to be held soon will be the first summit for countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council since the end of the dispute between some member countries and Qatar. This is the opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements that make contributions to recovering the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council; at the same time, various measures are proposed to make the member countries cooperate sufficiently, so as to cope with common challenges, to make contributions to stabilization and development of the gulf countries.
