When I hit the gas my Jetta would go into a stall, what’s wrong with it? Is your automatic or manual? Are you sure that you deal with your clutch well? Manual. It wound stall when I hit the gas in Neutral gear, and I checked the fuel injection and ignition and they were fine. Who told you to hit the gas with Neutral gear? Who’s your driving coach? Kill him. Step on the gas immediately after you shift into gear. Stepping on the accelerator in Neutral is unnecessary.
