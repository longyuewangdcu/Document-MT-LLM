Who can find out the IP address of this QQ account for me? I need it to be specific and accurate. He was a liar who cheated me 200 yuan. I suggest you call the police, even though it doesn’t help much. You can only locate him to a certain area using the IP address. You cannot know the exact address only with QQ account. He was using QQ Mobile. Why can’t I open the web page using mobile data? Check the firewall settings. Where to set it? Is it in the system settings? What is your phone model? Check it if it has installed a firewall software. Samsung E220. Why can’t I open the web page using mobile data? The internet speed is too slow, is it a 2G network? Nope, it’s a 3G network. Restart it and check it again. Or try to use another browser, Opera Browser or something. UC Browser isn’t good.
