I have a question. There is a newly opened Internet café nearby and all of its computers are new. It’s totally smooth when playing Need for Speed 14 with all the special effects set to the highest. So the computer setup… The computer setup, the price, even the worst internet café’s computers are installed with discrete graphics card. The computer needs integrated graphics card. 3 years ago. The computers in the internet café can run Need for Speed smoothly. And one computer would cost less than 3000 yuan and it could not run NFS smoothly. Mine costs 4500 yuan.
