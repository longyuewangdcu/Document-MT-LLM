How can I download the Zhiji APP. Is it an application? I’ve never used it before. Is it useful? Give us an introduction of it, poster. I don’t know. I’ve used it on my computer and on my phone as well. But I just don’t know how to download it. You can only log in through webpage. And there is no mobile client, isn’t it?
