My monitor screen always goes into black, what’s wrong with it? (the screen would turn to black 30 seconds after starting, and it would turn to black again after restarting). Something with monitor and motherboard must go wrong. The screen turns into black. And it would temporarily come back to normal, but soon it would turn to black again. A few day ago one of my friends ran into the same situation, and he changed his monitor to solve the problem. That’s a good idea, fix it once for all. Well, pay attention to the price when changing for a new screen, don’t be fooled.
