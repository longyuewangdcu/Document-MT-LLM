Samsung S4 was upgraded to 4.42 system and failed to be rooted with 360 Instant Root. What was going on? Did you instant root it with 360 Mobile? You should connect your phone with your computer, and root it with 360 Instant Root PC version. And the is how I deal with my phone. It worked and several pre-installed programs have been removed, go and have a try. As the title says, my root failed. Hahaha, I’ve no idea then. Sorry I didn’t help you.
