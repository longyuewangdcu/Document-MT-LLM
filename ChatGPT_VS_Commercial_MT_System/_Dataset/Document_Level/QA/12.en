My kid is almost 4 years old, and is raised by grandma at country side. The kid was hit by a car when he went to the market even he tried to avoid it to the roadside. And the car didnâ€™t buy compulsory insurance, so how to divide the responsibility. Take the full responsibility. Because you avoided first and at the road side. Be careful when you are with a kid. Thanks. You are welcome, my pleasure.
