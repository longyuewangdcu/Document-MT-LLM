Samsung S4 was upgraded to 4.42 system and failed to be rooted with 360 Instant Root. What was going on? Upgrading android system would make your phone more lagging, so as the root operation. But it has already been upgraded. Don’t root then. Even tough it is not that convenient to use. It consumes way too much data usage without rooting, for it has a lot of automatic running programs. It’s up to you then. S4 can run smoothly and I suppose it couldn’t be that lagging. I know. But sometimes you add a file such as dos.h, and then the vc appears unnamed.
