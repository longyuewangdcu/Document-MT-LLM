What does the broadband network symbol show? Is it an exclamation mark?  I can only see the network is restricted. My phone connects to it but couldn’t access the internet. Could you access the internet with your computer? How many router did your broadband connect? I couldn’t get access to it. Only one. When did you install the router? If you install it today, then you cannot use it. Or you’ve already used it for a couple of days and you can’t use it anymore all of a sudden. I’ve used it for a month. Suddenly I couldn’t access to the internet, and I didn’t set the router, either.
