How to treat a three-month teddy dog with dander and hair loss? Mine suffered from dander before and it scratched itself steadily. We went to two animal hospital and one said there had been nothing to worry, and the other said it was very serious and my dog needed injection treatment for a month. Check if there are red spots on the skin and they are highly possibly mites. If so, you can use 886, 887 or amitraz. There is no red spot.
