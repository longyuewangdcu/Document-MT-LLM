Samsung Galaxy 3, enter the unlock password and the screen would be locked automatically. Enter the password again and then it would be locked immediately, and it keeps repeating. I’ve tries to turn it off and remove the battery. Have you ever rooted it? It’s the problem of programs then. Reset your phone. Google the detailed method. And then your phone could be unlocked. You mean I need to root it? Nope, just reset it, not root. Google it and you will find out how to reset it. Thanks.
