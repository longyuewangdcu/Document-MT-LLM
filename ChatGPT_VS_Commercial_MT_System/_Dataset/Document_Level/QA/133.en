I took the computer graduate exam, but I was not good at programming. Any direction is basically the same as you do the projects that your tutor gives you. Of course, some tutors don’t do much projects, and then you don’t do anything. No one’s programming capacity is good at first, and it is improved by doing projects. Eh, but I checked the enrollment brochure and it said there were information security and network aspects. Shouldn’t I sign up according to that? I basically only did some management software and so on during the period of undergraduate, and I didn't do anything as a freshman. By the way, may I ask what university are you in? We can have a conversation, haha. I sent you a private message, I’m not sure whether you received it or not.
