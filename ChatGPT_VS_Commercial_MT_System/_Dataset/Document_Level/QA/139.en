What about this computer setup? Be quick, I’m going to buy it. Any geeks could help me out? Fucking awesome. How about playing video games with it? This computer… I think it’s pretty awesome, the RAM is big. And the CPU is great. Here is another picture of it, please have a look. OK. The setup is good, and I think it’s enough. Can it play large video games, such as Cross Fire? Can’t use it up. I just bought a WiFi enhancer but I don’t know how to use it. Download the driver from the official website and then it would be working. Do you mean the wireless network card driver? Yeah.
