I want to change my GPU, any recommendations? Geeks, please check my computer configuration. Configuration GPU is totally a white elephant, especially the CPU, thatâ€™s a bang for the buck. And I suggest adding another 4G RAM. I recommend install type 660 and type 7850 GPU, type 660 has a 15% higher performance than type 7850, and the price is 200 yuan higher, it matches with your configuration, and the mainstream video games could be run smoothly. Sapphire HD7850 1G GDDR 5 Platinum 1099 yuan Inno3 D GTX660 Ice Dragon 1299 yuan. Do you need to change other parts? No needs, no obvious help for performance improving. If you feel that games or software loads slowly, you can think about installing a solid state disk. Of course then, the power supply at least should be 400W, otherwise it may incur instability, cause various problems and influence the hardware life.
