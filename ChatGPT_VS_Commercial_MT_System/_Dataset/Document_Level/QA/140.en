How to put another hard drive into IMB X3650 server. The premise is that you can enter the ServeRAI D Manager or enter RAID setting interface (Ctrl+ A) when the host starts for this model. The hard disk must be configured by the RAID card before it can be recognized by the operating system, so the newly added hard disk must be an Array or a simple volume. The newly added disk cannot be added to the existing Array, only a new Array or simple volume can be generated. So you need the ServeRAI D Manager or use Ctrl + A to enter RAID to create a new array or simple volume. Then detect the hard drive by rescanning, which is in the operating system hard drive management, partition and format it, and it is ready to use if it is equipped with a volume label. The machine label is MT:7979, I cannot open it directly, should I connect a hard drive to it? Is the steps you mentions troublesome? Iâ€™ve never tried to add a hard drive to my server before. There are 6 3.5-inch or 6 2.5-inch and a dds4 tape drive in the front of the machine. Remove the plug where the hard disk is not installed and plug in the new hard disk. There is no data cable to connect.
