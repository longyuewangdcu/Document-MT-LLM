My laptop is installed with Windows 8 system, and there is one partition. Please help me how to make it 4 partitions and install the Windows 7 system with the system CD. It’s easy, QQ me, and you follow my instructions step by step. There would be too much typing. Do you charge for any fees? Er, I’ll teach you for free.
