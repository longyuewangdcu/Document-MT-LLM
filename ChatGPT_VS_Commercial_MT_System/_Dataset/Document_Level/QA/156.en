Partition the disk with one more section and how can I merge it? With what tool? Use Acronis Dis k Director Suite, it’s a lossless partition tool, which I’ve used for three or four years. I once helped a friend to partition Windows XP, and there is a merge function in Windows 7. Use Acronis Dis k Director Suite then. Is it in Chinese? Is it hard to learn? I want to divided the extra disk evenly to into the other four disks. Formerly it was in English, I like to use the English version, for it’s stable. And there is a Chinese version, but I am afraid that there might be a problem. If you mess up with the partition you might lose some data. There might be the Chinese version now, you can process it first. When the partition meets your demands, click the apply and then the partition begins, which is required to restart it. And then you just wait. Don’t cut off the power, or it’s going to be troublesome. Divide into 4 partitions evenly is out of question, it’s just you have to do the math. For example, you have 10G capacity to partition, then gives 2.5G for each partition. That graphic interface looks clearly. Personally, I recommend you to install a virtual machine first. Partition the virtual as a practice, and process it when you get familiar with it. Safety first. I’ll download one to have a try.
