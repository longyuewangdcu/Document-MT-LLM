The initiating speed of Office Excel is slow, what can I do with it? If the file is big and the speed would be slow. If there is no problems with the computer then it might be the compatible issue of the Office. Check the antivirus software first, which differs from others. Some antivirus software is compatible with Office software. Now the problem is that everyone’s computer has the same problem, and I think it’s not the configuration issue. Or I feel like the initiating time being too long is related to Print Spooler service, but I’m not sure how to set it up. Additionally, I’ve tried to open it with WPS, which tuned out to be faster. But the sheets themselves are relatively complicated. The compatibility between WPS and Office is not perfect.  File edited by WPS might have a format error when opened with Office, which even needs to be fixed. If possible, add a SSD solid state hard drive, which can greatly improve the running speed of the whole set.
