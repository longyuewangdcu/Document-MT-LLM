The router cannot access the internet. Enter the router interface, network parameters, WAN settings, and select the connecting automatically, and then click save. It’s always been the connecting automatically. The picture shows that it is connecting when required. That picture updates every 5 seconds. If you didn’t send the wrong picture, then follow my steps: network parameters, WAN settings, MAC address copy, copy MAC address network parameters, WAN settings, and then select the connecting automatically and click the save button afterwards.
