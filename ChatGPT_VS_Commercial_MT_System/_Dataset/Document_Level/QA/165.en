I withdraw 1200 yuan from the Bank of Communications, when should I give it back. You withdraw some cash with your credit card? There are billing date and repayment date, every bank has its own dates. You should return it before the date. Please adopt my answer. Yeah, I withdraw some cash with credit card, and I donâ€™t know the date. Call the customer service to avoid missing the repayment date.
