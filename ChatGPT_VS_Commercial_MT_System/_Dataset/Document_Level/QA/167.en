Why can’t my computer connect to the router? It couldn’t process at the step of automatically obtaining IP address. It can’t obtain it automatically. And the system is Windows 7. Try it on other devices, like if your phone could detect that signal and link to it. If there is no other devices, restart the router, which means plug off and plug in the power of the router, which is commonly seen. My phone could detect the signal, but it doesn’t work. Then try to restart the router. Additionally, did your router connect to internet? Namely, did you set the internet account? Seems that I didn’t. How could you access the internet then? If the router is newly bought, you won’t access the internet until you set the dial link in the router. Okay, thanks. I’ll try again later. And I’ll consult you when I’m stuck, OK. Okay, if you don’t know how to do it you can follow the instructions, or you can call the customer service. Don’t be anxious, try it for several times and it would be done.
