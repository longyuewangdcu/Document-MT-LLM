Does the newly opened online store for a month have the record of the transaction order? Generally when you open a online store, you ask for acquittances to buy things and give you good remarks, or you sell the Q coin or do the virtual business such as top up to accumulate popularity. Did you answer my question? I mean there must be some transaction orders if the owner is not stupid.
