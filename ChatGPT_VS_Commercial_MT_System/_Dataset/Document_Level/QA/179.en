Are there any families with twins? My twin daughters are more than two weeks old and they would fight over something such clothes and toys I bought for them. The same. The kids are too young. Make them more united or they would treat each other like enemies when they grow up. Actually, the solutions to that problem do exist. Call the younger one over at night and tell her that you should listen to your sister and your sister would protect you. And then tell the elder one that you should take care of your sister. It’s easy to get them done when they are young. And the mom should be more patient. It’s OK. Come on! It doesn’t work, the way you mentioned is repeated day by day. And they responded with a nod and a yes. But when they started fighting it’s totally another situation.
