Are there any families with twins? My twin daughters are more than two weeks old and they would fight over something such clothes and toys I bought for them. Actually we are in the same situation. But I would tell you a method. For example, if you buy toys for children, donâ€™t give them immediately. You could make them complete something that is neither too easy to complete nor too hard to complete. And the first kid to complete could pick the toy she likes. But it must be done after helping her sister to finish her task. Ah, being a parent is hard.
