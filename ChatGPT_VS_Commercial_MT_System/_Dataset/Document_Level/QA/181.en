Are there any families with twins? My twin daughters are more than two weeks old and they would fight over something such clothes and toys I bought for them. These two girls’ characters don’t complement each other. Yeah, they’re all stubborn. Do you take them to the early education class? Now is the personality formation period for her, and you should treat her well. My daughter is just one year old, and she got a bad temper as well. Why are children so difficult to raise nowadays?
