I lost my ID card. Could anyone tell me how can I get my boarding pass without it in detail, please? Thanks. Do you have driver license, passport, or household register? Anything that matches your ID number will do. Can I get my boarding pass with my driver license? It seems you canâ€™t. Okay. You could. I once used it to take a high-speed train, but I never used it to take a plane. You can turn to the station staff for help, there are supposed to be the police service windows where you can apply for a temporary ID card, you can go and ask for help.
