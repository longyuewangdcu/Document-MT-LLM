My company requests the staff to have a car to continue to work, and they would give me 88 yuan for car subsidy. If you don’t have a car, you have to quit. What brands of cars do you have, please? You buy a second-hand QQ, it’s the cheapest. It’s way too expensive and my company demands us buy new cars. What price range are you in? 10 thousand yuan and registering license plate, less than 20 thousand yuan in total. You could buy an electric car, it costs you more than 10 thousand and no license plate is needed.
