My company requests the staff to have a car to continue to work, and they would give me 88 yuan for car subsidy. If you don’t have a car, you have to quit. What brands of cars do you have, please? BYD F0. Alto. They are too expensive. What company it is? That’s too ridiculous. I could do nothing. A van would do.s Or you can buy a elderly scooter, it consumes gas but no plate is needed. Elderly scooter? Yep, it’s for sale where it sells motorcycles. It would cost you thousands, but won’t exceed 10 thousand.
