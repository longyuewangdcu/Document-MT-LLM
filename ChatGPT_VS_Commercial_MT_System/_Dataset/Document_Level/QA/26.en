My company requests the staff to have a car to continue to work, and they would give me 88 yuan for car subsidy. If you don’t have a car, you have to quit. What brands of cars do you have, please? It’s too expensive. I just have more than 10 thousand yuan, including the expense for registering the plate. It’s the cheapest. You can buy a second-hand one. It costs less than 10 thousand. I want a brand new car.
