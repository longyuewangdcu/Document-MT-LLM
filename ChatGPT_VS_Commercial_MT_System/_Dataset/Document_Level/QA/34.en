My last name is Shang. Please help me with a name for my daughter, which is snappier, catchy and meaningful. I’m anxious, thank you. Yiyi Shang, Yao Shang. I know someone with that name, it’s a duplicate. Er… Honey, do you have more suggestions? Tong Shang… Qi Shang… I’m sorry but it’s still a duplicate. Giving a name is puzzling.
