I’m nearly 200 pounds and trying to lose weight, but what should I do with my greediness of having soy-braised pork and instant noodles, especially at night. When I wake up I want to eat meat, am I … Losing weight cannot merely rely on diet, you should do more exercise and have a reasonable diet. Having a walk makes me tried let alone doing exercises, it would kill me. But thanks anyway.
