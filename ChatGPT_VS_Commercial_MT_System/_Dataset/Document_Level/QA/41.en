I posted a tweet saying that my waist is not comfortable. And that girl commented it like youâ€™ve done too much bad things. Damn it, I was so wronged. I was preparing to make a pass at her. Do I still have any chances? What did she mean? She was obviously joking. Oh, she was joking then. Not too many women these days are conservative these days.
