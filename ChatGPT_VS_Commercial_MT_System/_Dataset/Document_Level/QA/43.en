I posted a tweet saying that my waist is not comfortable. And that girl commented it like you’ve done too much bad things. Damn it, I was so wronged. I was preparing to make a pass at her. Do I still have any chances? What did she mean? She means you have way too much sex; you couldn’t understand that? No I didn’t. You could do nothing about that if she must think of it that way.
