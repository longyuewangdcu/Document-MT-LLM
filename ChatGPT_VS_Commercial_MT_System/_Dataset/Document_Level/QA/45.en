May I ask you geeks what is the website hosting? Does every website have website hosting using FTP to upload data? Please tell me in detail. Every website has its own web hosting. Oh. How can I check it? Is it a enterprise website? If so, the server would give you an administration account after you purchase their web hosting, and they would give you an address and account and password. You can check the details of the web hosting after signing in. You can now call your web hosting server and let them to give you the administrative authority, and then you can see them. Oh, itâ€™s a website created on Fanke Network. Mine is of no charge. Yes.
