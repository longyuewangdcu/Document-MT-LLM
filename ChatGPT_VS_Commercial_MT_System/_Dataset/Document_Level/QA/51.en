May you geeks help me, could this setup be capable of running large games without special effects smoothly, and running mold drawing? How much do I need to pay for an extra graphics card? Itâ€™s totally OK, and the graphics card would cost you 700 yuan. Just about that. Can get it in less than 3000 yuan? This is a setup recommend by one of my friends, and he uses it as well.
