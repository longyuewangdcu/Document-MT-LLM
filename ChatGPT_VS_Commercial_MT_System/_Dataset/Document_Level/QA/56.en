I bought fake goods on Tesco, and does anyone know the telephone number? Online shopping supports return of goods within 7 days, and you can call 12315 to complaint. Are those complaint telephone numbers the same? I want the specific one to Tesco. Yeah, 12315 is the complaint and report number for consumers. You can return the goods. I called but they didnâ€™t answer.  And I messaged them and received no replies. He was playing a missing with me. Make a complaint against him then.
