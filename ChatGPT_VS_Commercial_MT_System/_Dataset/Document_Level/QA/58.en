Youku APP couldn’t run after installation and what’s wrong with it? The Youku APP mobile version only supports hard decoding, and the mobile phone’s CPU could run it. It used to run well. But it doesn’t work after resetting. It’s because of the video differences. It’s the matter of computer hardware. Okay, it’s an old computer, and I just want to play it. And I want to upgrade the setup. I suggest adding another 2G RAM, and the graphics card should be changed to GTS450. And then there is no need to invest more.
