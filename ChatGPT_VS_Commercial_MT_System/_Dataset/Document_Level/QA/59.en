The CPU sucks. Is it necessary to change it? The motherboard is too old as well. And the mainstream CPUs are not compatible with it. So if you mean to change the CPU, then the motherboard needs to be changed as well, which means that the whole set would be changed, and in such case it’s not as good as setting up a new one. Please give me more instructions/ Enter the BIOS. Start your computer, and click the reset button on the premise that you’ve already backed it up. I can’t start it up and that’s the problem. You need to restore the system.
