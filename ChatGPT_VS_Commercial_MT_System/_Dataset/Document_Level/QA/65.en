Is it easy to get a job with an Associate Degree from the University of Science and Technology Liaoning? It’s gonna be problematic for graduates who learnt some technique with bachelor degree to get a job, let alone a girl who majored in accountant with an associate degree. Do you know the UCTL? I don’t know much about it. Is it in the first batch of universities? It’s in the second batch. Some majors are in the first batch. Oh, I see. It’s a school in the second batch with some majors in the first batch. Yep.
