Can this computer be installed with Windows 7 system? Sure, it can be installed with a 64-bit windows system. I don’t really want to buy a Windows 7 compact disc and I don’t know how to deal with it with U Disk, either. What should I do? Download one and put it in the last disk, and then download a Recovery Genius and put it there, too. Put the downloaded program into a folder and remember its name, and then unzip it within the same folder, after that you start the Recovery Genius to recover the system.
