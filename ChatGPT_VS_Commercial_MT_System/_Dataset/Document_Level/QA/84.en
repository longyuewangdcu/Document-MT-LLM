A cable TV cable and a red and white audio cable were buried during the renovation. And what comes out of the set-top box is one red, one white, and one yellow line. So one yellow line is missing. Can I take the cable TV line and connect it to the yellow head? Use one less audio cable and use it as the video cable. Pay attention to what I was asking. What I buried is old cable TV line, and I don’t want to pave the cables anymore, I just want to use the old cable TV line as the yellow cable of the tricolor cable. Would it work? The network worked well yesterday, but it couldn’t link to the broadband toady. It displays 651, which is linked to a router. And it didn’t work when I plug it off and connect a network cable to it. But when I link to the router… Link the router, get access to the internet, no response when I click the remote computer. Might be a problem with the network cable. Call the customer service. My phone couldn’t access the internet when linked to the router. It might be a problem with the settings or the network cables. You can call the customer service and let them come over and check it tomorrow. Great, you reply solves my problem perfectly.
