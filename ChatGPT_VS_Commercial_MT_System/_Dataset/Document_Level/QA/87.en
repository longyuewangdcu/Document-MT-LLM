Can I set up the router with my phone logging in the router? It must be a computer to set up a router. That two screenshots are from my phone. Set it up with your computer. ASUS laptop network cable interface is snap-on type, making the network cable loosely connected. It needs something to withstand it and then it can access the internet. How can I fix the problem? Chances are remote to have that situation. Try it with a standard network cable, and if it wouldn’t work, then contact the customer service. I don’t know what the standard network cable is. I just bought one from a store in school. May I ask where I can buy the standard network cable?
