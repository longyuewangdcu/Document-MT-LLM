Is there any APP that can restrict the background APPs of android starts itself? Locked once and then never starts? Hi, you  can use Mobile Manager, 360 Mobile Guard or Tencent. From a Tencent volunteer. Honestly, the 360 is better. But since I’m in the company so I must recommend the company’s software. How much do they pay you? I was in Yixun Network before. And they would pay you half less after you resign. Tencent is too cruel. Sorry, it’s not allowed within the company. We’re just volunteers. Salary is certainly not as, you know, as its staff.
