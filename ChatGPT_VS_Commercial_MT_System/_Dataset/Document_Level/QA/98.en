I’ve already added a bank card into Ali Pay and the seller on Taobao said the refund would be transferred into the Alipay. I wonder what is the difference when compared with transferring into a bank card? Did you bind a debit card or a credit card? If it was a credit card, the refund would go there directly, but it might take one or two days. If it is a debit card, the refund could be withdrawn from Alipay to debit card. Debit card. Once the refund is received, it would be displayed in balance, unless you’ve withdrawn it already. But the balance is still 0. I’ve never withdrawn before. It seems that they refunded you 8 yuan, and you topped up your mobile phone for 10 yuan, actually you’ve just paid 2 yuan, so that 8 yuan refund have been used to top up. Nope. The income and expenditure details show that the balance is 10yuan and the seller refund me 8 yuan. I’ll transfer another 2 yuan to see what happens. But the account balance is still 0. Could it be in the Yu’ebao? Yu’ebao is 0 as well. I’ve no idea then. It might take time for the refund to process. I’ve already added a bank card into Ali Pay and the seller on Taobao said the refund would be transferred into the Alipay. I wonder what is the difference when compared with transferring into a bank card? It depends on the seller. They would choose the convenient way for them. The seller said the refund had been transferred to Alipay. And Alipay prompted that some money was transferred in. Yeah, it’s normal. If they only refund you, and it could be automatically used with other bound bank card when shopping on Taobao next time even if it is insufficient. It doesn’t affect anything. I still don’t get it. Could elaborate on it in a simple way? Hah, next time you buy things from Taobao, the system would automatically prompt that the refunded money could be used. But I didn’t receive any tips. No tips popped out when I buy things after. Install the Taobao APP and it would give you the prompt. You can pay it using a quick payment. I’m sure that the tips could been seen. I’ve already added a bank card into Ali Pay and the seller on Taobao said the refund would be transferred into the Alipay. I wonder what is the difference when compared with transferring into a bank card? If you paid it with your bank card, the refund would go to your bank account, and if you pay it with the balance in your Alipay, the refund would go to your Alipay. I paid it with online banking, why did the refund go to my Alipay? Did you check your bank account? It didn’t show that. It would take one or two days. Did you bind a bank card? Yes, I did. Then that would go directly to your bank account, take it easy! The thing is, I didn’t receive it in my bank account, and the Alipay balance is 0 as well. But there is a refund history in the income and expenditure detail.
