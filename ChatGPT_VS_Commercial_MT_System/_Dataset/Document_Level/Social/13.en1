I’ll tell my conclusion first; Only Fools Rush In is a terrible film, in every sense. But the film has one bright spot, i.e., the background music. Terrible films can be divided into many types, including the films make you sleepy in the cinema and the films make you angry after seeing them; Only Fools Rush In is just like monkeys in Mount Emei, which can kindle your fury after you seeing the film. Han Han is really a talent in insulting film viewers. The most terrible thing of this film is that it is just like a creature of the Cthulhu school novels, which is nameless, filled with defects. You may doubt if there is a metaphor implied by the director after you see it; however, you can find it totally a piece of shit after thinking over it. I’ll introduce some plots that I cannot understand. The leading actor lived together with his grandma in an island in south China. His grandma had a wish of seeing snow, and an uncle of the neighbors drove her to see snow in northeast China with a minibus. An elderly took a minibus to see snow from south China to northeast China? ? And the leading actor and his father were at ease about it. Then the whole film tells nothing more about the grandma. In addition, running a restaurant in a wasted ship, how did the female leading role’s elder brother acquire the business license? How could a punk on the island close a section of mountain road so easily? ? A car delivering reinforcing steel bars was parking at roadside, but there was no truck driver anywhere around. The sense of prop is so obvious. How did a punk with poor credit record and suspicion of violation of law become an auxiliary police officer? Why didn‘t the person call the police when facing with the usurious loan, and the police specially asked if there was a trouble? An adult who knew how to use smart phone but did not know how to open the door of the hotel with the room card, who was arranged as staying overnight by sitting out of the room because of failure in finding the boss of the hotel? The film is full of such inexplicable plots; the plots are too ridiculous that I even feel painful when I recall them every time. In addition to the plots, the purport of the film is even worse; or we can say there is no purport in the film at all, and it is just a monster of stitches. You may feel that this is a comedy at the beginning of the film; however, 20 minutes later, you may guess it a motivational film; when seeing a half of the film, you may feel it a story film that reflects difficult life of young people living in a town; you don’t know what you see after you finish it, followed by deep self-doubt that why do you see a piece of shit in a cinema during the Spring Festival. Most people are familiar with the routine of various types of films; for example, if you want to film something about a motorbike, the motivative film + comedy can be adopted, to tell film viewers the way for a talented green hand to go to success. If you want to film something about love, you just tell the resentment between a young man passionate in driving motorcycle and a waitress. If you want to reflect the reality, at least there should be nothing contradict with things in the normal world in your plots. (Such as the character who sang songs after his new motorcycle was just burned played by Yin Zheng); please don’t kindling a headcanon. I don’t know if it is about the acting skill or the requirements from the director that the female leading actress behaved like a child of 5 years ago since she did not suffer from mental retardation. There is another point that I cannot understand: why is Han Han keen on adding some plots about traffic collision in his films since he is a racing driver? Is such a film arranged during the Spring Festival, so as to make film viewers unhappy and angry?
