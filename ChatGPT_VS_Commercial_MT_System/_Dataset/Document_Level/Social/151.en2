I came across the following article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspective of business and shelf life; although canning is deep processing and is not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text perhaps can explain why the customer wants to do this. I have visited many milk powder manufacturers and gained contact with many production lines of milk powder. Actually, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and in cans are exactly the same. Then you may ask: why is the shelf life of milk powder one year in bags and two years or longer in cans? Or you may ask: why are the prices of bagged and canned milk powder so different? Actually, from this point of view, many consumers or mothers think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different. Actually, the raw materials are the same, and people just think the goods are more expensive because they are better. There are also customers in this mindset who say that the taste is indeed different after drinking it! Now I will introduce why the canned ones are expensive. Why are the prices so different when the raw materials are the same? When the manufacturers set the price, they know that if they price too high, it is difficult for the customers to accept and the profits will be very low for the manufacturers or there will be no profit at all; then what will the manufacturers live on? Therefore, in the price setting of the canned ones, they set it much higher to guarantee their profits. As a result, many manufacturers recommend canned ones instead of bagged ones. Just think about where the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions yuan advertising fee of the manufacturers come from every year. Everyone knows it. With the development of society, the market promotion expenses kept increasing, such as the cost of promotion personnel at shopping malls, the display expenses of products at shopping malls, the cost of gifts of products, advertising expenses, etc. Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products in can packaging, and the price kept rising as well; in fact, these new product are introduced due to the increase of market costs. The main objective is to gain more profits; the increased cost of raw materials is actually no more than 3 or 4 yuan. There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, cooperate with doctors in the hospital by all means, and ask them to assist in the promotion of products, drawing profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from one can. China’s relevant laws by no means allow such operations because this practice is in fact harming consumers. It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and put it into cans if you have cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation time and hermetic seal of milk powder; it won’t have any influence on the children. Also, don’t think that the shelf life of canned ones is longer than that of bagged ones; the shelf life of canned ones is the same as that of bagged ones after unpacked; it’s just that bagged ones are not easy to be preserved and are easy to become damp and deteriorate.
