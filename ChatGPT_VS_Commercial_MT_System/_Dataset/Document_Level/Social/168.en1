I’ve just read a very long article about girls’ menstruation. I’ll popularize it to men. Most girls experience the first menstruation during 13 – 15 years old, and amenorrhea will come at about 50 years old. Then the menstruation comes regularly once every month in condition of good health. However, it is not very accurate, and there is a tolerance of about one week, in need of preparation in advance; it may come several days earlier if girls have bad luck. Time duration, blood volume and dysmenorrhea degree vary with each individual; some girls need three days and some others need one week; some girls have small amount of blood volume and some others have extremely large amount; some girls have no reaction at all, but it is so painful for others that they are taken to the hospital by an ambulance; dysmenorrhea changes with time, and some girls suffer from dysmenorrhea suddenly although they did not suffer from it at all. Girls’ menstruation cannot be controlled, and it bleeds 24h a day within those days; all what girls can do is to prevent blood from bleeding to clothes or chairs with menstrual pads or tampons. Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused because of the secretion of the prostaglandin; oral taking of ibuprofen before the menstruation can solve the dysmenorrhea of the current month; however, nothing will work after the start of the menstruation. Girls may have loose bowels before the menstruation due to metryperemia and too much release of prostaglandin. If girls have loose bowels around the period, menstruation will come within two days. It is suggested to change the menstrual pad every two or three hours, or it may breed germs; the menstrual pad shall be changed for at least 6 times a day if sleeping time is excluded, 7 days a month, and 42 pieces of menstrual pads are needed for each period; there may be 50 pieces when taking the ones for preparation in advance. (I’ll make a correction, and it is not necessary to change the tampons, about every five or six hours, eight hours at most). Girls may be irritable during the period due to hormone, and they may have instable emotions due to changes in hormone; in a word, it just like body makes them feel awkward. However, according to crime rate disclosed by official data, girls have very high ability in emotion control, and they don’t seek excuses for emotional problems. The articles bleeding out include both blood and the endometrium falling off. The endometrium after the menstruation every month is the thinnest, and then it gradually gets thicker; it can be understood like this: the uterus is a house, and the house is built every month (the endometrium gets thicker) to welcome the guest, but the guest does not come, and the house is taken down totally (the menstruation is discharged), and a new house will be built the next month; it goes round and round. Menstruation leads to inconvenience to girls; girls bleed 24h a day for several days a month in continuous dozens of years; who want to suffer it? However, only girls with period can give birth to a baby, and menstruation; menstruation is coming in order to prepare for the house babies will live when they come to the world; people shall be grateful to the regular menstruation of their mother. Women were often suppressed in the past, and some things were described as dirty and ashamed; however, times have changed. If somebody feels menstruation disgusting, which is the behavior of women in order to give birth to a baby, they should not say it publicly; girls shall not have such an idea, and men who do not understand it shall not be ungrateful; how can they face their mothers and have their own babies with this attitude? Girls can have a try of tampons, and they are really good.
