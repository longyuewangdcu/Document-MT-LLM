Metaphysics means studying with rational reasoning and logic, but not acquiring answers directly from perception. Metaphysics is the basic principle for philosophy, which aims to explain the existence and the basic nature of the world. The Chinese translated name of “metaphysics” was acquired from “metaphysics is known as idea, and physics is known as device” in the Book of Changes, Copulative, upper volume, which was translated from metaphysic by Tetsujiro Inoue, a Japanese man (the meji era). Metaphysics includes some branches, i.e., the ontology, the natural theology and the extended issues. The ontology is “to study which nouns represent for authentic entities and which nouns represent for only a concept”. The metaphysical naturalism means denying the existence of God. According to the theoretical basis, all the phenomena can be explained with the concept of natural reasons, proposed by scientists supporting science and the theory of evolution. Methodological naturalism refers to the research method not to speak a single word about God. Philosophy of mind is a brand of philosophy in research on consciousness and the nature of the relation between consciousness and the flesh (especially the brain). The dualism and the monism are two main schools of ideas discussing on “relationship between soul and flesh”. Theory of knowledge is a branch of philosophy in research on essence, origin and scope of knowledge. Moral philosophy is a subject in research on systematic thinking and research of moral life of people; here the morality is defined as all the standards of behaviors identified by a group of people or a culture. It is mainly divided into the meta-ethics (which researches on theory of ethics in an abstract way) and the normative ethics (which evaluate on different moral values in a critical way, and gives suggestions on moral code for correct or incorrect behaviors. It conducts research on what kind of moral behavior code shall be observed by people), the applied ethics (the science that applies the theory of ethics to practical living conditions, including biological ethics and political ethics, etc.) and descriptive ethics (which collects information about how do people live, and makes conclusion from the observed patterns. Its viewing on ethics does not start from a preconceived theory, but a true decision made based on investigation on actual moral agent which can be observed; it promotes all the moral elements of the decision, and discusses on the ethics held by social groups).
