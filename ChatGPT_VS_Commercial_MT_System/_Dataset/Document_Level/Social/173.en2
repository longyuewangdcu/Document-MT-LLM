Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception, but only through rational reasoning and logic. Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world. The Chinese translation of Metaphysics originates from “the metaphysical is the Tao, and the physical is vessel” in the Book of Changes, Texts of Hexagrams, and was translated from metaphysic by Japanese Kajiro Inoue (Meiji era). The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extended questions. Ontology is the “study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns only represent a concept”. Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God. Its theoretical basis believes all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, which was put forward by philosophers who support science and evolution theory. Methodological naturalism refers to the research method of keeping silence about God. Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain). Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought to discuss the relationship between “mind and body”. Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that discusses the essence, origin and scope of knowledge. Ethics is a discipline which carries out systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture. It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (study of the essence of ethical theory or criticism in an abstract way), normative ethics (judge different moral concepts, and to give moral code suggestions for correct or wrong behavior). It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the research where ethical theory is applied to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics), descriptive ethics (collect information about how people live, and summarize from the observed patterns. Its examination on ethics does not originate from the expected theory, but it investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, all the moral factors leading to this decision; it studies the ethics held by social groups). The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics. Part I: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne. Part II: the ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin. Part III: political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others; modern ethics (17th-18th century, British empirical ethics, representatives: Hume et al., 17th-18th century, European rationalist ethics, representatives: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representatives: Voltaire et al., 18th-19th century, German academic ethics, representatives: Kant, Hegel et al., 18th-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representatives: Bentham, Sikivik et al., 19th century, Britain National evolutionary ethics, representatives: Spencer, Huxley, et al., late 19th century, German Neo Kantian ethics, representatives: Li Kaier et al., late 19th century, Neo Hegelian ethics, representatives: Thomas Hill Green et al.), transitional Ethics (irrational ethics, representatives: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche et al.). Logic is a discipline which studies “the principles and standards of valid argument and proof”. Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic. Aesthetics is a discipline which studies the essence and significance of beauty.
