A freshman in programming who would like to share personal experience If you want to work in this industry, you can accept training in an institute; however, if you don’t intend to work on it, you’d better study independently; after all, you need to pay a lot of money for training; in addition, it spends you 6 months to do so. However, if you intend to work on it, training is a really good choice, especially for those people with weak self-control ability. People who have strong self-control ability can choose self-study, but it will be more tired. Of course, it is very important to choose a good training institution. Firstly, the most important thing is the teaching strength of the training institution; it’s meaningless for you to choose a training institution with weak teaching strength; of course, new training institutions usually do not have very strong teaching strength. Secondly, you can ask something about the training institution before making selection; you’d better ask something from students of the training institution; after all, only students of the training institution can know it well and know the teaching quality. Hello, in fact, I don’t know how to answer it, because you do not introduce your conditions; in addition, study is closely related to conditions of students. For example, specialty, age, targeted language or even city are related to your study or your intended industry. If you are a student in school or a graduate of computer major, and you have sufficient time, you can learn it by yourself, with favorable efficiency and the lowest cost; a lot of offline or online training institutions are good choices, but with high study cost and much time, and concentrated training of 3-6 months is required. However, if you are of the condition that I mentioned before, self-study is the best choice; there are lots of free study resources in the Internet, or you can seek for training resources in b station; if you don’t know how to find the resources, you can contact me with the method in my introduction, to acquire free resources, or you can have detailed consultation to me. In addition, some classical books can be utilized, in combination of videos. If you are not a computer major and you can afford the training fee and the time cost, you can study in a training institution; in this way, you can study easily, for teachers there will give you detailed explanation and answer your questions; in addition, they can help a lot in study planning or supervision. In addition, employment agreement will be signed by lots of training institutions, with internal recommendation quota, and you can be commended to work for a company; it helps really a lot in the interview of job search. This is my opinions; I cannot have a detailed introduction because I don’t know a lot about your conditions; if you have any other question to ask, you can contact me at any time for communication.
