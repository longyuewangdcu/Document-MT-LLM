2. Although the Rightists had their time in history, it was not long, and the reason why it was short was they were over their head once they got a tiny bit of sweetness; a little success will lead to insatiable desires, and just one blow and they will lose their ground to exist. But to speak the truth, the Rightists have once played a positive role in the process of social progress. The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the cultural revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights. 3. For me, although I don’t fully agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I really care about his statements and respect Li Weidong; Because he is conscientious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China’s social problems seriously. But I oppose his anti-communist theory; I believe that unnecessary revolution should be opposed to; revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest and damage to people’s livelihood; political groups will be mixed, and foreign countries will avail themselves of the opportunity to get in. 4. Changing or improving China requires patience and the attitude to be responsible for the country and the people; those who try to make money from political opportunities are not Rightists, but bastards. Let’s talk about Leftists. Leftists, in fact, are a group of outcasts of the times and politics. If the Rightists are of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Rightists’ remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, the Leftists don’t have such luck, because what the Leftists want is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party! 5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the rebels and crazy Leftists at the same time, and they got really angry; I don't think it’s necessary at all. Don’t try to reason with rebels and crazy Leftists; they are all one track minded and unreasonable. Don’t try to prove we are right, and don’t even think about asking rebels and crazy Leftists to admit it; why bother? I told my friends: when the rebels call you a fifty-cent and when the leftist call you a rightist dog, they prove we are on the correct track in the middle! Many people had dreams when they were young, but they forgot about them when they got older; or, they pursue their dreams and become paranoid. They drift apart from their dreams and the young Dragon Slayer will eventually become a vicious dragon. I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom; the innate genes of China’s history and culture make China overall relatively left. The domestic Rightists are free and stress efficiency and development, while the Leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and safety. At present, society overall hopes to pay more attention to justice; at the same time, it is certain that when China and the United States fight, it is bound to lean towards left, which is estimated to continue for many years. Just like it if you don’t understand. No need to say more, Huahua is generous.
