In the past two years, the blockade and interception of the US on Huawei chips not only made Huawei fall into an unprecedented difficult position but also made “American” enterprises suffer from huge losses. The US suppresses China’s chips industry and required its own enterprises and relevant enterprises of its allies to block China’s chip industry at the same time; the direct consequence was that the number of orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in the decrease in the investment of research and development and production capacity of chip manufacturers, which further led to the disorder of chip supply chain shortages on a global scale. Today, “lack of chips” has affected all major industries of the world, resulting in the suspension of production of car enterprises and rise in prices of mobile phones; almost all the industries using chips are greatly impacted. To gain the right to make their own decisions on “chips”, more and more countries’ tech giants are taking the path of “de-Americanized”. In order to firmly holding the right to control global semiconductor in its hands and pin down the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the United States have made frequent moves recently such as hosting the “chip summit”, inviting the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocating funds to support the local technology giants in the United States; in order to regain its leading position in the chip industry, Intel, an old technology giant in the United States, spent $ 20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, US and opened its chip OEM business. When most people think Intel’s move will make certain impact on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and even steal their job. They are sure about it because Intel, as an old tech giant in the US, worked diligently in the semiconductor industry for dozens of years and have a large amount of talent teams and technological reserve; it is bound to rise within a short time and defeat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, sniffed at the decision of Intel. At the “2021 Master Think Tank Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising remark and spoke bluntly about Intel’s move to build a wafer factory, “it is rather ironic for Intel to build an OEM factory of chips”. Zhang Zhongmou disdained Intel’s decision to get into the wafer industry because Zhang Zhong still holds a grudge against a feud between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel more than 30 years. In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, occupying the leading position in the world; it was a king in the semiconductor industry in the world. Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been controlled by a few strong ones. At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode; chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by the same factory, and Intel was a representative of that era. However, such a model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only flinch in the face of huge production line construction costs. To respond to the calling of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation of chips industry began to appear; in 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established. Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou’s imagination became reality, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was created. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company aimed to set the single link of “processing of wafers” as its primary business; without design, only OEM services of wafer manufacturing was provided. The newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was only a small player in front of Intel the giant. In order to gain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once approached Intel for investment, but Intel was arrogant when it heard Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company only participated in the manufacturing of the chips industry; Intel looked down on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and resolutely refused to invest in it. Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel despised wafer manufacturing services at that time. Unexpectedly, the giant that looked down on wafer manufacturing services back in the days will also start to do wafer foundry now. Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is ironic for Intel to work on wafer foundry. The market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has surpassed that of Intel. Facing the powerful attack of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel naturally dares not to stand still. Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is trying to develop to the 3nm chips, and Intel still stays at the 14nm 7 years ago. It is actually not difficulty to surpass it.
