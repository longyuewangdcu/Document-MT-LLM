Let’s see some “strange trending topics” today. What is normal public opinion? Select three trending topics randomly, the rise of the head of the dragon on the 2nd of February, the price rise of ORLON, and the Huolala incident; the public opinion spread to form a peak, and then the [index declined] to form a (smooth curve) until it finally dissipated; if a secondary public opinion occurs, there will be a small hump again. They look no different from the [evolution model of online public opinion] once displayed on the official website of Cyberspace Administration. What is abnormal public opinion? Randomly select three trending topics from the same event, there are [solitary peak], [zigzag] and [cliff]. [Solidary peak] means the topic is artificially heated, quickly rushing to the trending topics list and attracting public attention; [Zigzag] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that topic stays on the trending topics list; [Cliff] means collective evacuation; after the topic has played its “function”, they received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield. In picture 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same; it must be because a unified batch of paid internet trolls have received the task and started a new round of offensive. The professionalism of black public relations can be seen: dozens of trending topics are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for explanation, which lead to argument and accumulate momentum, which divert attention, which affect understanding, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which coerce decision-making; the black production accounts work in batches and conduct segmented operations in different batches and time nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion. Communication is a science which disregards all subjective factors such as standpoint and emotion and only takes into account objective data; black public relations will have nowhere to hide. Traces will be left from anyone walked by, and we can dig out these traces together. Source of data: trending topics time machine.
