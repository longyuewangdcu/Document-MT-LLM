Is it reliable to buy insurance on the platform of Small Umbrella? Small Umbrella is an online platform of insurance brokers. In terms of the setting conditions: According to the prompt in Regulation on Insurance Brokerage Institutions (modified version in 2015), insurance brokerage companies shall meet three key words: shareholder, no major illegal record during the latest 3 years of the launcher, minimum amount of 50 million yuan, and approval by China Insurance Regulatory Commission. In fact, the three stipulations are rigorous, which can be summarized as being powerful, being approved by national authorities of the China Banking Regulatory Commission (the authority in charge of supervising all domestic insurance companies and banks), and good style of work of shareholders; as an insurance brokerage company, Small Umbrella Insurance is a regular company; after all, not all the insurance companies can achieve the 3 requirements. Therefore, it is trustful. In terms of the insurance products: The Small Umbrella Insurance is a supermarket of insurance products, and star products of many companies, i.e., the critical illness insurance, are sold on this platform; by taking the HTLIC Super Mario No. 5 critical illness insurance as an example, the compensation party and the insurer are both HTLIC, and Small Umbrella is just a third party intermediary agent, with no need to question its validity. In terms of payment mode: Because of no operating expenses of sales networks and salary for salesmen, internet products generally have high cost performance, flexible payment method including monthly payment, which reduces the payment pressure of policy holders; at the same time, it can lift the lever to the maximum extent. This is good. It can be taken into consideration. In terms of professionality of salesmen: This is the most important point; insurance is a industry with very strict requirement on professionality; however, customers can insure by themselves for many Internet products, leading to many wrong regions; with respect to health notification and occupation, non-insurance personnel often add their subjective awareness, and feel that they are healthy or they are in accordance with related stipulations, leading to many hazards in compensation, with risks of rejection. I used to work as a staff of insurance telemarketing for “Wesure” (a platform of internet insurance brokers, just like Small Umbrella), and I can tell you in a responsible way. Internet insurance is true and valid; however, some people say it not reliable because there is no professional practitioner for Internet sales channels, leading to many sales misleading. By taking some marketing strategies as examples, 1 yuan for insured amount of 6 million yuan, a free cell phone as a gift of buying insurance, free acquisition of the critical illness insurance of 60 thousand yuan, there is no mistake for such marketing strategies, but the provisions may avoid the important and dwell on the trivial and do not tell policy holders that 1 yuan is for the first month only, the normal expense will be charged from the second month, from dozens yuan to 200 yuan; a lot of customers don’t know it even after fee deduction of one or two years. They are misled to think they can acquire the compensation of 6 million yuan by spending only 1 yuan (fruit reaped without hard work). With respect to a free cell phone as a gift of buying insurance, it refers to only special guarantee slip number such as 6666 or 8888; in addition, there is no prompt about it after the message of winning is sent. The free acquisition of the critical illness insurance of 60 thousand yuan (another trap for policy holders) is a short-term activity; without other commercial insurance, 60 thousand can do nothing in front of critical illness, which solves no problem at all. Our country is cracking down misleading in Internet insurance sales at present. Therefore, generally speaking, there is no problem in platforms or products; but there are problems about the professionality and the professional integrity of salesmen. The owner of the topic is suggested to consider in a comprehensive and deliberate way, and many offline insurance brokerage companies have more varieties of products for customers to choose; some products have better cost performance than Internet products. I’ve helped 59 Internet customers insure with offline products, saving 2000-3000 yuan/year for every one of them in insurance premium. You are welcome to communicate and exchange with me if you have any question. I, an agent of Mingya Insurance Brokers, have provided services to nearly 1 thousand enterprise users with the experience of enterprise management training of 3 years, and have cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies; before insuring, I customize insurance products for customers according to their demands; when insuring, I make comparisons among different products, to strive for the best underwriting results for customers; after insuring, I arrange and entrust guarantee slips for customers so that they can buy insurance with no worries. Grow up together with each customer. I wish that my answer can help others. According to definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance refers to the insurance business that a policy holder can complete all the insuring process by himself after clicking the link of insuring. During this process, neither the policy holder nor the insurance consultant needs to sign his name, and all the procedures can be completed by the policy holder only. Although there is no “sense of ceremony” in insuring for Internet insurance, or even there is no printed paper contract, it leads to no influence on validity and force of law of the e-version contract. This mode is just assembly line work such as “telemarketing”; however, it may lead to a critical problem; i.e., there may be unfavorable follow-up services. Insurance is generally a long-term contract as long as dozens of years, and we need to consider if the “intermediary agent” we choose can provide us with services many years later?
