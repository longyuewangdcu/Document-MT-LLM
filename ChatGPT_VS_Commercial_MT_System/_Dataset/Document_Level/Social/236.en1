I always object to slander and abuse of any form, and I cannot accept any personal abuse. This is an inclusive civilized society, and we need to eliminate this kind of scoundrel. Regardless of political party and school, the first one to be rejected is the uncivilized style. Firstly, you sent the friend request on the Facebook, and then you published topics of scoffing, and then you tried publishing my home address and the name of my father on the social media, and I always adopted the attitude of no response. Later, you were further intensified to tag me with the frequency of at least six times a day; even more, you discussed some vague and humiliating speeches about me with your friends on Facebook, such as the appearance, the stature, being good at giving birth to and bringing up children, and some messages about molesting, I... I also let it pass. However, later, many of my friends sent your photo and your speeches about molesting on your Facebook. Sorry, as a girl, I could not still keep silent. However, after knowing that I called the police, you did not restrain yourself at all; instead, you were even more arrogant. I don’t care about your political background or your identity or status, gender respect is required in our society. Yes, you can continue your teasing, vague, humiliating and abusing speeches, and you can still tell that you just care about me or notice me, and you can think it not harassing, or you can even still deny that it is not your picture or you can still make all aggressive comments. Ok, I cannot and I have no ability to prevent you from doing so. I did not know you, and don’t want to know you in the future, and don’t find fault with my appearance and figure. I don’t think any girl is willing to ask others to humiliate herself to make her famous. My friends asked me if I was ok. They didn’t believe me although I told them that I was ok. I don’t think any girl would say she is ok after being bullied. No matter in work, society, political circles or commercial circles, only those people who have even no basic morality will hurt a girl in this way. I believe that justice naturally inhabits a man’s heart. I have some screenshots about part of the comments for you to make judgment. Nobody can pretend to be you since you posted it by yourself. I can only say that you are the public enemy of the civilization. A smile
