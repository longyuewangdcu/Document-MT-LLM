I have been against any form of insult or abuse since the beginning, and I will not stand such personal attacks. In this civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we need to get rid of these bullies. If you don’t look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized actions that should be boycotted first. I never replied to you since you started to send me Facebook friend request, published ridicule posts, and then tried to post the so-called location of my home and my father’s name on social media. After that, you made it worse by not only continuing to tag me six times a day, but also continuing to wantonly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, figure, shape fit for giving birth, getting love bites in bed, whether to penetrate or not, I... forget it. It was unexpected that more people sent me a photo uploaded to your Facebook friends page and your harassing comments. Sorry, I cannot be silent anymore as a girl. After the news of me calling the police was published, you did not restrain yourself at all, but became more arrogant. I don’t care about your political background or your identity or position; in our society, the two genders shall respect each other. Yes, you can continue with your ridicule, obscure, humiliating and abusive remarks; you can continue to say that you just care about and pay attention to me; you can continue to think that this is not harassment; you can even continue to deny that you made the pictures or continue to make all the offensive remarks. Yes, I can’t and won’t stop you. I don’t know you and I don’t want to know you, and my appearance and body don’t need you judgement. I don’t even think any girl would want to be famous by being humiliated like this. My friends asked me if I was okay. You won’t believe it if I say yes. I don’t think any girl could say they are okay after being bullied like this. No matter it’s in the workplace, society, politics or the business world, only those without basic moral character will harm a woman in this way. I believe justice is in everyone’s heart. I took screenshots of part of the comments and you can make your judgement. You posted it yourself, and no one will pretend to be you, right? I can only say you’re the enemy of civilization. Smile
