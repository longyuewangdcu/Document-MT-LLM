When talking about the crash of Meta by 26% and the market value evaporation of 25.1 billion USD, Zuckerberg replied 「facing with unprecedented competition」, then what is the reason for it? Meta (the original Facebook) is an advertising company in the essence, with main income from advertisement; the advertising company earning money today has its own flow source. Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., any functional localization is the flow source of Meta. More than that, Meta is the largest”advertising alliance”, and many Apps cooperate with Meta in advertising, and change it into money through the Meta advertising platform. However, time changes. Firstly, it is very difficult for Meta to acquire the data information due to the adjustment in the privacy policy of Apple, which gives rise to influences on efficiency of advertisement putting. The present privacy policy is friendly to users, and obvious prompt is provided about if the user allows the App to acquire his information, and most people choose no, of course. Next, if Google gives an attack, it will lead to greater influences on the income of Meta. Secondly, the Chinese factor is weakened in the income growth of Meta (there is actually the factor, although the specific ratio cannot be determined). As we all know, Meta has no business in China; but, we don’t understand it accurately. At least 10% of the income of Meta is from China, mainly contributed by companies engaged in sea services. The office of Meta in Hong Kong accommodates several hundreds of staffs, and it has several major agents in Chinese mainland. In order to expand overseas markets, Meta is a necessary advertising channel for China, and most expenditure is contributed to Meta. Interestingly, TT is one of the main competitors of Meta; however, Meta made a lot of money on TT several years ago. Various agents in China are helping TT put advertisement to Meta, and Meta enjoys favorable performance in Greater China. I’ve never researched on it lately, but I believe that it will never be better than before. The stage that Chinese companies burned money in large scale overseas has been finished. Thirdly, the progress in new flow channel expansion is not as good as expected. Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms including TT are not mastered by Meta. The biggest problem is not only drop in income but also lack of growth expectation. The capital market settles on not only income but also future expectation. Obviously, Meta does not have a favorable expectation. In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg tells something about the “metaverse”. Metaverse is actually one of the directions in the future; however, with a long realization period, this story is not sufficient to support the market value of Meta within the next two or three years. Therefore, the next two years shall be a tough period for Meta. Although Facebook is magnificent now, with yearly income of 100 billion to 200 billion USD, in fact, Facebook has very strong sense of crisis; it has no moat when compared with other Internet enterprises and high-tech companies. Although all its social contact software have relatively high daily activity and are mainstream ones, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc.; however, when facing with quick development of tiktok, Facebook is not confident enough, and it is a blinking of eye for tiktok to defeat it. The concept of metaverse has no hope of success within a short period; therefore, Facebook is very dangerous, and this is the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and keeps finding a new track; however, I don’t think he has chosen a correct track, but a road of no return; this is my idea for reference.
