What is the hottest thing in 2021? It was none other than the Tokyo Olympics. Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards? Recently, there is an article titled Look! An article titled Olympic Disciplines in Which Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals was viral, and it mentioned that project managers can be the foremost and unmatched in many disciplines, such as working arduously, going on business trips, and staying up late, the everyday work of project manager, and handling emergency, taking the blame and apologizing are nothing difficult at all. A seemingly joking article also tells the bitterness of their daily work, and the hidden message is their insufficient energy to handle the current project management work. People engaged in project management also gradually choose to get rid of the predicament in work by taking certain actions. Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants each year, increasing project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning. According to the 20-year Development Report on China’s Project Management (1999-2019), as of September 2019, the national PMP ® applicants totals 600,000, with 420,000 passed the PMP ® certification, and the number of valid certificate holders are about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of certificates of PMP ® in the world. In the past ten years, the number of people holding PMP certificates keeps increasing, which indicates that more and more project managers realize it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying “past experience”; the rapidly changing working environment tells us that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward. However, can you ensure the smooth proceeding of project management work after passing the PMP test? Many beginners of project management say that by learning courses of PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master knowledge points such as the ten fields and five major process groups of project management, but they are still confused when they are actually engaged in project management work. Many project managers often reflect the following problems: project management awareness is not sufficient, relying solely on personal experience, and there is only project management theories and no ideas about how to practice them; lack of support of systematic project management process and system, unable to actually implement the work, inaccurate project estimation, poor sensitivity of control, and project being delayed again and again; the members’ division of labor is not clear, there’s no way to handle the “sophisticated ones” in the team, communication is not smooth between departments, and it is difficult to push the project forward... Therefore, ZTCHINA, which has been focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D of management for more than ten years and helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of “China Enterprise R&D and Management Talents Training Demonstration Base”, presents the online course R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp.

This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results to enterprises with less cost and investment. That’s all my own introduction, and you may see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only a professional explanation of the course content in simple terms by the ZTCHINA expert team (former Huawei R&D management team), combining international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
