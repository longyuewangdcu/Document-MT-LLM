It is known as the supercar of the largest exhaust noise in the new mountainous area! This model of car we introduce now is the dream of many men! This model of car we introduce now is the dream of many men! With the high price of nearly 2 million Malaysian ringgit and yearly road tax of more than ten thousand Malaysian ringgit, it is a car of four-wheel drive; why is it called as LP700? Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast can it run? Well, of course, I do not know it; according to related data, it takes only 2.9s for the acceleration from 0 to 100km/h; when my myvi is just accelerated to 30km/h, it is accelerated to 100km/h, hum. The low car body, the arrogant scissor door, the huge air inlets distributed surrounding the car body and the 6.5 v12 engine which can be unobstructed under the glass perfectly explain the style of Lamborghini. I don’t need to tell so much about the car model, and you can Google it by yourself; I’ve collected some explanations that may not be acquired from Google! It attracts too much attention, which will make the car owner uneasy! (In fact, it’s cool) The car owner just needs to pay 1 yuan for gasoline for each 1km (the car owner doesn’t car it at all). The car owner needs to practice the gesture to get on and get off, or it will be a little awkward (because the car owner may not get out of the cab and will be blocked half). There is too much noise in the engine, and the car owner may get deaf after getting off. (But it’s also cool). Ordinary parking spot will be very narrow for the car due to the very large size, and it may be damaged when the door of the car parking next to it! The car owner may be lonely, because there is no competitor on the road (it’s my idea, unrelated to the car owner, ha-ha) Don’t misunderstand me, and the supercar in the video is not on sale, sorry!

It involves in a car accident of ten million yuan!

A few days ago, an accident destroyed the million yuan sports car 911 and the ten million yuan supercar Chiron within a few of minutes! According to the results, the high price is reasonable!
