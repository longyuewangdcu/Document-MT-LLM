As NFT went viral beyond its own circle, a new concept emerged in the encrypted community. In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity has exerted a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in this game. Axie Infinity is a pet grooming game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of playing methods including NFT, and it is the NFT project with the highest trading volume now, exceeding US $3 billion so far. Data of TokenTerminal shows that the daily income of Axie Infinity exceeds 8.2 million US dollars, approaching that of Honor of Kings. On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity said their daily active users have surpassed one million. The hotness of Axie Infinity has sent the new “palytoearn” pattern to more people; with the help of blockchain and intelligent contract, players are no longer a single character, and in addition to gaining pleasure and economic revenue from the game, they can also participate in the governance of game ecosystem. The subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but guaranteed by blockchain technology. I read a piece of news about one of my friends’ stock price, and my biggest feeling is the how the enterprise chooses its track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry; first of all, they should choose a industry with a large space for development and a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, we should choose industries with good growth in the future and consider the industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; finally, choose industries with policy support. The width of the track refers to the scale of market, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is easy or bumpy refers to the competitiveness landscape of the industry. Cheer for the right track! In the new year, the first task is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022. The key of the tactics is “do the things right”. The key of the strategy is “do the right thing”. Strategy lies in finding direction and tactics lies in implementation; above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking. For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), we can think about whether to continuously deepen the current field or expand the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can think about how to improve the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable. After coming into being 12 years ago, bitcoins ushered in several milestone events in 2021. On September 7, the small country, El Salvador, in Central America designated bitcoins as a legal tender, and this is the first time that bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region. On October 12, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States approved the launch of bitcoin ETF by ProShares company for the first time in eight years and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the landing of the first compliant bitcoin futures ETF in the US capital market and the expansion of cryptocurrency investment exposure. From the perspective of blockchain technology, bitcoin is not the leading role. On November 14, 2021, bitcoin carried out a soft bifurcation upgrade called Taproot, which improved the anonymity of bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.
