The biennale is planned jointly by Diriyah biennale foundation of Saudi Arabia and UCCA of China, and Tian Feiyu, curator of UCCA of China, works as the art director.
According to the introduction from the planning team, the theme of the biennale is “crossing the river by feeling the stones”, which is a metaphor of the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transition period and reflects the current situations of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The biennale occupies an area of nearly twelve thousand square meters, and the exhibition hall stretches across six connected buildings with six units: Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones, Inheritance as an Experiment, Thinking at the Edge, Walking to the Public, Beautiful New Word and On the Spirit of Arts.
In which the number of the works of the 27 artists from Saudi Arabia accounts for more than 40% of the total number of the exhibits, including various art forms such as drawing, installation art and performing art; the works of the 12 Chinese artists also attracted much attention, and some artists create with recycled materials in an innovative way; for example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with wastes in Behind the Story Series, Picture of Endless Streams and Mountains (2014).
According to Buckley, CEO of Diriyah biennale foundation, it is hoped that the biennale can establish an international dialogue, provide global audiences with opportunities to understand the vigorously developed culture industry and innovative communities in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interactions.
Tian Feiyu said, “The biennale has two objectives, i.e., establishing dialogue between contemporary art of Saudi Arabia and the world, and integrating audiences of Saudi Arabia into the contemporary art world.”
It is understood that there will be a series of lectures during the biennale, and artists, exhibition planners and leaders of innovative industries will engage in discussions on cross-cultural communication, contemporary art development and other topics.
