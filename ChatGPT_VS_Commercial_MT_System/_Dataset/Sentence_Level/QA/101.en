I work far away from home and today is my birthday. I turned off my phone, and I don’t want to let my friends know, but I don’t want to be neglected either. So I bought a cake for myself. Please give me some blessings you guys.
Haaaaaaaaaaaapy Birthday.
Thanks.
You’re welcome. Everyone being happy is the more important.
