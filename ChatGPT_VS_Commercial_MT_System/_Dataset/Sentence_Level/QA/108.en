What’s the difference between the CPU in whole package and that in bulk?
There is no differences. One is packaged and the other is not packaged. Those in bulk tend to have fake ones in it.
Does the original package have a radiator? Is it enough?
What about this setup? I want to play large games and I want to watch high-definition videos.
Normally it would do. It’s capable of playing large games. And as for the graphics card at the same price range I would suggest 7770 which is slightly better than 650.
Please recommend a setup which costs less than 3000 yuan.
Do you want a monitor?
Yes.

This setup cannot play large games with all the special effects on, but it’s OK to watch high-definition videos. I hope that my answer could help you.
I don’t want all the special effects on, I just want to keep it smoothly.
