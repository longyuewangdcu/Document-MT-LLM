My company requests the staff to have a car to continue to work, and they would give me 88 yuan for car subsidy. If you don’t have a car, you have to quit. What brands of cars do you have, please?
BYD F0.
That’s too expensive.
Jiangnan Alto, or buy a second hand one. Some second-hand Charade only sells for several thousand yuan. See if you dare to drive it!
My company requests to buy a brand-new car.

20 thousand and 8 hundred yuan.
It’s way too expensive. I only have 20 thousand yuan, and I need to save some for license plate and driver license.
