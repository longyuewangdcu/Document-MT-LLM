I have a question. There is a newly opened Internet café nearby and all of its computers are new. It’s totally smooth when playing Need for Speed 14 with all the special effects set to the highest. So the computer setup…
Perhaps it’s the storage thing.
I mean the system storage.
What is the system storage? Do you mean any hard drive or what?
Do you know the concept GB?
I know.
You would be an idiot if you don’t know.
The hard drive that stores the PC games has a capacity of 1024GB, is it the difference?
How can I download the Zhiji APP.
It doesn’t have an application, you can only use it through browser.
Oh.
