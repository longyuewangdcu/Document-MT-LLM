Where can I download 1080P HD movies? I don’t want the ones that need downloading via torrents, nor Thunder. They’re fucking too time-consuming.
Using Thunder could improve the download speed. The member privilege allows you to use the high speed downloading channel and the offline download, which is obviously faster.
Android system, and the speed test says the speed is up to hundreds of kb/s, but the actual speed by using the Thunder is only a few KB per second. Damn.
