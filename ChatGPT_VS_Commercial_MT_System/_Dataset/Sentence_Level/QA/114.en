My monitor screen always goes into black, what’s wrong with it? (the screen would turn to black 30 seconds after starting, and it would turn to black again after restarting).
The monitor’s VGA interface deteriorates.
Which interface is it? How to handle it?
Go to the repair service, and it would be troublesome to have it repaired.
The man who repairs computers said yes. The monitor. I’m speechless.
Yeah, it’s troublesome.
