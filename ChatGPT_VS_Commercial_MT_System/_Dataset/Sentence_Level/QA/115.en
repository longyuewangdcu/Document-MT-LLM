My monitor screen always goes into black, what’s wrong with it? (the screen would turn to black 30 seconds after starting, and it would turn to black again after restarting).
The cable behind your monitor isn't plugged in tightly!
They’re good.
The monitor screen went into black! Turn off the monitor power and turn it on again, and it would come back to normal temporarily, but it soon turns to black again.
Something is wrong with your monitor’s power cord, you can use your rice cooker cable to have a try.
Mine is a TV monitor.
It’s either the cord problem or the socket problem.
