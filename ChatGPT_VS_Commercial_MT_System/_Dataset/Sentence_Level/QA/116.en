My monitor screen always goes into black, whatâ€™s wrong with it? (the screen would turn to black 30 seconds after starting, and it would turn to black again after restarting).
Is there a problem with the transformer?
The monitor screen went into black! Turn off the monitor power and turn it on again, and it would come back to normal temporarily, but it soon turns to black again.
Something wrong with the cord?
What cord?
The one that connects the host to the monitor.
And.
