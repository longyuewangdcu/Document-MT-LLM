My monitor screen always goes into black, what’s wrong with it? (the screen would turn to black 30 seconds after starting, and it would turn to black again after restarting).
Is the monitor port connected well?
Yes, it is.
The monitor screen went into black! Turn off the monitor power and turn it on again, and it would come back to normal temporarily, but it soon turns to black again.
I suggest you change the monitor power cord and use your rice cooker’s cord to have a try.
Mine is a TV monitor.
As long as the voltage is OK. I don’t know that.
