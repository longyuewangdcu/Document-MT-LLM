The computer would not start when connected to the Seagate Backup Plus Portable Hard drive.
It’s easy. Connect the hard drive when you enter the Windows 7 system. Some portable storage devices have such kind of problem. It would start from the portable hard drive you plugged in directly while others would not.
I don’t want to plug in and out portable hard drive every time I turn on and off my computer. Usually, I would find that the portable hard drive is still connected when the computer is turned on, making the starting failed., and I must restart it again.
It cannot detect the hard drive.
You boot into BIOS and change the hard disk mode to IDE or compatible mode. Don’t use that ACHI thing.
You can also download a partition software called Diskgenius and copy it to your U Disk, and then run it under the PE mode, which would be fine.
Initially the Diskgenius diskman could detect the hard drive 7.9G but it couldn’t read the capacity.
7.9 G is the capacity of your Kingston U disk. Enter BIOS and change the hard drive’s mode to compatible mode or IDE. Otherwise, you can install it with a Windows 7 system or you can enter with Windows 7 PE and you would see the hard drive.
What is the video memory bit width of the graphics card that shares the video memory capacity?
You little kid, why must you check the video memory instead of checking the graphics card chip model? The one you use is a core graphics, the performance of which is weaker than a high-end discrete graphics card, even then the video memory is 15G.
Don’t make comments casually if you don’t know it exactly.
You actually don’t believe it? Whatever. You check the rank of this core graphics in the ladder diagram. And then take the video and bit width into consideration. The video memory now is only relative to resolution.
Bit width is generally relative to anti-aliasing. If you would rather believe that insane idea brought forward by JS, then don’t reply me anymore. For me, I pay attention to core graphics and stream processor when I decide whether the graphics card is good or not.
Video memory and bit width are ranked last.
