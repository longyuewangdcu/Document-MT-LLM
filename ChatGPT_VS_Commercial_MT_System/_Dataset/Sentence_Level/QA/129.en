What is the fastest reading and writing speed of the hard disk?
The average seek time of SSD solid state drive is 0.1 millisecond, while 5 millisecond for 15000 rpm hard drive and 7 millisecond for 10000 rpm hard drive.
Personal computer is equipped with 7200 rpm drive while the laptop is equipped with 5400 rpm drive. The reading and writing speed is basically the same, but the seek speed differs.
Could you be more specific?
Why is it so lagging with the FPS 50 only?
The CPU can’t catch up. Turn the resolution to 60 HZ before you enter the game, and set the contrast lower. Exit a program, enter the game, and reduce the bullet trace, weather and other attributes 
It became lagging these two days, and it was not lagging a few days ago. I went to the repair service today and they said nothing was wrong with the graphics card.
Graphics card is not the determining factor of the low FPS. CPU is the processor unit. And it would be lagging as well if the graphics card keeps up while the CPU doesn’t. So you can try the above method, and the FPS would be increased a lot. By the way, a low FPS hardly affects playing ak.
Why is it so lagging with the FPS 50 only?
Your internet speed is not good enough. I’ve come across that situation before. FPS 100 would not be a problem if the internet speed is good.
My internet speed is 6 MB/s, and the ping is 12 ms. It couldn’t be the internet speed’s problem.
