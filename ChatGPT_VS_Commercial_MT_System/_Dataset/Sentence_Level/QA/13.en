In the mid-February 2014 I had a traffic accident (the star of Chang’an scratches a Lexus, we were all well, it’s just that the car paint was scratched). And the traffic police has dealt with it.
Include the Saturday and Sunday, basically eight or nine days.
I’ve checked my account, and it’s been a month and I haven’t received my claim settlement. I called them and they just replied that it would be soon.
