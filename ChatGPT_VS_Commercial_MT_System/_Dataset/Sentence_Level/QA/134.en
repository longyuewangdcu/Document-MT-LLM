Where can I download the most original and free Microsoft Office Word 2003?
I couldn’t provide the website, but you could search for msdn itell you, and the original version means the paid version.
I mean, it doesn’t have to be the original version, I just want Microsoft Word 2003. So I want a free version, which could be used in school’s computers. The one I downloaded prompts that it couldn’t be installed.
