Portable drive data recovery software for free.
I’ll send you a super drive data recovery software called SuperRecovery. But if it is damaged physically, then I suppose any software couldn’t help.
You might need to ask a professional data recovery company for help. If the data was deleted by mistake, formatted accidentally, not written any data after afterwards, the software I recommended would help to recover the data.
I couldn’t do anything then if you said that. I’ll add you to my friend list, and I’m not sure if you would accept my request. Haha.
I’ve sent it already. How did it use?
It’s scanning and it would take four hours.
Haha, sorry to hear that.
I really appreciate it as all of my data have been recovered.
