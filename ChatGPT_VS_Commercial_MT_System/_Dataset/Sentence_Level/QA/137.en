How about this computer configuration? How big should the power supply be? Could anyone give tips?
It’s just ordinary. The graphics card is dragging. If you want to play the newest 3D games, I would suggest that the RAM at least be 8G, and the monitor be 1080P? As for your current setup, rated power 450W is enough.
What graphics cards should use? This is a recommendation list. I haven’t set my computer up yet. Thank you, guys.
760 or 660ti, and pay attention to power supply.
Is the price going to be around 300 yuan?
