The best art studio for CEE in Shanghai.
Why didn’t you go to Beijing?
I’m from Shanghai and now I’m in the eighth grade.
Are you in eighth grade or in the second year of senior high?
If you are in eighth grade, why do you consider it so early?
I’m in the eighth grade and it would be too late if I take those lessons when I’m in senior high.
Are you going to study in Beijing?
I want to study it in Shanghai and I still need to go to school.
