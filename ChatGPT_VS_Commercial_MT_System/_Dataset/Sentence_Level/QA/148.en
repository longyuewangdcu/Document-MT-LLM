Telecom Shanghai Bell RG2210-CA Fiber Optic MODEM, I want to seek for the administrator’s password to set the auto dial of the MODEM.
Wi-Fi, router’s network is not stable. I’ve always thought that there is something wrong with the router, and then I bought a new one, and the network was still unstable, but
You’d better to go to the network operators and it’s them that can solve your problems thoroughly.
It involves your router and network cable at home, and the server responsible for your area.
I turned to the network operator and he said if I can get the access to the internet, then is not within their jurisdiction, and they told me to turn to the router seller. I’ve tried several routers and the same thing happens.
Check the computer or router to see if you set some timers or not.
Probably not, I never set timers.
Has anyone else touched your devices?
Nope, and I just called 10000 and they detected and said that my network is good.
