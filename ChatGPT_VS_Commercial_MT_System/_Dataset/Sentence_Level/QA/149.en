Wi-Fi, router’s network is not stable. I’ve always thought that there is something wrong with the router, and then I bought a new one, and the network was still unstable, but
It’s problem the cable thing, call the network operator.
This is broadband upgraded optic fiber, there is nothing to enter when setting it, connect it directly and then I can access the internet.
Broadband upgraded optic fiber? Enter the router interface and find the settings, select the static IP and fill in the IP that your network operator gave you.
They never gave me anything like that, they just set the things done and then left.
