The Swarovski sold at Jingdong Mall sales at over 700 yuan, are they real? Is it guaranteed to buy thing from Jingdong Mall?
They are merely rocks. I can only say that the quality products of Jingdong mall are more than that of Taobao.
I want to buy a birthday gift for my sister, with a budget under 1000 yuan, any good recommendations? Something like necklace, bracelets and pendants.
The gold price goes down, you can buy a gold pendent. Go to the mall and buy one, it’s stylish.
It’s cheap even the prices goes down.
It’s not cheap.
