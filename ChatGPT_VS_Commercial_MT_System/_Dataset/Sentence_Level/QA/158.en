The initiating speed of Office Excel is slow, what can I do with it?
Reinstall the system, or it’s the file being too big issue.
The system and the software are new, and the hard drive is SSD, of which the speed is enough. But I don’t understand why it works after banning the Print Spooler.
How to solve it that I can’t access the Local Disk E.
It’s a permission issue. You use the super user to enter the disk permission to modify.
I’m the administrator. And it remains the same after modifying the permissions.
It’s already been solved. I’ll give you more points.
