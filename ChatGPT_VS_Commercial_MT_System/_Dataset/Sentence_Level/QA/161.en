The router has cut off. You turn off the router and plug off the network cable and connect it to the computer, and try to dial to see if it can access the internet. If you can, then it would be a problem of the router. Cut off the supply power of the router and turn it on again, restart the network, and there would be no problem. The router is consistently offline, it’s the quality issue. It’s stable. I’ve been using it for years and it only cuts off once. I used the Xunjie router at home, it costs more expensive. Try it according my instructions and I hope that it would help.
Mine too. It constantly cuts off. Such things never happened before.
I ran into such situation before. So I recommend you to try it with my instructions to see if it can access the internet with routers. If not, it’s the network operator’s problem rather than the router’s issue. You must try first to know that.
