Why can’t my computer connect to the router? It couldn’t process at the step of automatically obtaining IP address. It can’t obtain it automatically. And the system is Windows 7.
Are you sure that you didn’t plug in the wrong cable? Did you plug the MODEM cable into the router?
I’ll try to change it, thanks.
Let me put it this way, you don’t have to plug the MODEM cable. Once you connect the router, and the router is on, then it can obtain the IP address automatically. You should follow the instructions to plug in the cable well, and then reset the router to fix the problem. Remember, you have to plug in the right cable.
