Why can’t my computer connect to the router? It couldn’t process at the step of automatically obtaining IP address. It can’t obtain it automatically. And the system is Windows 7.
Reset the password, or you can re-plug the cable on the router.
Could it be that the router is broken? I took it to a friend’s house and it didn’t work, either.
Check the instructions first to see if you plug in the cables correctly.
Okay, I’ll try again, and I’ll consult you if I’m stuck, thanks.
You’re welcome, my pleasure.
