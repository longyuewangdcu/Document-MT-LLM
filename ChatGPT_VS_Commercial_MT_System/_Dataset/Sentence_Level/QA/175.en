The newly purchased hard drive is a Seagate hard drive with SATA 3 7 200 rpm. How to connect it.
6 G / S means SATA3 interface, 3 G / S means SATA2 interface is used to set up IDE interface (many interfaces are missing on the new motherboard) and raid (matrix).
You mean the default then. The motherboard comes with two black 6G/s data cables, one L-shaped and one in-line. There is also a red one in the hard drive. Which one do I use?
