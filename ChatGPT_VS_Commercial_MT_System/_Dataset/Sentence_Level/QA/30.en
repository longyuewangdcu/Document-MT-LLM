I want to buy a car with price level at 1 million yuan. What car should I get? Please help me figure it out.
Benz ML 350
How much is it?
Less than 1 million yuan.
Does it feel comfortable to drive? What about the performance and configuration?
Not bad. You can alternatively choose X5.
Thanks.
Which one is better, Touareg or Benz ML 350?
How can you compare Volkswagen with Benz?
But many comments spoke highly of Touareg.
Benz ML 350 is a popular buy.
The more you buy, the higher the performance/cost ratio is.
Is it better than Range Rover?
The gas consuming of Range Rover is much the same as Hummer.
What do you say?
I’ve no idea and that’s why I asked you.
Actually, I feel like Land Rover is not bad, it’s pretty.
Isn’t Range Rover good?
