My last name is Shang. Please help me with a name for my daughter, which is snappier, catchy and meaningful. I’m anxious, thank you.
Lingxi Shang.
Zimei Shang.
Yeming Shang.
Thank you beauty. I’m sorry but I still don’t find the right one.
Okay, I’m just a senior high student, I can’t come up with something catchy, hah.
Never mind. But if you see or hear any beautiful names, you can send them to me, thanks.
