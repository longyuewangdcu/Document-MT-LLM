I posted a tweet saying that my waist is not comfortable. And that girl commented it like you’ve done too much bad things. Damn it, I was so wronged. I was preparing to make a pass at her. Do I still have any chances? What did she mean?
Hah, you definite have chances. She even commented voluntarily! As a girl’s mindset, generally she was sounding out your response. And if you admitted it, she would definitely be upset.
Really?
Absolutely! If she doesn’t have feelings for you, why didn’t she comment your post voluntarily! She was tying to find a topic. Before you are officially dating, bantering and flirting are the most common thing.
