I posted a tweet saying that my waist is not comfortable. And that girl commented it like you’ve done too much bad things. Damn it, I was so wronged. I was preparing to make a pass at her. Do I still have any chances? What did she mean?
She was joking with you and at least it demonstrated that you are closer in her eyes. You are easy to get along with each other. Go ahead and you may succeed.
I’ve already asked her out.
How do you make a move at her?
