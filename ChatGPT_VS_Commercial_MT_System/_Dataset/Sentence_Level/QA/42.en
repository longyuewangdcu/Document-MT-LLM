I posted a tweet saying that my waist is not comfortable. And that girl commented it like you’ve done too much bad things. Damn it, I was so wronged. I was preparing to make a pass at her. Do I still have any chances? What did she mean?
You’re definitely in. Go ahead and wish you happiness.
We’ve known each other for two months. How can I make a move at her?
Did you tell her how you felt?
Nope.
Previously she told me to help her raise her dog.
Is she single?
Yeah.
She has broken up for 1 month.
You should ask her out and tell her how you feel, don’t call her or text her.
Are my odds of success big?
Do you fear that you can’t even be friends if you couldn’t be together?
Yeah, decency and dignity matter as well.
I don’t feel like to keep it going with her. I’m just about to ask her twice and then I’ll be gone.
Just say it out loud if you really have a crush on her. Feeling regretful for something you’ve done is more acceptable than feeling remorseful for something you didn’t do.
There are a couple of guys are asking her out and she says that it is the feeling that counts. And she said to me that she liked bad guy, but not too much.
Bad has several meanings.
What did she mean?
Actually she meant that she wanted the one who is courageous and capable of protecting her, making her feel safe.
She just broke up with her ex, I don’t think asking her out at this specific moment is a good idea.
You can tell her that you have the feeling for her and you’ve noticed her for a while, and you just heard about the breaking up thing and you don’t think it’s the right timing to tell her how you feel.
But you’ve been thinking about her all the time, so please think of it. You must be very serious, and it all depends on how much she recovers from the last relationship.
Recover? She’s still been in the heartbreaking stage.
It all depends on the individual. For some people, they are in need of comfort and care in this situation.
She is the wo-man type.
Her boyfriend went into jail.
