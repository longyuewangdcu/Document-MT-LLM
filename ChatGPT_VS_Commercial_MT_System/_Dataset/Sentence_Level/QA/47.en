What exactly should I do?
Does the MCU External Interrupt contradict with the Timer? Please help me with the program. External Interruption might cause the Timer stop to work or not to be interrupted anymore. 
Firstly, your Timer 1 mode is switched to 0 (13 digits counter). Only if you use a external crystal with low frequency, otherwise the time precision of the timer is not second-level.
Then, you didn’t post the position where the time run label was revised. If you suspect that Timer 1 didn’t work continuously, you could remove the if condition (time run == 1), 
and see if the Nixie displays changing value. By the way, the statement of the Timer() interruption is low-efficient, and it’s not a healthy interruption service function.
The interruption service function needs to be succinct.
Second, I’ve tried to remove the time run, but the same problem occurs.
Third, I’ve tried to transfer the content of the timer() function to another one, and then I put a=1 into the timer().
Add if(a==1) to the main function (where I run the function mentioned above).
At the first line of the function I write a=0, which attempts to shrink the interruption server program, but it couldn’t run. As for the infrared remote control part, I don’t know much about that as I just copy it for the time sake. I’m not good at it either.
