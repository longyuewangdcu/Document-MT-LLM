Computer configuration.
My configuration can run GTA4 smoothly. FPS. Something wrong with the hardware. And the drivers are critical too. E5500 CPU, dual core, two threads. 4G RAM. GTS450 is definitely OK to play large games.
Running a game doesn’t need too much of CPU, but it indeed requires much of graphics card, RAM and hard disk.
I’ve seen some reviews saying that GTA4 needs on much of CPU and RAM.
As to the graphics card GTS450, I prefer the Galaxy production. As far as I know, this graphic card came into production in 2011 and now they don’t produce it anymore, and those on sale are basically refurbished.
In this case, is it capable of running GTA4 with medium and high special effects smoothly or perfectly?
