How can I root Galaxy GT-I9128E? I’ve tried several ways and none of them worked.
Perhaps it doesn’t have enough RAM. You can try instant rooting developed by Baidu.
It didn’t work. I initially used that instant rooting.
Then it is the lack of RAM. Try to change for a bigger SD car.
Is 8G not enough?
And that would your phone’s problem.
I have many phones that don’t work, because the cracker hasn’t been developed. And what I’m asking is which software develops the cracker of 9128e. Zip it up if you don’t understand.
