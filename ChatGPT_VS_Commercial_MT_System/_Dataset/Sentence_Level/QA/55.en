My eyeballs are always close to the upper eyelids. It is the downward three white eyes? Any disadvantages?
You look pretty. You are near-sighted. I’ve been focusing on this issue for a while. I’m myopic as well.
But some myopic people’s eyeballs are not like that. Do your parents have the same feature?
No, they don’t. But they both are of double eyelid, and it is just me that eyeballs close to the up.
