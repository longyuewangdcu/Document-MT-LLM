I entered confirmation code and was prompted that confirmation failed when I signed up for WeChat. What’s going on?
You can log in with your QQ account.
I don’t have one, I don’t know how to apply for it.
Go and apply for it.
It’s about my own business and it’s either sitting in the office all day while having a cup of tea, looking through the internet, watching movies and making phone call to contact business, or driving everywhere to contact business,
the latter is much better than the former.
But it costs a lot. I’ve already owed 400 thousand yuan and the interest is huge.
You must give to retrieve. Could phone calls get the business done? You didn’t show much sincerity.
Sounds reasonable.
