It lags when I play the League of Legends. Is it because that my graphics card is shit. At first my graphics card has over 500 megabytes.
The graphics card is too old, and I suggest you change one for playing the League of legends.
Yeah, that computer repair guy was a son of bitch. He charged me for 100 yuan and the graphics card is second-hand. I’ll change the graphics card for a better one. Will it lag too?
It won’t lag if you change it with a better graphics card. It’s unlikely that your whole setup is not good. Changing your graphics card is relatively better.
Okay.
