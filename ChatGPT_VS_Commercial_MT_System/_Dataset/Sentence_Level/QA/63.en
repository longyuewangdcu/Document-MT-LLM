Why the web page is blank when I open the website with my phone’s browser? Why did it continuously happen?
Try to use another browser.
Others don’t work either.
Why did it display like that when I opened it?
It has got a virus.
Ah, what should I do then?
Otherwise, it might be the computer host’s problem.
I’ve no idea.
Call someone to repair it.
