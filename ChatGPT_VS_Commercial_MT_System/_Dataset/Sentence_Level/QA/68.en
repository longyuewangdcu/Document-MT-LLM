Please recommend pretty and stylish desktop, a small one which can displays the system well. 
Desktop?
Sweetie, do you want computer desktop or mobile phone desktop? I’ll send you some selected stylish mobile phone desktops if you want them.
If you want mobile phone desktop, you could download the 91 Desktop. I think it’s a pretty good software.
It’s for mobile phone, and I want a smaller one to contain the system well, which can display the icons in a small way. Thanks.
What is the size of your mobile phone's screen?
System version is 4.1.2 and the screen size is 4.0 inches.
