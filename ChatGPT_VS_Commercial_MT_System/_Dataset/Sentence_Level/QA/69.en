Is there a software that can completely change the background wall of a photo?
Try Meitu Pic.
Nope, it can only add mosaic.
What about Baidu Motu?
No, they can’t.
There is an English application, but I don’t remember the exact name of it. Try Photoshop Express.
It’s all in English. I don’t understand it at all.
There is nothing I can do about it then. That’s the most professional one.
Hah, thanks.
You’re welcome. But I didn’t solve your problem.

Photoshop.
Can I change it with my phone?
Check out if there is the version for mobile phones.
There is, but it’s all in English.
Then I can do nothing about that. You can only try it yourself, or you can try it on your computer and then use it on your mobile phone when you figure it out.
Oh.
