Why other cannot see me while I can see them when I check the people nearby with my iPhone 4S? Please help me. I’ve already turned on location service.
Try to restart it.
I’ve tried it for dozens of times.
As for WeChat, remove it and then install the latest version. The system is different and the software information upgrades slowly. You might as well wait for a day to try it again.
Who can tell me what’s going on with my tablet? The Wi-Fi signal is full but the tablet couldn’t get the access to the internet. I’ve tried it on other devices and they all worked.
Check the Wi-Fi settings and see that it’s the automatic IP mode or DHCP mode. And make it on the DHCP mode.
It’s already on the DHCP mode, but it doesn’t work still. And the signal is not always full right now. What’s the matter?

Try to restart it. Or you can place it near the Wi-Fi. If it doesn’t work either, try to root it.
I just rooted it today.
I tried it for another time, and the signal was full, but it still couldn’t work.
Now the Wi-Fi signal is diminishing. What’s going on?
You set the router up again, namely reset it, and let it re-transmit the Wi-Fi signal.
Would it work?
Sometimes it’s the router’s problem, but for most of the time it isn’t. But you can just make every possible effort, what do you say? Try to connect other’s Wi-Fi and see if it works.
