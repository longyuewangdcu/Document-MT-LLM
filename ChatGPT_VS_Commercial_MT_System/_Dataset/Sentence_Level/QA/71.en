Who can tell me what’s going on with my tablet? The Wi-Fi signal is full but the tablet couldn’t get the access to the internet. I’ve tried it on other devices and they all worked.
Can’t get access to the router webpage via browser, Because other devices do work. I’ve been using another Vido for a while. Replying.
I’m using Vido N80 and never come across such kind of problem. If you can connect to the Wi-Fi, then restart it and see what happens? Is N12 single-cored or?
Single core. I’m replying you with the Vido Mini One.
Someone already told me to restart it, but it didn’t work.
I checked the configuration of N12, and the hardware is lame. Many games couldn’t run on it like my Teclast A10T. Hardware equipped with android upgrades fast.
The hardware upgrades, the software follows. And then the weak hardware is not compatible with the new software. And your device could only be used as a MP3 player.
I’ve been using it for 2 years. And it’s the emotion thing, and I’m not willing to let it die.
There’s no way then, throw it away. Its hardware is too weak. But some games might run on it. Vido is relatively bad, and I suggest you buy other devices.
Okay, I’ll just leave it here. I still got a Mini One.
You’d better buy the latest version of tablet. The android hardware is not supposed to upgrade frequently. And these upgrades won’t necessarily lead to the software upgrades. So you’d better buy an 8-cored tablet, which can be used for a long time.
