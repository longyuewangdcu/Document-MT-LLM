I came across this after installing Office Power Point 2007, and what should I do?
Double click that icon and open it.
Double click it and then it doesn’t make any response.
Check the start menu first to see if there is Power Point 2007.
No.
Install the Office 2007 again and it will be there.
I’ve made it to the desktop step, and should I unzip it or something?
What APP did you use to install it? Could you make a screen shot and show it to me?
I download it from a website.
I didn’t find it on Easy Mule.
