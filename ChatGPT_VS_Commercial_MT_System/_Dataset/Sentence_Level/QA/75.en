The computer originally was installed with Windows 8 system and I want to change it to Windows 7 and this pops out. Anyone knows how to handle it?
The formats of Windows 8 and Windows 7 are different. You need to format and repartition it, and try to install it again.
Please tell me in detail.
Which way did you use to install the system?
I tried to install it via compact disc or U disk.
Installation failed.
Did you install it successively?
It doesn’t have a system.
It doesn’t have a system temporarily.
How did you enter it if you didn’t install it?
