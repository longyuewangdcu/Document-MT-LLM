The cabbage offered by school has a taste of strong alcohol, and I only ate a small piece of it. Am I gonna be OK? 
Don’t worry, the school would take the responsibility for that if there was a problem with the food. So you just ate a small piece of it, and it’s gonna be fine.
It tastes like narcotic, and do you know what’s going on?
