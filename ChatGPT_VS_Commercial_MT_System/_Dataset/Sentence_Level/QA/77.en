I want to buy a bare-machine iPhone 4S of the China Telecom version, and where should I go to get the biggest bargain while it’s guaranteed to be genuine?
The contract phone of China Telecom, it’s the cheapest.
I just want a bare machine as the contract phone has got a authorization limit. 
If you want to get the official version with the biggest bargain, the contract phone would be the best choice. The China Telecom has already calculated the bills and spread them to your daily expense, which would make you spend more money on it.
But it has authorization limits.
Then you can go to the physical store. The price may not be the lowest. Shopping online wouldn’t guarantee it to be genuine. Risks do exist. When you get the phone you can check the usage history according to the serial number.
