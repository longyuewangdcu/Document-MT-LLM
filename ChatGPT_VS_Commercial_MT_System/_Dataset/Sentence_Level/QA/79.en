Can I buy the CD-KEY with my tickets which were topped up into Kong.net?
Does it need activation code already?
I mean the Open Beta CD-Key which is on sale on April 1st.
The computer screen is black when I start it and restarting it didn’t work.
Did the monitor show any response when the computer is turned on? Is the host powered on?
It’s prompted that the Windows system is upgrading.
What computer should I buy?
What are you gonna do with your computer?
For video games.
What video games do you want to play? You can pick a computer according to the officially recommended configuration.
