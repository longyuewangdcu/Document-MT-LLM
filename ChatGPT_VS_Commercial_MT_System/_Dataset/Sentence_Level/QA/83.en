A cable TV cable and a red and white audio cable were buried during the renovation. And what comes out of the set-top box is one red, one white, and one yellow line. So one yellow line is missing. Can I take the cable TV line and connect it to the yellow head?
Connect the line and the contact point well.
Do you mean the line would work if connected to the contact point well?
Well, as long as the lines are of the same type, the color of the lines is for you to accurately link the two ends.
They’re not the same type. It’s an old cable TV line. What I was asking is that can it be used as the yellow line of the AV tricolor line?
Yes.
