Why there is no movements with the WAN?
The network cable doesn’t plug in well or the account or the password is wrong.
Why could it receive the Wi-Fi signal then? But my phone couldn’t access the internet.
Your phone can find out the signal if the router is powered.
If the WAN works, the computer could access the internet. And if the LAN works, the phone could access the internet.
