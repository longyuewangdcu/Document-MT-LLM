My iPhone 4 has breakjailed, and why can’t it install themes after downloading them?
Breakjail causes some problems.
How to fix that problem?
Reinstall the iOS.
MY computer couldn’t access the internet. And it gives a prompt like that, and it has been for hours.
First, there are some arrears.
Second, unbinding it would do.
There are no arrears, and what do you mean by unbinding it?
And the password is wrong.
Can’t be the problem of password or arrears. You can call the local business hall.
I called and no one answered.
Call them tomorrow as they are off work at the moment.
Tell them that there are no arrears and the password is correct, and you need them to unbind it.
Okay, I’ll try.
