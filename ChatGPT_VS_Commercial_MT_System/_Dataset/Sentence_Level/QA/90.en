MY computer couldn’t access the internet. And it gives a prompt like that, and it has been for hours.
It’s so troublesome as I can’t see it clearly.
The same to my phone.
I can see it clearly on my computer.
Er, the computer can’t access the internet, I’ll use someone’s computer to check it later.
Maybe there is an operation in the background of my mobile phone
