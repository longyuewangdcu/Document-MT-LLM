Is there any APP on the phone to crack a Wi-Fi? How to do it?
There is an APP called Unlock, which is good.
Crack the Wi-Fi? Have you tested yourself?
Last October, my mom was hit by a car, and then she called the police. When she went to mediate, the other one had already taken a large bunch of agreements waiting outside the door, and I didn’t think much.
They said sue them directly.
Thanks, but will the court accept it without the accident certificate?
Is the traffic police present?
The traffic police was present, and there were transcripts. Or there are insiders in the traffic police station.
A lawyer would help you, sue them.
Yes, and I also went to the incident handling squadron. But the traffic police said that he can only give the agreement back, and he won’t give me the accident certificate.
Sue them, and then traffic police have to be involved, kick the ball back to the traffic police.
Thanks.
