I’ve already added a bank card into Ali Pay and the seller on Taobao said the refund would be transferred into the Alipay. I wonder what is the difference when compared with transferring into a bank card?
Why did I apply for a refund using Alipay and the refund go into the bank? Click the goods purchased and the records indicate that there was a refund initiated and the transfer was successful. Please help me out with it.
There would not be a message if you haven’t bind it to your phone.
I’ve already bound it.
You can check the purchase history and see what the status is. Is it refunding or refund successful?
I mean, when the refund was completed, the Alipay prompts that a refund has been transferred but the balance is still 0.
What method did you use to pay it, Alipay or a bank card?
I paid it with a bank card and the seller said the refund would be transferred into Alipay.
The seller didn’t know you pay the bill with a bank card, generally it would be processed with Alipay, so that’s why he said that. And I’m assured that the refund is in your bank card.
But a transfer to the bank card might take some time, which is less than one day, as I’ve come across such things before.
