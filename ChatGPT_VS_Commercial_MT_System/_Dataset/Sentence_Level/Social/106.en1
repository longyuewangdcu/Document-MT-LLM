In September 2020, Mr. Lu understood a plant in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a property agency, and Mr. Lu decided to purchase the plant after looking at it for many times.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a relative of the owner of the plant about the details of purchase, and made the payment of 200 thousand yuan through bank transfer on the same day as the deposit.
Lin signed the name on the Receipt of the Deposit of Plant Purchase as the receiver, and it noted, “If the buyer does not want to purchase the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the buyer in double, and both parties agreed to sign the Sales Contract of the Plant within 1 week. ”
However, both failed to reach agreement on main contract clauses such as plant ranges and mode of payment, and both parties did not sign on the sales contract.
Considering that both parties did not reach agreement on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200 thousand yuan to Mr. Lu several days later.
Considering that both parties did not reach agreement on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200 thousand yuan to Mr. Lu several days later.
For this reason, Mr. Lu initiated legal proceedings to Yuyao People’s Court.
After hearing, the court decided that both parties did not sign on the official contract, and it should be reasonably presumed as failure in negotiation; for this reason, the case was not applicable to fine of deposit, and the defendant should not undertake the responsibility for breach of contract of repaying the deposit in double.
The plaintiff appealed after receiving the first instance judgment.
The court of second instance has upheld the original judgment recently.
[Reminding by lawyers] The obligation of necessary prudence shall be fulfilled during the transaction process.
When signing a contract, the buyer shall fulfill the obligation of necessary prudence; for example, verifying the information of the owner of the house, verifying if the house is occupied by others; in addition, the specific time and location for delivery shall be noted clearly in the contract, to avoid dispute arising from contract performance between both parties.
