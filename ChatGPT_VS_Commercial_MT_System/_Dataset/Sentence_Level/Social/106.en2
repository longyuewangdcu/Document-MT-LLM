In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a plant located at Yuyao Zhangting Village in Zhejiang through an estate agent and decided to purchase it after seeing it on-site for a few times.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a family member of the house owner, about the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the Receipt of the Deposit for the Purchase and Sale of the Plant, which stated that if the buyer does not to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double; both parties agree to sign the plant purchase and sale contract within one week. ”
However, both parties failed to reach an agreement on the main items in the contract including the scope of the sale of the plant and method of payment, and as a result, they were delaying the signing of the plant purchase and sale contract.
Considering they have not reached an agreement on the content of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 to Mr. Lu a few days later.
Mr. Lu was helpless and angry because he had a hard time finding the plant, paid the deposit, prepared the payment and was waiting for the contract to be signed, but the seller didn’t want to sell it anymore.
For this, Mr. Lu decided to sue Lin at the Yuyao People’s Court.
After the hearing, the court held that the two parties failing to sign a formal contract could not be attributed only to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed; therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of contract and return twice the deposit.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff appealed again.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Reminder from attorney] In the process of trading, we should perform necessary duty of prudence.
When signing the contract, the buyer should perform necessary duty of prudence, such as verifying the information of the house owner and whether the house is occupied, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
