You are Zheng Mian, and this was the second week that you move to Japan.
You were walking in a street, and somebody was following you; you were so afraid that you walked more and more quickly, and finally, you even ran.
That man chased after you: “Miss! Please wait! ” (Japanese dialogue in Japanese) You stopped at the door of a convenience store.
“Miss...... I’m a film director, and you are so beautiful, are you interested in participating in a reality show? ”
You doubted if it was a fraud.
He delivered you a piece of business card, and you found he really a director of a large-scale entertainment company in Japan.
“If you have time, we can have a talk in our company, and you will be provided with considerable remuneration. ”
You were confused but followed him to the company, and he said that he liked you at the first glance, and wished that you could participate in the reality show.
Thinking that there was no loss but you can earn money, you signed on the contract.
That was a large-scale reality show about love affairs, and was divided into two parts.
In the earlier stage, celebrities and average people will get along with each other in real life, to cultivate tacit understanding.
In the later stage, they will play a game and work together to make breakthroughs.
The reality show will be recorded in the next week, and you don’t know your partner and what interesting things will happen.
