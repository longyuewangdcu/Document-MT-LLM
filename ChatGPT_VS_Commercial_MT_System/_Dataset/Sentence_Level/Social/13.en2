I will say my conclusion first; I think Only Fools Rush In is utterly a terrible film in any sense.
But it is not without any highlight; at least the music is good.
There are many types of terrible films; some make you sleep soundly in the cinema, some make you angry after watching it; Only Fools Rush In is like monkeys on Mount Emei; it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is super talented in insulting the audience.
The most painful part of the film is that it is hard to describe like a monster in Cthulhu novels, and has as many loopholes as the holes on the trench coat on Javier Mascherano.
After watching it, you may even wonder if there is metaphors the director planted in it; but you will find that it is only a piece of shit after close examination.
I’ll first briefly talk about some plots that are hard to understand.
The male leading role lives with his grandma on some island in the south.
His grandma has a wish, watching the snow, and the a old male neighbor drove a minibus to take her to watch the snow in the Northeast.
An elderly goes to watch the snow in the northeast from the south in a minibus? ?
He and his father were okay with it.
And then there is no follow-up on this old lady.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship; how does the brother of the female leading role get the license?
How do the racing bike gang on the island easily block a mountain road? ?
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road just stopped at the roadside, and the truck driver was nowhere to be found.
They are obviously props.
Why could a little gangster biker with poor credit and who was suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary policeman?
Why didn’t he call the police when there was usury involved, and the police specifically asked if there was any problem.
An adult who knows how to use smart phone doesn’t know how to use the card to open the door at the hotel, and it was forcefully arranged for him not being able to find the owner of the hotel and so he slept outside the hotel for the night?
Such ridiculous plots were everywhere in the film; the plots are so ridiculous that I feel painful when I remember them.
In addition to the plots, the theme of the film is even more terrible, or you can say there is no theme in the film; it’s just a horrible monster that is stitched together.
In the beginning of the film, you may think he wants to make a comedy; after twenty minutes, you may guess it’s an inspiration film; after a half of it, you may think it’s a drama showcasing the hardship of a small town boy; after you watch all of it, you don’t even know what you have watched; what follows is deep doubt in yourself; why would you go to the cinema to watch a piece of shit during the Spring Festival?
Most people are familiar with the routines of various films; for example, if you want to make a film about a biker, then make it an inspiration + comedy to tell the audience how a talented rookie achieves success step by step.
If you want to make a love film, just tell the story about a small town boy who loves to ride motorcycle and a girl who works as a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, then the plot should not have anything that is contradictory to the normal world.
(Such as the character played by Yin Zheng who sang after his new motorcycle was just burned ) please don’t think about ideas that are ridiculous.
As for why the female leading role acts like a five-year-old child when she is not retarded at all, I really don’t know if there is problem with her acting or it was demanded by the director.
And one more thing I don’t understand is why Han Han as a racer is so keen on adding the plot of car crash in his films?
Is such a film being arranged in the Spring Festival season to humiliate the audience?
