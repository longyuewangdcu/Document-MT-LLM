I’ve read the following article by chance which discusses on why customers require logistics companies in the bonded area to provide canning services on the perspective of commerce and storage period, although canning is a kind of deep processing, not belonging to the operation scope of logistics companies; the article can explain why customers want them to do so.
I’ve contacted various production lines of milk powder in many manufacturers.
In fact, bagged milk powder and canned milk powder have the same raw materials, with totally no difference.
Then some people may ask: why the expiration date for bagged milk powder is one year, and that for canned milk powder is two years or even longer?
Or: what is the reason of such large difference in price between bagged milk powder and canned milk powder?
Many consumers or mothers of infants think there are differences in raw materials, and canned milk powder has much better quality.
In fact, the raw materials of the two types are totally the same; however, people think expensive products are better.
Because of this idea, some consumers even say that canned milk powder tastes better!
Then I’ll tell you the reason for the high price of canned milk powder.
What is the reason for such big difference in price since they have totally the same raw materials?
When pricing for products, most manufacturers consider that it is difficult for consumers to accept bagged products with high price, which means low profit or even no profit for manufacturers; then how do manufacturers to survive?
Therefore, they set a much higher price for canned products, so as to ensure their profit space.
For this reason, most manufacturers popularize canned products but not bagged ones.
In addition, the advertising expense for each year is generally dozens of million yuan or even hundreds of million yuan, then where do they get the money?
You can imagine.
With the development of the society, there are increasingly grown expenses in market promoting, such as the expenses for promoters in shopping malls, the expenses for display in shopping malls, the expenses for gifts of products and the expenses for advertisement.
Therefore, various manufacturers keep increasing new products, canned new products, with increasingly grown price; in fact, these are the new products released due to the increase in market expenses.
They are released to acquire higher profits; in fact, the increased cost in raw materials is no more than 3 or 4 yuan.
Some other brands play hard in order to promote their products by cooperating with doctors in hospitals, who will be provided with commission of 30 – 80 yuan for each can.
Such operating methods are absolutely forbidden by Chinese laws; in fact, this practice is entrapping consumers.
Consumers are suggested to pour bagged milk powder into cans, to save expense; in this way, it increases the storage and sealing property of milk powder, with no influence on children.
In addition, in fact, the expiration date of canned milk powder is the same as that of bagged milk powder after unpacking; however, it is difficult for bagged milk powder to be stored, which is easier to be affected with damp, leading to moisture deterioration.
