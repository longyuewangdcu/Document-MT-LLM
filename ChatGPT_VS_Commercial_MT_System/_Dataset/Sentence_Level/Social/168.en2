I just read an article about period, and it’s too long.
I’ll introduce to men who don’t know about it.
Most girls will get their first period between 13 to15 years old, and have amenorrhea around 50.
Then they get period regularly once every month on the premise of good health.
But it is not so regular that you can precisely predict it; there is a difference of around a week; you need to prepare early and sometimes you may get unlucky and it arrives several days earlier.
The length of time, blood volume and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person; some people have it for three days and some people a week; some people have small flow and some people have way too much; some people don’t have any reaction, and some people feel so painful that they have to be taken away by the ambulance; dysmenorrhea will change over time, and not having it before doesn’t mean it won’t happen for a lifetime.
You can’t control menstruation; you bleed 24 hours from the beginning to the end, and all you can do is absorb blood with pads or tampons to prevent it from getting onto clothes or chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins; Taking ibuprofen can effectively relieve the pain of dysmenorrhea that month before menstruation begins, but taking it is useless to after dysmenorrhea begins.
It is easy to have diarrhea before the period due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If you are near the cycle and you have diarrhea for no reason at all, you will basically get your period within two days.
It is best to replace sanitary pads every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria; apart from sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month, and that is 42 pieces; if you add the ones prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, not just one piece every month.
(a little modification here, tampons do not need to be changed often; it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormones during menstruation may make you irritable, and ovulation may also make you emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is very troublesome; your body makes itself suffer.
However, you may see from the official crime rate data that women’s ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It’s not just blood, but also endometrium that fall off.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens; you may think that the uterus is a house; you build a house every month (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests, and if the guests do not come, all of them are demolished (menstruation flows out) and a new house is built next month, which starts again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient; you bleed 24 hours a few days a month for dozens of years, and it also causes abdominal pain and lower back pain; who would want that?
But people are born because their mother has menstruation; menstruation exists to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months before you come to this world; everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed; society brainwashed women and told them it’s dirty and shameful, and everyone thought that it was like that; but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, the female body’s preparation for life is disgusting, and it shouldn’t be said in public; girls, stand up and don’t think this way; men who have never experienced it, won’t experience it in this life, and don’t know much about it, don’t be so ungrateful and unkind; how can you face your mother and children in this attitude?
Finally, sisters, try tampons; they are really easy to use.
