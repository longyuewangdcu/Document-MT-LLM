Ding Zilin: to my friends.
I want to show my thanks to all the humanitarian aid provided by my friends within more than 30 years since our relatives died in the accident; especially, the aid has never been interrupted till now since I appealed to foreign friends in my name in 1994.
Parents of most victims have passed away, and their orphans have been grown up and have got married or got a job.
It was your magnanimous act that helped families like mine passed the toughest time.
At present, the coronavirus pandemic is spreading all over the whole world, and most donors will retire soon.
Therefore, I sincerely request you to stop the humanitarian donation to the mothers of the Tian An Men group, which should have been ended at an earlier time.
I will forever bear your love in mind, and will firmly believe that your magnanimous act will be remembered by the history.
I have to express my will due to some reasons, and please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Note from Tao Ye: Please allow me to introduce the history of the humanitarian act by IFCSS and MCDF for 32 years.
During the humanitarian act, IFCSS and MCDF are two parallel organizations, with intersection in executors of projects.

Sometimes, the aid fund could not be delivered to the relatives of the victims of the June 4 event.
In 1994, as suggested by Teacher Ding, a special group was established, in charge of receiving and distribution of the humanitarian donation.
In 1998, Children’s Education Fund for Orphans of June 4 was established by MCDF; after implementation of 11 years, when all the orphans graduated from schools in 2009, MCDF established the Relief Fund for Helpless Elderly and Poor Households, which has been implemented until now.
The funds of the projects were mainly from campus and social donations, as well as the MCDF.
Laogai Research Foundation has provided support from 2018.
Up until the last year, 31 years later, the relatives of the victims received part of the fund donated from Hong Kong.
During this period, China Human Rights was implementing its humanitarian aid independently.
We understand that Teacher Ding appealed to stop the donation because of thinking for the donors; we are actually retired elderly, with not as abundant salary as we did not retire; we are really thankful to the letter of “To my friends”.
We will respect the decisions of the relatives of the victims and will stop the project within 2 years, and will recover it immediately if it is necessary to do so.
I also want to show my thanks to the friends who helped others generously with money with risks.
