Ding Zilin: to friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance for more than 30 years after the death of our family, especially the uninterrupted assistance since I made an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my own name at the beginning of 1994.
Now the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have also grown up, started working and got married.
It is your chivalrous deeds that have helped these families in distress pass the most difficult time.
At present, COVID-19 is raging around the world, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to stop making humanitarian donations to the family of victims, Tiananmen Mothers group; this humanitarian relief event should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will remember your kindness forever and firmly believe your chivalrous deeds will be remembered by history forever.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way; please understand!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Yean: please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance of IFCSS and MCDF.
In the process of humanitarian relief, IFCSS and MCDF are parallel organizations, and there are often intersections between the project executors.

The relief funds often fail to reach the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement successfully.
In 1994, Ding advised that the “Tiananmen Mother” set up a special group to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the “June 4th Orphan Education Fund”; after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from University, MCDF then established the “June 4th Elderly with No Family Destitute Poverty Relief Fund”, which has been implemented until now.
The funds for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations of generous individual donations in the year of June 4th event, and were supported by the democracy foundation of brother universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Reform through Labor Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement finally received a part of the donation made by Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th Movement.
During this period, China Human Rights is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief project.
We understand that Ding called a stop to the June 4th donation for the consideration of the donors; we are indeed retired elderly, and our income is not as much as before; we hereby thank teacher Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect the decision of the family of the victims and terminate this project within two years and resume it immediately when necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous fellows who have been giving generously and taking risks to deliver humanitarian relief funds for many years.
