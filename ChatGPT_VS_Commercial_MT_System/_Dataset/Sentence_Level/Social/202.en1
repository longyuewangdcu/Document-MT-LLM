2. Although the right wing achieved its ambition in the history, but it was not long; it was short because it was really arrogant.
To be realistic, the right wing played positive roles during the social progress process.
The positive roles played by the right wing should not be denied on aspects of defining the standard of truth after the Cultural Revolution, improving science and technology by developing economy and administrative systemation and guarantee of human rights.
3. As far as I’m concerned, although I disagree part of the sayings of Li Weidong, I lay emphasis on his sayings and respect him; because he is serious to China and the social problems in China.
However, I object to his anti-communist theory; I think the anti-communist theory will certainly lead to revolution, which will inevitably lead to social instability, resulting in damages to people and swooping by foreign countries.
4. Patience and the attitude of being responsible for the country and for people are required to change or improve China; the people who intend to pull chestnut out of fire with political speculation attempt is not the right wing but the bastard.
Let’s talk about the left wing.
In fact, the left wing includes the abandoned persons of the era and the politics.
If it is said that the right wing plays positive roles to the society, and the Communist Party listens to the speech of the right wing and analyzes their thinking; therefore, the left wing is good for nothing, and what it wants is just those abandoned by the Communist Party!
5. Seeing that some people are blaming both mob rebels and the left wing, I don’t think it is necessary to do so.
Don’t try reasoning with traitors or the left wing, because there is no reason to talk with them.
Don’t try proving that we are correct, and don’t make the traitors or the left wing to admit it; we don’t need to do so.
I tell friends like this: When the traitors or the left wing blame us, it just proves that we choose the correct way!
Many people used to have ideals when they are young; however, they forget their ideal or pursue for ideal in a bigoted way after they grow old.
They go far from ideals; even more, and the people who fight against devil become the devil themselves.
The left wing and the right wing refer to restraint and freedom, and the inborn gene of the historic culture of China leads to a left trend.
The right wing in the country lays emphasis on freedom, efficiency and development, while the left wing strengthens supervision, fairness and safety.
The society wishes an environment of fairness; at the same time, the conflict between China and the U.S. determines a trend of the left wing; it is estimated to continue many years.
If you cannot understand it, just give a like.
Nothing more, and Huahua is so gallant.
