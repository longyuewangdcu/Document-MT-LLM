In recent two years, the blocking and containing of the U.S. on Huawei chips not only making Huawei trapped into unprecedented difficulties but also making “American system” enterprises suffer from huge damages.
The U.S. applies suppression on the China chip industry, and requires their enterprises and related enterprises in its allies to block the chip industry in our country, leading to the direct consequence that the orders and benefits of all the suppliers of chip all over the whole world are influenced, resulting in reduction in research and development investment of chip manufacturers and in production capacity, which leads to shortage of the chip supply chain all over the whole world.
Today, “lack of chips” has been spread to all major industries all over the whole world; halt production of car enterprises and rise in price of mobile phones, almost all the industries in need of chips are greatly influenced.
In order to master the autonomous right in “chips”, scientific and technological giants from more and more countries have taken the path of “de-Americanized”.
In order to firmly control the control right of the semiconductor of the whole world and restrain the development of the semiconductor industry in China, the U.S. has taken lots of actions recently by hosting the “Summit for Chips”, inviting 64 giants to form the Global Semiconductor Alliance, and supporting American local scientific and technological giants by making investment; for example, in order to take back the dominant role in the chip field, Intel, an old brand of scientific and technological enterprise of the U.S., invested in 20 billion USD to construct 2 wafer processing plants in Arizona, and provided the chip OEM service.
Most people consider that the action of Intel will lead to certain impact, and may grab the “job” of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
This is because that as an old brand of science and technology giant of the U.S., Intel has been engaged in the semiconductor field for dozens of years, with large amount of talent teams and technical reservations, and will inevitably rise within a short term, to defeat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, pays only beneath attention to the decision made by Intel.
Zhang Zhongmou spoke bluntly at the “2021Master Think Tank Forum” held in this April that: It is really ironical that Intel constructs an OEM factory of chips.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou disdains Intel to produce wafers is because that Zhang Zhongmou still takes the resentment of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to Intel 30 years ago to heart.
During 1960s – 1970s, Intel was a pearl of the manufacturing industry of the U.S., ranking top all over the whole world, and was the powerful chief of the global semiconductor field.
Up until 1980s, the global high-end chips had been always mastered by a few of giants.
The IDM mode was the characteristics of the semiconductor industry at that time, and the production of chips including design, manufacturing and closed beta test were all completed by the same factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a mode made some small enterprises overwhelmed; many entrepreneurs of semiconductors had to flinch when facing with the huge expenses for construction of production lines.
The division of labor occurred from 1980s in the chip industry due to market demands; Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were some companies engaged in design of chips in 1984, and thought that he could establish a plant in producing of wafers.
Before long, Zhang Zhongmou realized his imagination, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was established.
By aiming at the single link of “processing of wafers”, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company did not design wafers but only provided OEM services of wafer manufacturing.
The newly established company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, was only a small potato in front of Intel, the giant in the industry.
In order to acquire capital support, Zhang Zhongmou went to Intel to talk about matters related to investment; however, when hearing that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was engaged in the manufacturing link only, Intel looked down upon Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and refused to make investment in it.
Zhang Zhongmou firmly believed that Intel looked down upon the wafer manufacturing services.
However, the giant who looked down upon wafer manufacturing in those days decides to work on OEM of wafers today.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is really ironic for Intel to work on OEM of wafers.
Today, the market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has exceeded that of Intel.
Facing with the powerful attack from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel does not dare to stand still and refuse to make progress.
Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has developed to the 3nm chips; however, Intel still stays at the 14nm 7 years ago.
It is really difficult to catch up and surpass.
