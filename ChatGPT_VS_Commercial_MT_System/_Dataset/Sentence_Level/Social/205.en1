Let’s see some “strange trending topics” today.
What are normal public opinions?
We choose three top search topics randomly: Dragon Heads-raising Day, rise in price of Orion and the event of LaLaMove; the public opinions spread and form a wave peak, and then [reduce exponentially] (with a smooth curve), and finally disappear; there will be a small hump in condition of secondary public opinions.

What are abnormal public opinions?
We choose six top search topics of the same event randomly, showing the [isolated peak shape], the [sawtooth shape] and the [bluff shape].
The [isolated peak shape] is generated due to artificial heating, to give rise to attention from the public; the [sawtooth shape] is periodical heating, to ensure the topic ranks on the top ones; the [bluff shape] means collectively evacuating; i.e., the top search has finished its “function”, and new tasks have been received.
In Figure 9, the wave peak of an event is just the wave bottom of another event, with exact time; undoubtedly, the same group of online water army receives a new task and starts working.
We can see the professionality of anti-public relation: dozens of top search topics are ranking in the list at the same time; some attract attention, some are in charge of science popularization, some are picking fights, some are changing attention of the public, some are giving rise to influences on cognition, some are misleading judgment of the public, some are stirring up emotions, some are coercing in making decisions; the anti-public relation accounts attack with batches and nodes by taking almost all the factors in spreading of public opinions.
Spreading is a science; anti-public relation cannot hide depending on only objective data by putting all subjective factors such as standpoints and emotions aside.
There must be traces after walking; let’s dig them out.
