Is there any difference between laser television and traditional TV?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the topic owner shall be the liquid crystal display TV, and the differences between laser TV and liquid crystal display TV are listed as follows:
Firstly, laser TV focuses more on large-size screen monitor market.
When compared with the totally spread market positioning of liquid crystal display TV, laser TV focuses more on large-size screen monitor market; or we can see laser TV is the product generated for large-size screen monitors.
At present, the size of mainstream liquid crystal display TV is between 55 – 65 inch, and that of laser TV is generally above 75 inch, or even more than 100 inch at most, fully meeting the demands of customers on large-size screen monitors.
In recent years, the global sales volume and the global sales proportion of laser TV have been increasingly grown, with the proportion of more than 60% in total sales of TV of or above 80 inch.
According to prediction by The Yee, the sales volume of the laser TV market will increase by 140% in 2020, continuing keeping a high speed increase.
The excellent performance in the large-size screen monitor market is mainly attributed to the outstanding performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the diffuse reflection image-forming principle of laser TV, the ray of light sent by laser light source does not directly shine into eyeballs; when compared with the ray of light of backlight of liquid crystal display TV, its image-forming process is close to that of articles in natural conditions, leading to smaller stimulation to eyes.
According to the strict comparative trial between watching laser TV and liquid crystal display TV by the same people groups in the same conditions conducted by Ceci Lab of China Electronic Technology Standardization Institute and ophthalmologists of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, 144 groups of testing data have been acquired.
According to data: laser TV actually has strong eye protection property, which even plays improving role in specific aspects.
At present, vision health has been paid with more and more attention, laser TV has attracted more and more users due to the advantage in eye protection; in addition, it breaks through another field for the color TV market.
Secondly, laser TV lays more emphasis on high-end market.
Different from the increasingly lowered price of liquid crystal display TV, the price of most laser TVs is above 10 thousand yuan, which gradually increases with the upgrading of size and light source.
Why can laser TV be so expensive?
There must be some reasons.
With constant development of the light source and the technical level, laser TV has lots of advantages when compared with liquid crystal display TV and projection.
With the ultra-short focal length projection technology, when compared with the traditional projection equipment, laser TV has shorter projection distance, which can realize the 100 inch large-size screen experience within a short distance, in need of small space; in addition, the host occupies only a small space.
In view of brightness, the laser TV of a big brand can achieve the lumen of more than 2000.
In addition, with lower heating amount and less damage to equipment, it achieves longer service life.
Besides, multiple leading technologies such as the true 4K ultra high definition, AI system and bionic screen are equipped for the laser TV, providing users with more shocking audio and video experience.
In fact, it is the product of demand division; in terms of image quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not suitable for audio and video players; users can have a try about large-size screen and insufficient watching environment; however, the same knife cuts bread and fingers, and don’t trust all opinions of only one party.
Simply, in order to get closer to the curtain, the ultra-wide field short-focus projector – laser TV, has to use the ultra-wide field lens and the reflector with expensive price, which is not in accordance with the optimal design of optics.
In order to shield part of ambient light, the very expensive Fresnel curtain with microstructure is utilized, and the price of 80 inch is almost equal to a liquid crystal display TV of 65 inch.
In addition, I hate it very much when projection manufacturers take the diffuse reflection, which is propagated as being good for eyes, as the selling point; the ray of light on the curtain is the direct light for eyes, and the ray of light diffused to the ceiling cannot be seen by eyes; if you insist on it, liquid crystal display TV is also “diffuse reflection”, isn’t the ceiling lightened when you open the TV?
Besides, if the projection curtain is not diffuse reflection, no image can be formed.
The heat spot (facula) effect of the high-gain curtain is ignored; if large amounts of ray of light on a certain angle are reflected to eyes, it is really uncomfortable.
