What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of the market positioning?
In my understanding, traditional TV which the original post mentioned is LCD TV, and the differences between laser TV and LCD TV in terms of market positioning are mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses more on big screen market.
Compared with the all-round market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of big screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TV is mainly from 55 to 65 inches, and the size of laser TV is usually over 75 inches, with bigger ones over 100 inches, which can satisfy the customers’ need for big screen TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of the global shipments and sales of laser TV keeps increasing, accounting for over 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of CMM, the sales volume of laser TV market in 2020 will increase by over 140% and will continue to maintain a high-speed growth.
The reason for such great result in the big screen market is mainly the outstanding performance of laser TVs in eye protection .
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not go directly into the eyeball; compared with the backlight of LCD TV, its imaging process is closer to that of objects under natural conditions, with less irritation to the eyes.
Ophthalmologists from CES Laboratory, China Electronics Standardization Institute, and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 groups of test data through a strict comparative experiment of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
Statistics prove that laser TVs can indeed protect the eyes and may even make improvement in certain aspects.
As eye protection is gaining more and more attention, laser TVs not only attracted more and more customers with the feature of eye protection, but also made another breakthrough in the market of color TVs.
Second, laser TV focuses more on high-end market.
Contrary to the downward trend of the price of LCD TVs, price of laser TVs on the market now is over 10,000 yuan, and it went up gradually with the upgrading of size and source of light.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There must be a reason.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TVs have advantages that many LCD TVs and projectors don’t.
With the super short focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment; it can realize the 100 inch large screen experience within a short distance; the space required is not large, and the small host takes up very little space.
In terms of lightness, laser TVs from famous brands can reach over 2,000 lumens.
Plus, the heat is lower, equipment loss is small, and the service life of TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are equipped with real 4K ultra HD image, artificial intelligent systems, bionic screens and other cutting-edge technologies, bringing users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
It's not so much of a fake demand, but the product of demand segmentation; when it comes to image quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not what video and audio enthusiasts are after; if you want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try it; everything has its pros and cons, and you can make a decision yourself after deliberation; just don’t listen to only one side of the story.
Simply put, in order to get close to the screen, ultra wide angle close focus projector, laser TV, has to use expensive ultra wide angle lens and reflector, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, it uses an expensive microstructure Fresnel screen; the price of an 80-inch laser TV basically can be changed into a 65-inch LCD TV.
Another point is that I especially hate it when projector manufacturers using “diffuse reflection is good for the eyes” as a selling point; please, eyes can see the light on the screen means that it is direct light to the eyes; when it hit the ceiling, eyes cannot see it; if you want to be serious about it, then LCD TV also uses diffused “direct light”; isn’t the ceiling also illuminated when you turn on the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen does not use diffuse reflection, imaging is not possible at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light at a certain angle being reflected into the eyes is really uncomfortable.
