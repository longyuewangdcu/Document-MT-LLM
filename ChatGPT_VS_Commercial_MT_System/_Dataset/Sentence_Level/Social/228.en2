Is it safe to buy insurance on Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an insurance brokerage platform on the internet.
In terms of setup conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (revised in 2015)", the following three key requirements must be met to become an insurance brokerage company, shareholders and initiator have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the CIRC.
These three requirements are strict enough; in summary, it needs to have strength, to be approved by the national authoritative departments of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks across the country), and the shareholders’ conduct is descent; as an insurance brokerage company, Little Umbrella Insurance doesn’t need to be questioned by policyholders about whether it is legal or not; after all, not all insurance companies can meet these three requirements.
In this regard, it is not bad and worth trusting.
In terms of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, with star serious illness insurances of many companies on sale on this platform; for example, for the newly added HTLIC Super Mario 5 serious illness insurance, both the claim adjuster and the insurer are HTLIC, and Little Umbrella Insurance is only the third-party intermediary, whose reliability does not need to be questioned.
In terms of payment method: due to the lack of the operating expenses of the business outlets and the cost of the sales people’s salaries, internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, which supports monthly payment; it reduces the payment pressure of the policyholder, and can leverage of the insurance lever to the greatest extent in the meantime.
This is good.
It can be considered.
In terms of the professional level of sales personnel: this is especially important as insurance industry has a strict requirement on expertise; for many internet products, customers can apply for insurance by themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings; in terms of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when applying for insurance, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it; like this, there will be a lot of hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being rejected.
I worked as insurance telemarketing personnel in “Tencent Micro-Insurance” (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can tell you.
The insurance products on the internet are real and reliable, and it is the people who are not reliable; there are no professional practitioners on the internet, and there is much misleading information in sales.
For example: there is nothing wrong with sales strategies like 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million yuan, buy insurance and get free mobile phones, and get 60,000 serious illness insurance coverage for free; however, they withhold important information and won't tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the fee next month is charged normally, ranging from a few dozens to 200; many customers don’t know what they bought after they’ve been charged for one or two years.
They thought they could spend 1 yuan and get a six million claim settlement from the insurance company (pie in the sky).
Getting mobile phone for free means only policy ending with special numbers such as 6666 and 8888 can get a free phone, and no one will remind you again if the text message is sent to you and you don’t redeem it yourself.
(This is yet another trap for the policyholder) It is a short-term activity to claim 60000 serious disease insurance for free; if you only rely on this and there is no other commercial insurance, 60000 yuan will not solve any problem in case of the happening of a serious disease, and you will have nothing in your life later.
Our country is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales at present.
Therefore, there is no problem with the platform or the products; what matters is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the original post should think about it carefully; in fact, there are many offline insurance brokerage companies with a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from; some products are better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, helping each person save 2000-3000 yuan of premium per year.
If you have any question, feel free to communicate with me.
I am a Mingya Insurance Broker and have three years of experience in enterprise management training; I have served almost a thousand enterprise users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies; before insuring, I will analyze the needs of my client and customize products for them; while insuring, I will compare all the insurance companies and help my client achieve the best underwriting result; after insuring, I will organize and hold the insurance policy to make my client feel at ease.
Grow with each client for a lifetime.
Hopefully my answer will help the original post!
According to the definition of insurance supervising departments, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the applicant can complete the entire insurance process independently after clicking the insuring link.
In this process, neither the applicant nor the insurance consultant needs to sign, so all the steps can be fulfilled independently by the applicant.
Although insuring an Internet insurance product has no “sense of ritual”, and even there is no printed copy of contact, it doesn’t affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contract at all.
This pattern is somewhat similar to assembly line operation of “telemarketing”, but buying insurance this way will also have a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades; when we buy insurance, shouldn’t we seriously consider whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
