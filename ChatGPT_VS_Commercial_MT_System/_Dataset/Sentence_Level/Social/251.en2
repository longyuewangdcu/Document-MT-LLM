I talked to my friend about the recent 26% plunge in Meta and its loss of US $251 billion in market value; Zuckerberg responded that he was “facing unprecedented competition”; why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose revenue mainly comes from advertising; the advertising company that makes money today has its own channel for traffic.
Regardless of its function positioning, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. are all channels of traffic for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the biggest “advertisement alliance”; Many apps are externally connected to Meta’s advertising, and they achieve realization through Meta’s advertising platform.
But, the time has changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple’s privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users’ data information now, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple’s current privacy policy is very user-friendly; it will use explicit prompt to ask users whether they allow apps to access their own information; most people’s normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs again next, it will have a greater impact on Meta’s revenue.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta’s revenue growth has also been weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
We all know that Meta doesn’t have business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta’s revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies engaged in offshore business.
There are around hundreds of staff at its Hong Kong office and several major agents in the mainland.
When Chinese companies want to expand overseas market, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and so most of the money is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the TT of ByteDance now is one of Meta’s main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping ByteDance to do advertising at Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven’t specifically learned about it recently, but it’s definitely not better than before.
The stage when Chinese companies were burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms including TT is not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not the decline of revenue but lack of growth expectation.
The capital market not only focuses on income; more importantly, it depends on future expectations.
Obviously, the expectation for Meta is not enough.
In order to tell new stories to the market, Zuckerberg told the story about “Meta-universe”.
Meta-universe indeed should be one of the future directions, but the period of the realization of Meta-universe is long, and this story is not sufficient to support the market value of Meta.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Although Facebook is very popular now with an annual income of US $100 billion to $200 billion; in fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis; compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is not any good security moat.
Although the DAU of several of his social software is relatively high, and they are mainstream social software such as Facebook, WhatsApp; however, in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion could happen in the blink of an eye.
The unattainable concept of meta universe has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is in danger; this is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for new tracks, but I think his choice is wrong and there is no way back; the above is some of my thoughts for reference.
