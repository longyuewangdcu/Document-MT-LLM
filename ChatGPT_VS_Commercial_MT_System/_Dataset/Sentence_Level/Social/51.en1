I want to try tennis, and don’t know if you can insist on it, so I want to make practice with a cheap one.
In fact, price is often in direct proportion to friendliness; if you cannot distinguish, expensive ones are friendlier than cheap ones; in fact, the “beginner-level rackets” are industrial refuses.
They usually have low strength, leading to large vibrations when tennis balls hit on them; it is even difficult for masters to control it.
The logic and subtext for the existence is: tennis is really difficult, you will not be skilled in it, and you will not buy expensive ones, and you will give it up after playing to times; these ones are cheap, and you will not love them dearly.
When you can distinguish good ones from poor ones, you get progress; you will but expensive ones again, and I can sell two times of tennis rackets by earning two times of money.
I suggest you to buy a relatively better tennis racket of second hand with similar price, such as price or Dunlop; the two brands are not famous, with fair price, and you can spend 500 yuan or 600 yuan to buy a new one, or 200 yuan for a second-hand one, and you can enjoy the quality of a one-thousand tennis racket.
It’s friendly to beginners; however, it has little value after the beginner stage; however, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the beginner stage.
