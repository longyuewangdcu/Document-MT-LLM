What is the hottest thing in 2021?
Games of the Tokyo Olympic, of course.
Do you think only Olympic players can win a prize?
An article named Look! Project Managers Can Go for the Olympic Champion was really popular some time ago; project managers can take the lead in many projects: moving bricks, business trip and staying up are ordinary things for project managers, not to mention fire-fighting, holding the bag and apologizing.
An article seemingly playful tells the bitterness of project managers, telling the ability not equal to his ambition to the current project management work.
People who work on project management select to get themselves from difficulties in work by selecting some actions.
According to increasingly grown number of application for PMP (international certified qualification for project management professionals), more and more project management personnel improve their project management ability through learning.
According to Development Report of Project Management of 20 Years in China (1999-2019), up until September, 2019, the accumulated PMP® registration number of the whole country is nearly 600 thousand person-times, and about 420 thousand of them passed the PMP® authentication, and the number of certificate holders is 300 thousand, standing for 31.2% of the total amount of PMP® certificate holders all over the whole world.
The number of PMP certificate holders during the latest 10 years has been increasingly grown year after year, indicating that more and more project managers have realized that it is not sufficient to work according to “past experience”; the working environment changing quickly makes us realize that it is necessary for us to explore the road by standing on the shoulders of giants of science.
However, does PMP can make us do well in project management works?
According to many beginners of project management, the learning of the PMP/IPMP related courses can help them systematically master knowledge points such as ten fields and five process groups; however, they are confused when they are facing with real project management works.
Many project managers often reflect the following problems: improper project management identification, depending on too much about personal experience or project management theories, knowing nothing about practice; lack of systematic project management process system, which cannot be implemented during work, failure in accurate estimation on projects, poor control sensitivity, repeated delay of projects; undefined labor division, knowing nothing about coping with the “old stick” in teams, unsmooth communication among different departments, difficulty in promoting projects......
