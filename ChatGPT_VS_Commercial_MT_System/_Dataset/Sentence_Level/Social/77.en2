It is said to have the biggest exhaust noises of all supercars in Xinshan District!
The car that our team brings you now is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini’s flagship supercar and Murcielago’s next generation model, Aventador LP700-4!
It is priced nearly 2 million MYR and pays a road tax of around a dozen thousand each year; it is a four-wheel drive; why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower; can you image how fast that is?
Forget it, I don’t know, either; data says it takes only 2.9s to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h; when my myvi just reaches 30km/h, it is already at 100km/h, hum.
The low car body, extravagant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine transparent under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
The model doesn’t need much introduction; you can Google it yourself; I have prepared something Google won’t necessarily be able to provide!
It is too eye-catching; people look at it everywhere you go; it is uncomfortable! (It is actually sweet.)
Gas is around RM1 for 1km (the owner wouldn’t even care)
You need to practice the posture of when you get in and out of the car or it may be a little awkward (because you might get stuck halfway and crawl out).
The engine is so loud that you will turn deaf when you get out of the car. (But still, it’s sweet.)
The car body is too big; it will be narrow for it to park at a normal parking space; you will worry that the neighboring car might hit it while opening the door!
You may get lonely because there is no rivalry on the road (I made it up; it has nothing to do with the car owners, haha.)
Don’t get me wrong; the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Please contact us if you want to take a video for your car!

A car crash involving tens of millions!
I believe car fans all know Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911; Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also over a million!
Recently, a car crashed into a million-level sports car 911 and a tens-of-millions level super car Chiron in just a few minutes in a foreign country!
It seems from the result that there’s a reason why it is so expensive!
