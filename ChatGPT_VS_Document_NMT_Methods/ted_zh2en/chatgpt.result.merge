A few years ago, at the TED conference, Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the "Marshmallow Challenge." It is a very simple idea that requires a team of four people to build a free-standing structure using 20 pieces of spaghetti, a piece of tape, a piece of string, and a marshmallow placed at the top. While this may seem simple, it is not easy because it requires people to quickly work together. I think this is an interesting idea, so I brought it to a design workshop, and it was very successful. Since then, I have used this exercise in over 70 design workshops around the world with students, designers, architects, and even chief technology officers of Fortune 50 companies. This exercise has given us profound insights and taught us the characteristics of collaboration. Usually, people start by discussing the task and what the result should look like. They argue with each other about right and wrong, then spend some time planning and organizing. They draw some sketches and then take out the spaghetti. They spent a lot of time assembling the spaghetti higher and higher, and finally, when time was almost up, they took out the marshmallow and carefully placed it on top. Then they stepped back and laughed as they admired their creation. But most of the time, the "ha-ha" moment turned into "oh no" as the weight of the marshmallow caused the whole structure to collapse. Some people had more "oh no" moments than others, with the worst being newly graduated business school students who lied, cheated, and were easily distracted. Their structures were very poorly constructed. Of course, there were also teams that created more "ha-ha" moments, with the best being newly graduated kindergarten children. This is truly amazing, as Peter tells us that they not only built the tallest structure but also the most interesting one. So you might ask, what is the reason for this? What makes them different? Peter likes to say, "Because no child is trying to be the CEO of a spaghetti company." Yes. "They didn't spend any time competing for power, but there's another reason. The professional training that business school students receive is to find the right plan, and then execute according to the plan. However, the fact is that when they put the marshmallow on top, they ran out of time, and then the crisis came. Sound familiar? Yes. Kindergarteners do it differently. They start with the marshmallow and build a prototype, and then continuously add to the model, always keeping the marshmallow on top. So they always have many opportunities to continuously refine the prototype. As a result, the designers realize that this collaboration is an important factor in the interactive process. For each version, children quickly receive feedback. They know what works and what doesn't." So, the key is the ability to grasp the embryonic form. Let's take a look at how different teams perform. The average height of the towers built by most people is 20 feet. Business school students, about half of that. Lawyers are a bit better, but not much. Kindergarten children are better than most adults. Who does it best? Architects and engineers, thank goodness. The tallest tower I've seen is 39 inches. Why? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometric patterns, which are the key to building stable structures. CEOs are slightly better than average, but interestingly, if you add an administrative assistant to their team, their performance immediately improves significantly. It's unbelievable. You look around and say, "That team will win." You knew it early on. Why? Because they have special simplification skills. They manage the process and understand the process. In short, if any team actively manages and focuses on the work itself, the team's performance will be significantly improved. The combination of special skills and the ability to use simple methods brings success. If you have 10 teams participating in this activity, about 6 of them can build upright structures. I made an interesting attempt. I thought, let's bet on it. So I offered $100,000 worth of software to the winning team. Can you guess how those design students would react? What was the result? So this is the result. None of the groups completed a standing building, even if any of them completed a one-inch building, they could take the trophy back. So, interestingly, the high prize money has a significant impact. We repeated this activity among the same group of students later. Guess what the result was? This time, they knew the value of making a prototype model. So, the worst group became the best group, and they completed the tallest building in the shortest amount of time. These have deep educational implications for us and reveal the nature of rewards and success. So, you may ask, why would anyone spend time writing such a marshmallow challenge? The reason is that I can use electronic tools and processes to help people make cars, electronic games, and simulate visual effects. The marshmallow challenge teaches us to identify hidden assumptions because, frankly, every project has its own marshmallow. This challenge provides experiences that can be shared, a common language, and a universal method of dealing with problems. This simple exercise can provide us with valuable experiences. If you're interested, you can go to the marshmallowchallenge.com website. This is a blog you can read that tells you how to build a marshmallow building. There are specific step-by-step instructions and weird examples from around the world of how people adjust systems. There are also world records. And I believe that the fundamental teaching is: design is actually a communication movement. It requires us to put all our senses into the task and to use the best mindset, perception, and action to meet the challenges we face. Sometimes, the experience of a small prototype model can help us turn the "oops" moment into a "ha-ha" moment, and the results are very different. Thank you.
Let's imagine there's a machine here, a big, cool, TED machine, and it's a time machine. Everyone here has to step into this time machine. You can choose to go back in time or step into the future, but you can't stay in the present. I wonder how you would choose. I've asked my friends this question many times and they always say, "Go back in time." I don't understand. They say they want to go back to a time without cars, without Twitter or American Idol. I really don't understand. I'm sure there's some nostalgia or wishful thinking involved. I can understand that. But I have to admit, I'm not one of them. I don't want to go back to the past, not because I love adventures, but because the possibilities on this planet are not found in the past, you have to go to the future. That is to say, I want to step into this machine and go to the future. Our era is the best era, no matter how you measure it, such as health, wealth, liquidity, opportunity, and decreasing illness rates. It has never been such a good time. My great-grandparents died at the age of 60. My grandparents died in their 70s. My parents passed away in their 80s. I hope that when I die, it will be in a time that starts with the number 9. But this is not just about us as individuals because the reality is much larger than ourselves. A baby born today in New Delhi can expect to live as long as the wealthiest person in the world did 100 years ago. Think about that for a moment. It's an incredible fact. Why is this the case? It's because we've eradicated smallpox. Smallpox once claimed the lives of hundreds of millions of people on this planet. It reshaped the demographics of our world in ways that no war ever could. But today it's gone. We, as a species, eradicated it. In the affluent societies of today, diseases that threatened the lives of millions of people just a generation ago are now almost unheard of. Diseases like diphtheria, measles, and polio have nearly disappeared. Do you know what those names mean? The ability to provide vaccines and modern medicine, and to feed millions of people are all victories of the scientific method. In my view, the scientific method is a process of constant experimentation, testing, and refinement. It is one of humanity's greatest achievements. So, these are all good news. Unfortunately, that's where the good news ends, because we have some other challenges that have been talked about many times before. One of them is that, despite great progress, there are still a billion people in the world who go hungry every day, suffering the torment of hunger. This number is rising, and it's rising quickly. It's a shameful situation for us to be in. Furthermore, human imagination has generated a massive amount of waste on our planet. Drinking water, arable land, tropical rainforests, oil, natural gas, and other resources are all disappearing, and disappearing quickly. Unless we innovate, we will have no hope. The question is: can we do it? I think we can. I believe we can produce enough food to feed billions of people without damaging the land they depend on for survival. I believe that we can find environmentally friendly sources of energy to supply the world's energy needs. I truly believe in this theory, it is not just a figment of my imagination. But there are always things that keep me up at night. This is one of the things that keeps me up at night. Never before in human history have we needed technological advancements as urgently as we do today, and never before have we had the opportunity to use these technologies according to our own will. In many fields, we are living in an era of astonishing discoveries. In fact, I believe we need to look back, back 300 years, to a time before the Renaissance, when people resisted progress and were even more vehement in their opposition to technological advancements than we are today. People always like to put themselves in their own ideological frameworks, and they wrap themselves up so tightly that they cannot escape. Even when presented with the truth, they are often unable to waver from their beliefs. Listen, everyone can hold onto their own viewpoints, even their viewpoints on progress, but do you know what you can't hold onto? You can't just hold onto what you know to be true. Truly, you can't. It took me a while to comprehend this. About ten years ago, I wrote a story for The New Yorker about vaccines. It was a small story, but I found that so many people opposed me. They were opposing the most effective public health prevention measure in human history. I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I had to do. I finished the story and moved on to other things. Not long after, I wrote an article about genetically modified foods. Again, I received a lot of opposition, even more than the last time. People were going crazy. So I wrote an article in response, saying that I really couldn't understand why people were demonizing this food. I didn't understand why people thought that moving biological molecules in a specific way instead of an arbitrary way was playing with nature. But I still did what I had to do. After I finished the story, I didn't pay any attention to it. I am a journalist. Our job is to write articles, publish them, eat, and that's our life. But these experiences still make me feel uncomfortable, and I didn't know why until later. The fanatics who once drove me crazy were not actually fanatics. They were people with ideas, well-educated, and upright citizens. They are like the people in this room. This really gave me a headache. Later, I thought to myself: to be honest, our era today has a different relationship with progress than in the past. We now look at progress with a skeptical eye. We will talk about progress in a sarcastic tone and add quotation marks around it: "progress". I think there is a reason for this, and we know what that reason is. We have lost trust in civil institutions, governments, and sometimes even science, and perhaps we do have reasons not to trust them. Just name a few, and you know what the reasons are. Chernobyl, Bhopal, Challenger, Vioxx for arthritis, weapons of mass destruction, and half a dozen hanging chads. I think everyone can make such a list in their own hearts. What we used to trust completely has now gone wrong. So we should still have a skeptical attitude. We need to ask questions and demand proof and evidence. Everything should not be taken for granted. But there is one thing to note. When you get evidence, you need to accept that evidence, but we are not good at doing this. The reason, I think, is that we now all have a contagious disease of fear, a breadth and depth of contagion that I have never experienced before and hope will never happen again. Twelve years ago, the media exposed a very scary piece of news that associated autism with the injection of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. It is indeed frightening. As a result, a large number of studies have been conducted around this event. It is necessary to do these studies because it is a serious event. Finally, the data came out. Data from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, and Canada verified the same conclusion that there is no link between autism and vaccines, no connection at all, absolutely no connection. But this result is not of great significance to the public. Because we like to hear small stories, we believe what we see with our own eyes, believe what we think we see in our hearts, and believe in things that make us feel real. But we just don’t believe in a pile of laboratory reports, don’t believe in data from government departments. I can also understand this point. I think we all have this mentality. But what are the consequences? The consequences are unimaginable. Please listen to this fact: the United States is the only country in the world where the measles vaccination rate is declining. This is enough to make us feel ashamed, we should be ashamed of this. It's a terrible thing. What caused this to happen? Now I understand. Really understand. Has anyone here had measles? Did any of you see someone die from measles? Not many, not many. In fact, it doesn't happen in this country, but in the past year, 160,000 people died from measles. This number is huge, and basically, 20 people die every hour because of it. But because it didn't happen around us, we can ignore it, and people like Jenny McCarthy can still spread their fears and ignorant information on Oprah and Larry King's shows. The reason they do this is that they don't see the cause and correlation together. They also don't know that things that look the same are never the same. We need to learn from this and the sooner the better. This man named Jonas Salk is a hero. Because he invented the polio vaccine, people avoided the worst disaster. Now people don't have to fear getting this disease or suffer from it. Polio has disappeared. The man in the middle wasn't so lucky. His name is Paul Offit. He and several other researchers invented the rotavirus vaccine. This vaccine can save the lives of 450 million children in developing countries every year. It should be a good thing, right? It is indeed very good. This is why Paul goes around telling people how good these vaccines are and that they can say goodbye to suffering. He really says that. As a result, we treat Paul as a terrorist. When Paul is required to testify publicly, he must have armed security around him. He receives threatening calls at home because people tell him they know where his children go to school. Why? Because Paul invented a vaccine. I don't really need to talk about this, but vaccines are extremely important. Once vaccinations stop, diseases will return and they are very terrible diseases, and this is happening. Now measles has also appeared in the United States. And the situation is getting worse and worse. Soon, there will be children who will die from this disease, it's just a matter of numbers. It's not just measles, you know. What about polio? Who dares to say it won't come back? A college classmate of mine wrote me a letter a few weeks ago, saying I'm being too vocal now. No one has ever said that to me before. She said she's not going to vaccinate her child against polio. Definitely not. Well, why not? Because there's no polio in this country. But you know what? Yesterday we didn't have this infectious disease. Today, I don't know, maybe a guest got on a plane from Lagos, headed for Los Angeles airport, and now he's in Ohio. A few hours later, he will reach the ground and take a taxi to Long Beach to attend one of the TED dinners here. He doesn't know if he's infected with polio, and we don't know either. That's the fact of the world. Don't think it's not. We like to believe in lies. We all like to do that. Did you all take your vitamins this morning? Or echinacea, or a little bit of antioxidant, only when you take these things can you feel more alert. The reason you do this is that half of Americans do this every day. They will take these things, and they will take alternative medicines, even though we already know that these things are actually ineffective. The data says so. Taking these things only makes your urine turn black. Besides that, they don't do anything. If you are willing to spend $28 billion to get some black urine, I have no objection. It's black urine, black. Why do we do this? Why? I think I may understand. Our pharmaceutical industry in this country is very large. And we all hate big government because we don't trust the people inside. But we don't have to do this. Our healthcare system is very bad. For millions of citizens, it is a cruel system, and for those who can afford it, it is also a very cruel and ruthless medical system. So we try to escape from this system. Where do we go? We embrace the vast embrace of the placebo. This is very exciting, and I really like placebos. But you need to know that this is indeed a serious matter because this thing is a piece of junk, but we spend billions of dollars to buy placebos. I brought various samples here. None of them are effective, whether it's ginkgo biloba, echinacea, acai berry, they're all just a facade. I don't even know what some of them are, but we've spent tens of billions of dollars buying them, and this is deception. But you know what? When I say this, people will scream at me. They will say, "Mind your own business! Let people make their own choices! Taking placebos at least makes people feel comfortable!" You know what? You're wrong. I won't keep it to myself. If the US Secretary of Health and Human Services says, "I don't care about the evidence found by experts about mammography," or if a quack cancer doctor tries to treat his patients with coffee enemas, if you believe in beliefs and magic rather than evidence and science, you will end up in a place you don't want to be. Maybe you'll end up like South Africa's former leader Mbeki. He insisted that beetroot, garlic, and lemon oil were more effective in treating AIDS than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the progression of the disease. This led to the deaths of 400,000 people from AIDS. Thousands of people who didn't have to die died as a result. And it just so happens to be the area where AIDS is most prevalent in the world. Don't tell me these examples don't have serious consequences. There are always consequences. Now, the most ignorant infectious disease we encounter is the foolish confrontation between the two camps of genetically modified and organic farming. This is also a stupid argument. We must stop such arguments. Because what is being debated is just words and metaphors themselves. It's an ideological argument, not a scientific one. Everything we eat, every grain of rice, every sprig of cilantro, every Brussels sprout we ingest, has been altered by humans. Because there were no oranges in the Garden of Eden. There is no cantaloupe, and there won't be a Christmas tree either. These are all artificially created things that humans have developed over the past 11,000 years. Some experiments have succeeded, while others have failed. The failed attempts have been abandoned. Now we can conduct experiments in a more precise way. There will certainly be risks involved, but we can put vitamin A into the genes of rice, which will save millions of lives or extend their lifespans. Don't you want to make this effort? I can only say that I don't understand why some people oppose genetically modified foods. The reasons I often hear are: "There are too many chemicals in genetically modified foods, too many pesticides, hormones, and monoculture production. Indeed, we don't want hundreds of acres of land to produce the same crop, which is not good. We also don't want commercial companies to patent new crops. We don't want large companies to monopolize seeds. Can you guess my response to these objections? Yes, you guessed it right. Let's work together to solve these problems. It's true that we face very serious food problems, but this is not a scientific problem because it has nothing to do with science. It's a problem related to law, ethics, and patent law. You know, science is not a company, not a country, not even an idea, it's a process. This process sometimes succeeds and sometimes fails, but it is very scary to think that we should not let scientists do their job because we are afraid, and this will also hinder millions of people from moving towards prosperity. In the next 50 years, we need to plant 70% more food than we do now. This is the total investment we have made in Africa in the past 30 years. It is embarrassing. People there need these, but we don't give them. Why? Also because of genetically modified food. We do not encourage people to eat spoiled food, such as spoiled cassava. There are 50 million people in the world who rely on eating cassava for a living. It is a crop that is similar to potatoes, but with only calories and a bad taste. There is no nutrition or protein in cassava, but now scientists are trying to add these to it. People who eat these improved cassavas can avoid blindness and hunger. You will understand that this is a good thing. Although it cannot compare to high-end restaurants, it is still a good thing. I can only say, why do some people oppose this? Let's ask ourselves: why do we oppose it? Is it because we don't want to move the genome? This is only moving some genome and has nothing to do with adding chemicals or hormones. We always hope to obtain bigger, better, and more specialized food. This is not to make rice cakes, but to let some people survive. It is time for us to seriously understand the meaning of this process. Did you know that if we don't do this, and instead stick to the current approach, we will have a sense of guilt in the future because of things we don't want to happen? That will be high-tech colonialism. No other words are more suitable to describe this situation. This is selfish and dirty. Such actions will only lower our dignity, and we must stop doing this. After this very interesting conversation, you may ask, "Will you still walk into this time machine and head towards the future?" Of course, I will. The machine is now stopped in the present, but we have a great opportunity. We can set the time machine arbitrarily. We can go wherever we want to go. We need to have these conversations and we need to think, so that when we enter the time machine and head towards the future, we will be happy with our choices. I believe we can do it, and as I understand it, this is what the world needs right now. Thank you everyone. Thank you.
One day, Steve Lopez, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times, was walking on the streets of Los Angeles when he heard a beautiful piece of music. The music was being played by a man, an African American man, a charming and rugged homeless man, using a violin with only two strings left. Many of you may already know the story that I'm about to tell because Steve's column later became the basis of a book and then a movie, with Robert Downey Jr. playing Steve Lopez and Jamie Foxx playing Nathaniel Anthony Ayer. Nathaniel was originally trained as a double bassist at the Juilliard School of Music, but his career was tragically interrupted by paranoid schizophrenia. Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard and completely fell apart. Thirty years later, he was homeless and wandering on Skid Row in Los Angeles. I encourage everyone to read Steve's book or watch the movie, not only to understand the beautiful bond that was established between these two men but also to see how music helped build that bond and ultimately became the most useful tool in changing Nathaniel's life on the streets. I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, two years ago, at the Disney Concert Hall. He had just heard Beethoven's First and Fourth Symphonies. The day after tomorrow, we introduced ourselves. He spoke pleasantly and sociably, mentioning Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton, saying that the Dodgers could never make it to the World Series because of the unpredictable violin playing that starts in the last moment of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. We talked about music for a while. A few days later, I received a letter from Steve telling me that Nathaniel was interested in learning how to play the violin. I should mention that Nathaniel refused treatment because he had received electroconvulsive therapy with sedatives and handcuffs, and those scars remained in his life. As a result, his schizophrenia now becomes more prone to outbreaks. The worst manifestation is that he disappears for several days after an outbreak and wanders on Skid Row Street, exposing his inner fears and releasing the agony in his soul. Nathaniel was once in such a state when we began our first lesson at the Disney Concert Hall. His eyes were mixed with frenzy, and he was a lost person. He mentioned invisible demons and smoke, and someone poisoning him while he was asleep. I was afraid, not for my own safety, but afraid of losing him. He would immerse himself in one of his states, and I would ruin the relationship he had built with his violin. So, I started playing the violin. I played the first movement of Beethoven's Violin Concerto. When I played, I knew there was a mysterious change in Nathaniel's eyes. It seemed like he had caught some invisible medicine, as if he had undergone a chemical reaction, and my playing was the catalyst. His manic anger was transformed into understanding, quiet curiosity, and elegance. Miraculously, he picked up his violin and began to play some passages from the violin concerto, and then he asked me to complete the Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, and so on. So, we began to talk about music: from Bach to Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, all the people whose names begin with "B," from Bartók to Aïsha Pécaud-Salomon. I found out that Nathaniel was not just a music encyclopedia, but he could also connect this music with his personal feelings. When he talked about these things, he was passionate and had a deep understanding of music, just like when I communicate with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra through playing and talking about music. This person who was previously paranoid, anxious, and just wandering around the streets of Los Angeles, suddenly became a charming, knowledgeable, and accomplished musician who had received an education from the Juilliard School of Music. Music is a healing balm. Music changes us. For Nathaniel, music helped him open his mind because music could help him convert his thoughts and delusions into forms. Through his imagination and creativity, he turned them into reality, which helped him break free from his torment. And I know that this is the essence of art. This is why we create music. We use something inherent in all of us, our fundamental core, our emotions. We use our artistic perspective and creativity to shape our emotions into reality. And this expression of reality is conveyed to all of us, moving us, inspiring us, and uniting us. And for Nathaniel, music brings him back to a group of friends. The power of music saved him and brought him back to the music community, where people understand him, acknowledge his talent, and respect him. And I will always create music for him, whether it's in the music hall of Disney or on the streets of Skid Row, because he reminds me why I want to be a musician. Thank you, Bruno Giussani. Thank you, Robert Gupta. Now, I will play a piece of music that I shamelessly stole from a cellist for you all, so please forgive me.
My name is Jane McGonigal and I am a game designer. I have been designing online games for 10 years. My goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy to solve real-life problems as it is to play online games. Now, let me explain why I say this. If people were playing bigger and better games, including all of you here, and spending more time gaming, my argument would be more convincing. Currently, people spend 3 billion hours a week playing online games. Some of you might think, "That's a lot of time spent playing games." And maybe it is, considering all the urgent problems we have to deal with in real life. But, based on my research at the Institute for the Future on this topic, I can tell you that we're not spending too much time gaming. Three billion hours a week of gameplay isn't nearly enough to solve the real-life problems we face. In fact, I believe we need to massively increase our gaming time to better survive on this planet. I've done the math, and we need 21 billion hours of gaming per week. Perhaps this goes against common sense, but I want to say it again so that this idea can be fully understood. If we want to solve problems such as hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflicts, and obesity, I firmly believe that we need to encourage people to play online games, for at least 21 billion hours per week. Of course, this will happen in ten years' time. Actually, I am serious, not joking. Here is the explanation. We gather these scenes together, which is why games are so important for the survival of the human race in the future. Really. This is a portrait taken by Phil Toldano. He wanted to capture some emotional changes when playing games. Therefore, he placed the camera in front of the game player who was playing the game. This is a classic expression of a game player. Now, if you are not a gamer, you will not perceive the true meaning of this photo. You may feel urgency, a little fear, rather than a high level of concentration, or focused on solving a problem. If you are a gamer, you will feel something different. The wrinkles around the corners of the eyes and mouth are upward, which is a very optimistic sign. And eyebrows raised upwards are a sign of surprise. This indicates that the game player is about to achieve an epic victory in the game (a wonderful and unimaginable victory). Laughter. You have heard this word before, so some of you are gamers. This epic victory is a result, but it is very inspiring. You never thought you could succeed before you got this victory. This success even exceeded your imagination. Once you reach and complete it, you will be shocked by your own skills. This is what is called an "epic victory". And this player is about to achieve such a victory. At the same time, this is also the expression we expect to see when dealing with many global problems in the next century, and overcoming all obstacles. People who can overcome all difficulties are invincible. Unfortunately, when we deal with various emergencies in daily life, we often see this expression. I usually call this expression the "not good at life" expression. In fact, I made this myself. Can you tell from it? Alright, this is the "not good at life" expression that I made when I was studying for my PhD in a old community in Berkeley, California. My doctoral research topic was "Why do we feel that the virtual game world is better than the real world?" This is also a problem for many gamers. We feel that we cannot adapt to real life as well as we do in games. I don't think adaptation is equal to success; the two are not equivalent. Although adaptation is a part of success, we do indeed achieve more success in the gaming world. However, adaptation here refers to the internal drive to do important things, to inspire collaboration and cooperation. When we are in the gaming world, I feel that we can be our best selves. When we see a message, we will go help others and persist in solving a problem. When faced with setbacks, we bravely stand up and continue to fight. However, in real life, when we face failure, when we encounter obstacles, we usually don't feel that way. We may feel suppressed, helpless, anxious, or even depressed, disheartened, or cynical. We don't have the same feeling as when we play games. This is what I studied when I was a graduate student. Can games make us feel that it is impossible to achieve anything? How can we transfer the feeling we get from games to our work in real society? Therefore, I studied some games like "World of Warcraft," which are the ideal platform for solving collaboration problems. I noticed something that made epic victories possible in online games. The first thing is that whenever you appear in these online games, especially "World of Warcraft," there are many different roles that trust you and will help you complete the mission of saving the world. However, not all missions are like this, but only those that completely match your current level. Therefore, you have the ability to complete them. The first thing is that designers will not give you a task that you cannot complete with your current ability. However, completing the task requires you to push your limits, so you must do your best. In "World of Warcraft," everyone has their own position, and there are no spectators. There are always some very special and important things waiting for you to complete, and there are many people in the game world who can collaborate with you. No matter where you go, there are thousands of people waiting to work with you to complete these arduous tasks. It's not that easy in real life. This feeling of having thousands of partners at our fingertips is not so simple in real life. In games, there are wonderful storylines, which attract and motivate us. At the same time, any effort we make will receive a positive response. You must have heard of level-ups, which come with an increase in strength and intelligence. However, we do not have this continuous feedback in real life. For example, when I step off this stage, I will not have a +1 in public speaking or +1 in crazy creativity, let alone a +20 in crazy creativity. In real life, I haven't received any rewards, but in virtual environments like World of Warcraft, cooperating with others is a very pleasant thing because we can continuously work towards the final victory. That's why we are always immersed in the game world because it's better than reality. So far, World of Warcraft players have spent a total of 5.93 million years solving various virtual problems in Azeroth. This is not a bad thing, although it may sound like one. Let's write down these numbers: 5.93 million years ago, our human ancestor, the hominid, began to walk upright. This was the first hominid animal to walk upright. Therefore, when we talk about the amount of time we have spent on games, the only reasonable way to understand this is to think about how much time we have spent in the process of human evolution. And this is such an extraordinary thing! Thinking in this way is appropriate because you will find that by spending a lot of time playing games, we can change our ability to be human. We are constantly evolving into a more collaborative and resilient species. I firmly believe this to be true. Let's take a look at an interesting survey. The results of this survey were published by a researcher from Carnegie Mellon University. In a country with a strong gaming culture, young people today spend an average of 10,000 hours playing online games before the age of 21. Now, 10,000 hours is an interesting number for two reasons. Firstly, American children from fifth grade to high school graduation spend 10,080 hours in school. Of course, you need to perform well (attend classes on time) to do so. We have parallel tracking education data that shows that the time young people spend becoming good gamers is the same as the time they spend learning in school. Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book "Outliers," so you're not unfamiliar with the author's views on the theory of success. The 10,000 hour rule of success is based on cognitive science research. If we can spend 10,000 hours before the age of 21 focusing on learning or doing something else, then we will undoubtedly achieve great success in these areas. We will become world-class experts in anything we do. Now, what we are focusing on is a whole generation of young people who are good at games. The biggest problem is "what are these gamers good at?" If we can answer this question, we will discover an unprecedented human resource - those gamers who spend at least one hour playing online games every day, and are all skilled game masters. There are 500 million people who are good at something, and in the next decade, more than one billion new gamers who are good at a certain field will join in. If you haven't heard of it, let me tell you, this is happening. The gaming industry has been constantly developing. Nowadays, its low power consumption and the transformation from broadband internet to wireless mobile networks allow gamers from all over the world, especially those from India, China, and Brazil, to compete on the same platform. It is predicted that there will be one billion new players in the next decade. By then, we will have 1.5 billion gamers. Therefore, I started thinking early on, where will these games lead us? I think there are four main aspects. The first is a positive attitude towards emergencies and optimism. Imagine it as extreme self-motivation. The eager optimism is combined with a belief in oneself and a desire to immediately overcome obstacles. Gamers always believe that even an impossible victory is still possible. Gamers are not isolated, they are very good at forming tight social structures. An interesting survey showed that we prefer to play with people who play games with us, even if they beat us. The reason is that we accumulate trust during the game. We trust them because they spend the same amount of time, follow the same rules, and have the same goals as us. We fight shoulder to shoulder until the end of the game. Based on this, playing games together can indeed establish rapport, trust, and cooperation, and we will build a stronger social network as a result. "The productivity of happiness" - I really like this term. On average, World of Warcraft players spend 22 hours a week playing the game, like a part-time job. There's a reason for that: playing games with extra effort can make us happier than leisure or shopping. As humans, we prefer to do things that are challenging yet interesting. If a suitable task is provided to a gamer, they will continue to play the game with all their efforts. Finally, there's the meaning of the epic. Gamers like to attach themselves to the majestic tasks that involve the interstellar human story. Even the smallest tasks you do will become part of that final beautiful vision. Everyone has heard of Wikipedia, the world's largest wiki (a hypertext system open to collaborative creation on the Internet). The second largest wiki in the world is the World of Warcraft wiki, with approximately 80,000 articles and 5 million people using it every month. It contains more information about World of Warcraft than any other topic on the Internet. This creates an epic story and also creates an enormous knowledge resource about World of Warcraft. This is an example of concentrating those four superpowers on one thing. Gamers are a highly empowered and hopeful group who believe they have the power to change the world. But the problem is they believe the world they can change is the virtual world, not the real world. This is the problem I am trying to solve. There is an economist named Edward Castronova whose work is outstanding. He studies the reasons why people spend so much time, energy, and money on online games. He said, "We are witnessing masses of people addicted to virtual worlds and online games." Because he is an economist, he is rational. He also said... Unlike me, who is just a game designer, I am full of vitality. He also said that playing games has become more meaningful because gamers can get more things in the virtual world than in real life. They can have better social relationships in the game than in real life. Players can also get better rewards and a sense of achievement than in real life. Therefore, he said that spending more time in virtual space is more meaningful for gamers than in real society. I still think this is rational, but in any case, it is not the best option. We have to start building the real world like a game from now on. Therefore, I got inspired by something that happened 2,500 years ago. These are ancient dice made from the joints of sheep bones. Before we designed game controllers, we humans already had dice made from sheep joints. This is the earliest game equipment designed by humans. If you are familiar with the works of ancient Greek historians such as Herodotus, you will understand this history of the invention of games and the reasons behind it. Herodotus said that games, especially dice games, were invented by the kingdom of Lydia during a great famine. Obviously, there was such a serious famine in history. The King of Lydia decided to do some crazy things that they had to do. At that time, the people were suffering and fighting with each other, and the situation was very critical. They needed an extreme solution. According to Herodotus, they invented the dice game and formulated a nationwide policy. One day, everyone can eat, but the next day, everyone can only play games. People focused on playing dice games because the game was very attractive and could immerse us in such a self-satisfying happy "production" activity. People will forget the fact that they have no food to eat. The next day, people will live by playing games. The following day, they will go to eat. According to Herodotus, the people of Lydia spent 18 years in this way, eating one day and playing games the next day, and successfully passed the famine. This is how we view games today. We escape the pain in reality by playing games. We use games to avoid those incomplete and unsatisfactory things in the real environment, while obtaining what we need from them. And this process can be endless. According to Herodotus, there was no sign of improvement or improvement in the famine after 18 years. Therefore, the king decided that the people of the whole country would play the last game of dice. He divided the people of the whole country into two groups equally, and they played a dice game together. The winning side of the game will embark on an adventurous expedition to leave Lydia and find a new place to live. Those who stayed behind could use the existing resources to get through the famine. The people who left carried the burden of spreading and prospering civilization. This sounds crazy, isn't it? However, recent DNA evidence shows that the ancestors of the Roman Empire, the Iberians, and the Lydians have the same genes. Recently, scientists have discovered that Herodotus's crazy story is true in history. Geologists have also found evidence that indicates there was a global cooling period lasting for 20 years on Earth, which could explain the cause of this great famine. Therefore, this seemingly crazy story may be true. They preserved their culture through playing games and avoided reality for 18 years, and eventually it was passed down. They had long realized how to bring people together through games and saved the entire civilization through this way. We can also achieve this through gaming. People have been playing Warcraft since 1994, which was the first real-time strategy game in the Warcraft series, and that was 16 years ago. The ancient people played dice games for 18 years, while we have been playing Warcraft for 16 years. Therefore, I assert that we are ready to accept a game that can change our lives. The ancients used half of their civilization to explore new worlds, and we now have 21 billion hours of gaming time each week. Let half of us play games for one hour a day until we can go and solve the problems in real life. You might ask, "How can we solve real-world problems through gaming?" This is also why I have been actively involved in the work I do in the past few years. I work at the "Institute for the Future." This is an advertisement in our Palo Alto office, which gives our perspective on how to view the future. We will not try to predict the future, but we will create the future. We have envisioned the best possible outcomes and then tried to make people turn those visions into reality through hard work. We long for epic victories while also providing people with ways to achieve them. I want to briefly introduce three games that I have made. They are attempts to provide future generations with ways to create their own epic victories. This is "Oiligarchy." This game was created in 2007. It is an online game that challenges you to survive in a world experiencing an oil shortage. The oil shortage is fictional, but we put a lot of effort into making it seem real and affecting your real life. When you open the game and register, and tell us where you live, we provide you with real-time news, video data, and accurate information about the cost of oil, what is not available, how food supplies are affected, how transportation is affected, and whether schools are closed or riots are happening in certain places. If all of this seems real, you will figure out how to deal with these problems in real life. We will ask you to post these things on a blog, upload videos, or photos. In 2007, 1700 people participated in the testing of this game. We tracked the lives of these testers for the next three years, and I can tell you that it was a transformative experience. Nobody wants to change their lifestyle, either because they believe it is environmentally benign or because they believe it is the natural order of things. But if you immerse them in an extraordinary experience and tell them, "We have exhausted our oil," this will be a wonderful story and an extraordinary experience that you will hear about. Challenge yourself and see how you will survive. Most game players retain the habits they form in the game. In the next world-saving game, the choice we face is more difficult and greater than oil shortage. We created a game called "Superstruct" at the Institute for the Future. The assumption of this game is that the supercomputer has calculated that humans only have 23 years left to live on Earth. This supercomputer is called the Global Extinction Prediction System. In the game, people are like being in a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. Everyone knows Jerry Bruckheimer's movie, where you organize a dream team with an astronaut, a scientist, and a former criminal, each with their own ability to save the world. In our game design, we did not use a five-person team model. We designed it so that everyone can be a member of this elite team. Your responsibility is to develop future energy, food, healthcare, security systems, and a network of social security. We had 8,000 people play this game for 8 weeks, and they came up with 500 crazy but highly creative solutions. If you can go online and search for the keyword "Superstruct" on Google, you will see the results. The Last Game, which we will launch on March 3, is a collaboration with the World Bank Institute. If you can complete the game, you will receive certification from the World Bank Institute as a 2010 Social Innovator. Through our partnership with universities throughout sub-Saharan Africa, we are inviting them to participate in learning about social innovation. The game is more like a comic novel, with a balance of skills such as deep insight, knowledge networks, sustainability, foresight, and wit. I sincerely invite you to share this game with young people wherever they may be in the world, particularly in developing areas. This game can bring people together to begin imagining their own social enterprises to save the world. People can certainly gain inspiration from this game. I am about to end my speech, and I would like to ask a question: what will happen in the future? We have so many excellent gamers, and the games we play contain experiments of what we might do in the future. But nothing has ever saved the real world. I hope you can agree with my view that gamers are a huge human resource pool, and we can put them to work in the real world. Therefore, games are an effective platform for change. We possess these wonderful superpowers, the ability to produce happiness, the capability to organize a structured society, and the urgent optimism and desire for epic significance. I sincerely hope that we can come together and play these great games, so that we can continue to inhabit this planet in the next century. I hope that you can join us in creating or supporting such games. As I look forward to the next decade, I am very certain about two things. First, we can create any future we can imagine. Second, we can play any game we want to play. Let us use games to change the world. Thank you all.
For a considerable period of time, I have been interested in the power of placebos. Usually, a magician is not interested in placebos. But if you think about it from the perspective of my profession, it's about making false things seem real and convincing people of them so that they become facts. In other words, sugar pills have measurable effects in some studies, and the so-called placebo effect is precisely because people believe that they are experiencing a drug effect. Or to give another example, for pain relief, if a patient believes (that they are taking pain medication), the drug will have a noticeable effect on them. This is called the placebo effect. False things become real because of people's perception of them. In order for us to understand each other, I want to start by showing you a basic, simple magic trick. I will also tell you how I became a magician. This is a simple magic trick that has appeared in every child's magic book since the 1950s. I learned it from Boy Scouts magic in the 1970s. I will show it to you first, and then explain it. Finally, I will explain why I need to explain it. Look, it's magical how it changes like this. You can check this knife, and you can also check my hand. I held the knife in my fist like this. Then I rolled up my sleeve. At the same time, make sure that nothing can move up and down in my sleeve. I pressed down on my wrist like this. That way you can see that there's no time for anything to move. As long as I press down here, nothing can pass through my sleeve. The purpose of doing this is simple. I will open my palm and hope that, if everything goes well, my physiological magnetism will hold the knife. In fact, it sticks so tightly that I can even shake it and it won't fall. There's nothing in my sleeve, no trick. You can check everything. Okay! Applause. Well, this is a magic trick that I often teach to children who are interested in magic, because you can learn a lot about deception by learning this magic trick - even though it is a very simple trick in terms of method. It's very likely that many people in the audience know this magic trick. This is how it works: I hold this knife in my hand. I say that I'm going to hold onto my wrist to make sure nothing can come in or out of my sleeve, which is a lie. The reason I hold onto my wrist is the secret of this illusion. When my hand moves from facing you to facing away from you, this finger, my index finger, will move from here to this position pointing outward. Alright. There are many people over there who didn't have a childhood. Laughter My finger moves like this, from here, yes. As I rotate my hand, my finger also moves. We can talk about why this is deceptive, why you didn't notice that only three fingers were below here, because your consciousness, and the way we process consciousness, it doesn't count one, two, three. It combines them. But that's not what we're discussing today, right? So I'll open my palm again. Obviously it's pressed there, not by any physiological magnetism, but by deception, my index finger is there. I close my fingers again, and when I turn around, this action to some extent conceals the turning of my fingers. I remove this hand. You take this knife. You can do this trick to your friends and neighbors. Thank you. Now, what does this have to do with the placebo effect? About a year ago, I read a study that expanded my understanding. I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so it's a surprising thing for me. It showed that if you give a patient a placebo in the form of a white pill, like aspirin, if it's just a round white pill, it has a measurable placebo effect. But if you change the shape of the placebo you give, for example, you make it smaller, paint it blue, and engrave a letter on it, it will actually have a more noticeable measurable effect. Even if neither of them has any real therapeutic effect - they are both sugar pills. But why does the white pill not work as well as the blue one? This really confuses me. But in fact, that's not the end. If you use capsules, they are more effective than any form of pill. Colored capsules, with one end yellow and the other end red, are more effective than white capsules. Dosage plays a role. Taking one pill twice a day is not as effective as taking three pills. I can't remember the statistics now. I'm sorry. But the point is... Dosage is related to efficacy. The form of the drug is related to efficacy. If you want the maximum placebo effect, you need to inject it with a syringe. Right? An injector contains one or two milliliters of something that has no effect, and you inject it into a patient... In their mind, it's such a powerful imagination that it should be much stronger than a white pill. This is really a strong imagination, and when I have slides, I can show you a chart of statistical data. The point is, white pills are not as good as blue pills, capsules are better than pills, and injections are better than capsules. They don't have any real medicinal effect. It's just your belief that makes it real in your body and causes a stronger effect. I want to see if I can take this idea and apply it to magic tricks. Using some obviously fake tricks to make them look real. We know from research that if you want actual effects, you use injection. This is a seven-inch hypodermic needle. It's very sharp. I'll just sterilize it. This is my muscle. It's not Damien Hirst's special cut meat. This is my skin. It's not Hollywood special effects. I'm going to pierce my skin with this needle and push it all the way through to the other side. If you're squeamish or prone to fainting - and I've performed for some friends before, yesterday in the hotel, there were some people I didn't know, and a woman nearly fainted - so I suggest that if you're prone to being nervous, you might want to look away for the next 30 seconds. Actually, you know what, I'll do the bad part first. You'll see, you can look away if you want to. And, here it is, right here at the beginning of the flesh on my arm, at the lower part of my bicep, I've just made a little puncture. Sorry, did I frighten you? Just a little bit through my skin and out the other end. Now, we're basically in the same place as the knife trick. But now you can't count my fingers, can you? So let me show them to you. One, two, three, four, five. Yes, oh, I know what people are thinking when they see this. They say, "Oh, he must not be dumb enough to puncture his own skin for a few minutes of entertainment." So let me give you a sneak peek. How does that look? Good. Yeah, I know, some of you back there are saying, "Okay. I didn't really see that." People in the distant room can now move closer. Let me show you this carefully. This is really my skin. This is not Hollywood special effects. That's my flesh, and I can even rotate it. I'm sorry. If you feel sick, look elsewhere, not here. People in the back or years later watching this on video will say, "Oh, that looks a bit lacking in some effects, but if it were real, he would see there's a hole here, and there's a hole here, and if it were real, he would bleed. Let me bleed a little for you." Yes, that's it. Normally, at this point, I would remove the needle. I'll wash my arm and show you that I'm not injured. But I think in this case, with this philosophy of turning fake things into real things, I will stop here and step down from the stage. I will see you again in the next few days. I hope you are looking forward to it. Thank you very much.
I have come into contact with many fish in my life. Only two are my favorites. The first is born out of passion. It is a beautiful fish, delicious, with a delicate texture and rich flesh, and is the most popular fish on the menu. What a beautiful fish! Even better, it is bred to the highest standards, with the aim of maintaining its sustainability. And those who sell it also feel justified. I was once intoxicated by this beautiful relationship, which lasted for several months. One day, the company's top management called me and invited me to participate in an event and give a speech on the sustainable development of fisheries. I said, "Of course." This company is precisely trying to solve a problem that is becoming unimaginable for us chefs: "How do we keep fish on the menu?" In the past 50 years, we have fished from every ocean as if we were felling trees. Its destructive power cannot be overstated. 90% of large fish, the ones we love - tuna, halibut, salmon, swordfish - they're all going extinct. There are almost none left. So, whether we like it or not, aquaculture, fish farming, will be a part of our future. There are a lot of opinions about this industry. In fact, most of them are about how fish farming will pollute the environment and how inefficient it is, like with tuna. The biggest drawback is that the feed conversion rate for farmed tuna is 15:1. That means it takes 15 pounds of wild fish-based feed to produce one pound of tuna meat. That's not very sustainable. And it doesn't taste good either. Finally, this company wants to do something right. I also want to support them. The day before the event, I contacted the head of the company's public relations department. Let's call him "Mr. Tang" for now. I said, "Mr. Tang, as far as I know, the fact is that you are very famous in the marine fishing industry, and you won't cause pollution." He responded, "You're right. Our operation location is very far away, and the pollutants we generate from fishing are diluted and won't accumulate in one place." Then he added, "We can be considered unique. Feed conversion rate? 2.5:1," he said. "The best in the industry." 2.5 to 1, that's good. "What's 2.5 to 1? What are you feeding them?" He replied, "Sustainable protein." I said, "Great." And then I hung up. That night, I lay in bed thinking, "What the heck is sustainable protein?" So the next day, just before that event, I called Mr. Tang again. I asked, "Mr. Tang, do you have any examples of sustainable protein?" He said he didn't know, but he would ask around. Then I talked to some people in the company, but no one could give me a clear answer. Finally, I got on the phone with a biologist. Let's call him "Mr. Tang" for now. I said, "Mr. Tang, can you give an example of sustainable protein?" He mentioned some algae and some fish feed, and then he mentioned chicken balls. I asked, "Chicken balls?" He said, "Yes, feathers, chicken skin, bones, excrement, dried and added to feed." I said, "What proportion of the feed is chicken?" Think about it, you know, 2%. Then he said, "Well, it accounts for about 30%." I said, "Mr. Tang, what kind of sustainable development is it to feed fish with chicken?" The other end of the phone was quiet for a long time, and then he said to me, "There are just too many chickens in the world." So, I no longer loved this fish. No, it's not because I'm a self-righteous, hypocritical foodie. That's just who I am. No, I don't love this fish anymore because I swear to God, after that conversation, it tasted more like chicken. The second fish, on the other hand, is a different kind of love story. It's the romantic kind where the more you get to know your fish, the more you love it. I had this fish for the first time in a restaurant in the south of Spain. A journalist friend of mine had told me about it a long time ago. She could be considered a matchmaker. The fish was on the table, bright and glowing, white in color. The chef had cooked it for too long. It seems like it was cooked twice. But it was still delicious, which is amazing. Who can make such a delicious fish even when it's overcooked? I can't, but this person can. Let's call him Miguel. Actually, his name is Miguel. However, he did not cook that fish, and he is not a chef. At least, not in the way you and I understand it. He is a biologist in Veta la Palma. It is a fish farm located at the tip of the Guadalquivir River in southwestern Spain. Until the 1980s, the fish farm was run by Argentines. They used to raise cattle here, and at that time, this was basically a wetland. They drained the water and then built a series of complex canals to discharge the water into the river. However, they did not succeed, I mean economically. And it caused huge disasters to the surrounding environment. About 90% of the birds in the area disappeared, and there were many birds in this area. In 1982, an environmentally conscious Spanish company bought the land. What did they do? They reversed the direction of the water flow. They basically moved the dam. Instead of drainage, they used this canal to bring water in. They filled the canal with water. Then they established a 27,000-acre fish farm - sea bass, mullet, shrimp, eel - in this project, Miguel and this company completely rescued this ecological disaster. This fish farm is too amazing. I mean, you've never seen anything like it. I looked at the horizon, and it was so vast. What came into your view were the rivers filled with water and this rich marsh wetland. Not long ago, I went there with Miguel. He's an amazing person, ¾ Darwin and ¼ Crocodile Dundee. We entered the wetland, and I was panting and sweating, knee-deep in mud, and listening to Miguel's quiet biological lecture. Here, he pointed to a rare black-shouldered kite. He mentioned that there are planktons that can meet the mineral needs. And this, he saw a pattern that reminded people of the giraffes in Tanzania. As a result, Miguel spent a long time working in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. I asked him how he became a fish expert. He said, "Fish? I don't know about them. I'm just a relationship expert." Then he launched more conversations about rare birds and algae and special aquatic plants. Please don't get me wrong, such conversations are really fascinating, about things like biological communities. All of this is great, but I am in love. I always think of that fish that I tasted too much the night before. So I interrupted him and said, "Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?" He pointed to the algae. "I know, brother, algae, plankton, relationships, it's all very magical. But what do your fish eat? What's the feed conversion ratio?" Then he continued to tell me that it's a very rich system, and the fish eat what they eat in the wild. The biomass of plants, plankton, and zooplankton are all the feed for the fish. This system is very healthy and entirely self-renewing. No feed whatsoever. Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed animals? Later that day, Miguel and I were driving around the area, and I asked him, "In a place that looks so natural, unlike any other farm I've ever seen, how do you measure success?" Just then, as if a movie director had suddenly called for a change of scene, we rounded a bend and saw the most beautiful sight: thousands of flamingos, a pink carpet on the water. "That's success," he said. "Look at their bellies, pink. They're enjoying a feast." A feast? I was completely confused. "Miguel, isn't their feast your fish?" "Exactly," he said. "Birds eat up to 20% of our fish and eggs. And last year, this fish farm had 600,000 birds, over 250 different species. Today, it has become one of the largest and most important private bird sanctuaries in Europe. "Miguel, isn't having so many birds something a fish farm wouldn't want?" I shook my head. "We are in the broad sense of farming, not intentional. This is an ecological network. These flamingos eat shrimp. Shrimp eat zooplankton. So the brighter the pink on their bellies, the better the system." Okay, let's take another look. A farm that doesn't feed its animals and measures its success based on its natural predators. A fishery that is also a bird sanctuary. And, by the way, those flamingos shouldn't be there. They breed in the city and 150 miles away, where the soil is more suitable for nesting. Every morning, they fly 150 miles to this fishery. At night, they fly 150 miles back home. (Laughter) They do this because they can follow the white line of the A92 motorway. No kidding. I've been imagining something like The Emperor's New Groove in my head, and I looked at Miguel. I said, "Miguel, do they fly 150 miles to the fishery, and then fly 150 miles back at night for the children?" He looked at me as if I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song. He said, "No, they do it because the food is better here." I haven't mentioned my favorite fish skin yet, it's really delicious, and I usually don't like fish skin. I don't like it roasted or crispy. It has a spicy, tar-like taste. I never cook it with the fish. However, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain, it didn't taste like fish skin. It tasted slightly sweet and clean, like you had a taste of the ocean's natural flavor. I mentioned my thoughts to Miguel, and he nodded. He said, "The fish skin acts like a sponge. It's the last line of defense to prevent anything from entering the body." Its function is to absorb impurities." Then he continued, "But our water doesn't have any impurities." Okay. A fishing ground doesn't feed its fish. A fishing ground measures its success based on the success of its predators. Then I realized that when he said that there were no impurities in the fishing ground, he casually mentioned that the water flowing through the fishing ground came from the Guadalquivir River. That river contains everything that every river now has, chemical pollutants, pesticide residues. And when it leaves the system and exits, the water is cleaner than when it came. This system is hygienic and can filter the water here. So, this fishing ground is not just about not feeding animals, not just measuring its success based on the health of its predators, but it is basically a water purification plant, not just for those fish, but for you and me. Because when the water leaves here, it flows into the Atlantic. I know that this role is very small, but I value it, and you should too, because this love story is not only romantic but also educational. You might say that it is a recipe for the future of cuisine, whether we're talking about sea bass or beef. What we need now is a new agricultural concept, a true gastronomy. But for many, that's too extreme. We are not realists, we are gastronomes. We love the farmers market. We love small family farms. We talk about regional foods. We eat organic. And then when you suggest that these foods will guarantee the future of cuisine, someone in the room stands up and says, "Hey man, I love flamingos, but how are you going to feed the world with that? How are you going to feed the world?" Can I be frank? I don't like your question. No, not just because we are already producing far more calories than the world needs. Today, one billion people are still starving. This number is higher than ever before, and the root cause is an overall imbalance in distribution, not a lack of food in terms of tonnage. What I dislike about this problem is its underlying logic, which is based on a food system that has been in place for the past 50 years. This system involves feeding grain to grazing animals, using pesticides on monoculture crops, applying chemicals to the soil, feeding chicken to fish, and asking the question, "What's wrong with using cheaper methods to feed more people?" This is a motive, and it has become rationalized. It is a commercial plan belonging to American agriculture. We should point out its true face, a business that is being liquidated, a business that is rapidly eroding ecological capital. This is not a business, nor is it agriculture. Today, our food is being threatened not by declining supply, but by declining resources, not by the latest grafting technology and tractor inventions, but by fertile soil, not by water pumps, but by fresh water sources, not by chainsaws, but by forests, not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the ocean. Want to feed the world? Let's start asking: How do we feed ourselves? Or better yet, how do we create an environment where every community can feed itself? To do that, don't expect to use the current agricultural model in the future. It is outdated and exhausted because it relies too much on capital, chemicals, and machinery, and it cannot produce really good food. Instead, let's look at ecological models. They have existed for 2 billion years and have practical experience. Look at Miguel and farmers like him. Their farms are not just their own, they can self-recover instead of being depleted. The broad concept of farming replaces the narrow one, and farmers are no longer just producers but also relationship experts because they are experts in taste. And to be honest, they're better chefs than I am. You know, I completely agree with this, because if the future of good food is like this, it's definitely going to be very delicious. Thank you.
I grew up with the company of science fiction novels. In high school, I had to take an hour-long bus ride to and from school every day. During the long journey, I was always immersed in books, and those science fiction novels took my thoughts to other worlds, satisfying my strong curiosity in a narrative way. In addition, my curiosity was also displayed in other ways: whenever I didn't have classes, I would go to the woods to hike and collect "specimens", frogs, snakes, insects, pond water, everything was brought home and studied under a microscope. I was considered an extreme science enthusiast at the time. But all of this was to try to understand this world, to understand its possible boundaries. My love for science fiction novels is also in line with the world around me, as it was the late 1960s, and humans began to land on the moon and dive into the deep sea. Jacques Cousteau brought his amazing visual effects into our lives, presenting us with previously unimaginable animals, landscapes, and a wonderful world. All of this seemed to resonate with science fiction novels. At the same time, I am also an artist. I could draw and paint. I also found that because there were no electronic games, special effects movies, or massive visualizations in today's media industry, I had to create these images in my mind. I believe that as children, we all did the same thing. When we read, we often play in our minds what the author describes like a movie. My response to this was to depict extraterrestrial life, alien worlds, robots, spaceships, and so on. My scribbling behind textbooks was always caught by my math teacher. Therefore, I had to seek other outlets for my creativity. Interestingly, Jacques Cousteau's films surprised me, discovering that there was an alien world on this earth. Maybe I couldn't really go to an alien world in my lifetime by spacecraft. It sounded too far-fetched. But there is indeed a world on this earth that I can really go to - rich and strange, with everything I imagined through books. Therefore, when I was 15 years old, I decided to become a diver. The only problem was that at the time, I was living in a small village in Canada, and the nearest ocean was 600 miles away. But I wasn't discouraged by this. I pestered my dad until he found a diving school for me in Buffalo, New York, just across the border from Canada. I got my diving certificate in the swimming pool at the Christian Youth Center. But for the next two years, I didn't actually see the ocean with my own eyes, until we moved to California. In the 40 years since then, I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater, including 500 hours in a submersible. I've discovered that the deep sea, even in the shallows, is full of amazing life beyond our imaginations. Nature's imagination is boundless, far beyond our narrow human imagination. Even today, everything I've seen while diving still amazes me. My love for the ocean has always remained unchanged. But when I grew up and needed to choose a career, I chose film production. At the time, it seemed like the best way to combine my desire to tell stories with my desire to create images. When I was a child, I often drew cartoons, and film production allowed me to combine images and stories. It was a natural fit. Of course, the stories I told were all science fiction stories, like "The Terminator," "Aliens," and "The Abyss." In "The Abyss," I combined my love of the deep sea and diving with film production, bringing two passions together as one. "The Abyss" also brought about another inspiration: in order to better present the narrative of the film and create the liquid aquatic creatures in the movie, we began using computer animation technology. The film industry's first computer-generated soft-surface character was born as a result. Although the film did not perform well at the box office and barely broke even, I witnessed an amazing scene: the magic presented in the film deeply captivated audiences around the world. This is Arthur C. Clarke's law—that advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And what the audience witnessed at the time was exactly that kind of magic. It made me incredibly excited. I thought to myself, "Wow, this technology needs to be widely promoted in the art of film." So in my next film, "Terminator 2," we took this technology to a new level. Through collaboration with the Industrial Light & Magic special effects company, we created the liquid metal guy in the film. The success or failure of the film would depend on whether this technology worked or not. And it did work. We created magic once again. And we received the same feedback from the audience. Although the film's box office was a little better. Based on these two experiences, we realized that this would be a whole new world—a new world that allows film artists to unleash their imagination. So my good friend Stan Winston and I founded a company. Stan Winston was a well-known makeup artist and designer at the time. The company was called "Digital Domain," and its philosophy was to skip the analog process of optical printers and other techniques and move directly into digital production. In fact, we did achieve this, allowing us to take the lead for a period of time. However, in the mid-1990s, we realized that although our company's original intention was to excel in biological and character design, we were falling behind in this aspect. Therefore, I created the work "Avatar" with the aim of pushing visual effects and computer graphics to the limit, using computer animation to create creatures with genuine human emotions. The main characters and the entire scene would be made by computer. But I hit a wall. People in our company told me that we could not achieve such effects with the technology we had at the time. So I put the idea aside and instead made a movie about a ship sinking. At the time, I told the film company that the movie would be like "Romeo and Juliet" on the ship, a grand, romantic and passionate movie. But my true motive was to visit the wreckage of the Titanic. That was why I made the movie. I am telling the truth, although the film company was unaware of it at the time. I convinced them by saying, "We will dive into the wreck and shoot on location." As the opening of the film. This is crucial and very exciting." So I persuaded them to invest in this adventure. It sounded crazy, but ultimately it was about using your imagination to create a reality. In fact, six months later, we did create a reality. I was 2.5 miles underwater in the North Atlantic, in a Russian submersible, looking through a porthole at the real Titanic. Not a movie, not HD, but the real thing. The experience was mind-blowing. The preparation work was very cumbersome. We had to build cameras, lights, and so on. But what really amazed me was that deep-sea diving is like space exploration. Both are high-tech products that require meticulous deployment. You step into the cabin and enter this dark and dangerous environment. If you can't rely on your own strength to return, you have no chance of being rescued. I thought to myself, "Oh my God. I feel like I'm living in a science fiction movie. It's so cool!" Therefore, deep-sea exploration has become my new hobby. Of course, this is due to curiosity and science. It is a combination of all things, exploration of the unknown, boundless curiosity, and unlimited imagination, which is a rare experience that Hollywood cannot give me. Although I can imagine a creature and create it with computer effects, I cannot imagine everything I saw through the diving window that day. In our subsequent exploration process, I observed creatures living in hydrothermal vents, sometimes seeing things I had never seen before, sometimes seeing things that no one had seen before, and even witnessing things that had not been described by science before we saw them. Therefore, I was fascinated by it and had to continue. So I made a surprising decision. After the success of "Titanic", I decided, "Okay, my career in Hollywood filmmaking can come to a close here. In the coming period, I want to become a full-time explorer." And so, we began planning these exploration activities. We went to explore the wreck of the Bismarck, using robotic devices to probe its remains. We then returned to the remains of the Titanic and created a batch of robots that could wrap around optical fibers. The purpose was to delve deep into the wreck and explore its interior – an unprecedented approach. Before this, no one had seen the inside of the wreck. They did not have the necessary technology, so we created the appropriate technology. You see, at the time, I was on the deck of the Titanic, sitting in a submersible, looking at the wooden deck and thinking about the band that had played here. I operated a small robotic explorer that flew through the corridors of the ship. Although I was controlling it, my mind was inside this explorer. I felt like I was really inside the wreckage of the Titanic. It was the most incredible sense of deja vu that I had ever experienced because, before the robot's detection light illuminated everything around me, I already knew everything hidden behind each corner. The reason for this was that during the movie production process, I spent many months walking around this scene. The props in the studio were made to resemble the actual ship's design. So, that experience was extraordinary. It made me feel like I had undergone a kind of remote viewing experience - we even had avatars in the shape of these robots, into which we injected our thoughts and consciousness, injecting them into another form of existence. It was a truly profound experience. Perhaps all of this can give us an idea of what the world might be like in a few decades. As a science fiction fan, I can imagine various futures for post-human societies, using semi-mechanical beings for exploration and other activities. So, through these explorations, I began to truly appreciate the beauty of the ocean floor, such as the amazing creatures that live near deep-sea vents. They can be considered alien life on Earth. They live in a chemically synthesized environment, completely independent of the sun's light that we need to survive. So, when you see the animals living around the 500-degree hotspots on the ocean floor, You think they couldn't possibly survive. At the same time, I became interested in space technology, which was also influenced by science fiction when I was young. As a result, I established a close relationship with the space community and worked with NASA, becoming a member of their advisory committee, planning real space missions, visiting Russia, participating in biological science agreements before visiting astronauts, and so on, so that we could bring our 3D filming equipment to the International Space Station. This experience was unforgettable. But in the end, what I did was convince space scientists to follow us into the depths of the ocean, so that they could experience it for themselves. Space biologists, astroscientists, and others interested in extreme environments were brought to the deep-sea vents to observe, collect samples, and use detection instruments. So while we were making documentaries, we were also studying science and space science. I connected my experiences as a science fiction fan in my youth with my real work in this industry. On this journey of exploration, I also learned a lot. I learned a lot about science, but I also learned a lot about leadership. You think that a director must be a leader, a helmsman, and so on. But before these expeditions, I knew nothing about leadership. Because I always had to ask myself: "What am I doing? Why am I doing these things? What do I get out of it?" These damn documentaries don't make any money. We hardly ever break even. No recognition, no pay. Many people thought that after the movies "Titanic" and "Avatar," I just retreated to the beach to get a manicure. But in fact, I produced these movies, these documentaries, which only a handful of viewers have seen. No recognition, no pay, no money. What are you doing? I did all of this for the value of the experience itself, for the challenge - and the ocean is the most challenging environment. I did all of this to explore and discover the sense of wonder, and for that incredible cohesion that occurs when a small group of people come together as a team. You believe that a director must be a leader, a commander, and so on. But before these explorations, I knew nothing about leadership. Because ultimately, I had to ask myself: "What am I doing? Why am I doing these things? What do I get out of it?" These damn documentaries don't make any money. It's not easy to break even. No fame, no recognition. Many people think that between "Titanic" and "Avatar," I retreated to the background and sat on the beach, painting my nails. But in fact, I made these movies and documentaries, which only a small number of people have seen. No fame, no recognition, no money. What are you doing? I do all this for the value of the experience itself, for the challenge - and the ocean is the most challenging environment. I do all this to explore and discover the sense of wonder, and for the incredible cohesion that emerges when a small group of people come together as a tight-knit team.Because each time, we work with 10 to 12 people for a few years. Sometimes we have to stay at sea for 2-3 months. And in that kind of cohesion, you realize that the most important thing is the respect between you and them, and that you have completed a task that cannot be explained to others. When you return to the shore, you say, "We need to do this, this fiber optics, this electrical attenuation, and this and that." The technical aspects, the difficulty, and the efficiency of the work at sea - these are things you can't explain to others. It's like those police officers and soldiers who have suffered together. They know that they can't explain their experiences to others. Create cohesion, create a cohesive respect. So when I came back to make my next film, "Avatar," I tried to apply the same leadership principles - respect your team, and they will turn around and respect you. And this principle has indeed changed the vitality of the team. Once again, I walked with a small team to an unknown area to create new technologies that had never existed before. It was inspiring, challenging, and in four and a half years, we became a big family. This experience completely changed the way I make movies. People commented that you brought underwater creatures back into people's view and placed them on the planet Pandora. For me, it is more about the basic principles of doing things and the process itself, which changes the outcome of things. So what did we get from all of this? What did we learn? I think the first point is curiosity. This is the most powerful thing you have. Imagination is a force, a force that can reflect reality. And the respect your team has for you is more important than all the other laurels in the world. Sometimes young film directors ask me, "Give me some advice on filmmaking." My answer is, "Don't limit yourself. Others will come and limit you, they'll set boundaries for you, but you shouldn't limit yourself. Don't bet on losing. Dare to take risks." The FAA has a saying they like very much: "Failure is not an option." But in art and exploration, failure is definitely an option, because both require the confidence to take risks. No important struggle for innovation is accomplished without risk. You have to be willing to take those risks. And that's the enlightenment I want to leave you with: no matter what you do, failure is one of the options, but fear is not. Thank you.
If today I could leave you with one idea, it is that the information contained in all the data we consume is greater than the sum of its parts. Rather than thinking about information overload, I hope you consider how to use this information, to reveal patterns and make visible the unseen trends. Here, we see a typical mortality chart, grouped by age. The tool I am using here is a small experiment called Pivot. With Pivot, I can filter for specific causes of death, like accidents. Immediately, I see a different pattern emerge because people are most active in the middle of their lives but also most vulnerable to illness. If we reorganize the data by cause of death, we see that cardiovascular disease and cancer are the leading causes of death, but this pattern does not apply to everyone. If we filter by age, such as under 40, we see that accidents become a much more dangerous killer. And if we dig deeper, we find this is especially true for men. So, you see the power of this tool. It allows us to explore data as if we were swimming in a sea of living information. If we can do this with raw data, why not also do it with content? Therefore, we're showing here every cover of Sports Illustrated ever published, all of them available online. You can try it in your room after my talk. Using Pivot, you can look at the covers by decade. You can drill down to a specific year. You can jump straight to a particular issue. For example, I see this one and I see an athlete, sports. I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, so I keep clicking and it shows me all the covers with Lance Armstrong. (Applause) Now, if I just want to sample the high points of this data, I might say, OK, show me all the covers with cyclists. So, I can back up a bit and zoom in on that. I now see Greg Raymond, so you should understand that when you browse information in this way, narrow, wide, backward, and reverse, you are not searching, not browsing. What you are doing is actually a bit different. It is in between the two, and we believe that this changes the way information is used. Therefore, I deduce that there is something a bit crazy about this idea. What we are doing here is extracting pages from each Wikipedia and compressing them into a small summary that includes an introduction and an icon indicating that it comes from a professional field. I am only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages here, but even in these limited views, we can still do a lot. Immediately, we learned what is most popular on Wikipedia. I continue and select the government. Now, with the selected government, I can see that the most common category in Wikipedia corresponds to Time Magazine's Person of the Year. This is important because it is something that is not covered on any one Wikipedia page. Only by stepping back and looking at the bigger picture can you gain a deeper understanding. Look at one of these special summaries, and then I can delve deeper into Time Magazine's Person of the Year and learn more about them. So, looking at these people, I can see that most of them come from the government, some from the natural sciences, and fewer from the business world. One of them is my boss, one comes from the music industry, and interestingly, Bono is also a TED Prize winner. So we can continue, jump, and see all the TED Prize winners. You see, this is our first time traveling on the web, as if it is indeed a net, not just page by page, but at a higher abstract level. So I want to tell you something else that may surprise you. I am now showing you the New York Times website. Pivot, this application—I don't want to call it a browser, it's really more than a browser—you can use it to browse web pages—and we've introduced scalable technology for every web page like this. And we've introduced scalable technology for every web page like this. So I can zoom out, zoom out to a specific place. And why this is important is because, due to the benefits of browsing the web in this way, I can see all of my browsing history in exactly the same way. So I can delve into specific events in specific time periods. Here, in fact, is the case for all of my presentations just now. I can somewhat replay what I saw earlier today. If I want to step back and see everything, I can slice my history, maybe my search history. Here, I did some related searches, searching Bing, here's Pivot from Microsoft Live Labs. From these, I can delve into web pages and simply restart them. It's the same information used multiple times for different purposes, each time recombining, making it contain more information than the whole combined. Each time recombining, making it contain more information than the whole combined. Nowadays, when we talk about data, we often mention the curse of it. We talk about the curse of information explosion. We talk about drowning in the sea of information. What if we could overturn this concept and turn the network upside down? Instead of linking single-line information, let's get used to linking diverse information and then see hidden patterns that cannot be seen in any other way. If we can do this, instead of being trapped in data, we can truly obtain information. And not just process information, we can also sort out knowledge. If we gain knowledge, we can even discover wisdom. Thank you.
Recently, everyone has been talking about happiness. In the past five years, I asked people to count how many books mention "happiness" in their titles, and they counted around 40, with many more not counted. More and more researchers are becoming interested in the topic of happiness, and there are many "happiness coaches" teaching others to be happier. Although there are many of these jobs, there are still several cognitive traps that make it difficult for people to understand the essence of happiness. Today I will mainly talk about these cognitive traps. These traps not only affect the general perception of one's own happiness, but also affect scholars' judgments of happiness, because no one is perfect, and we all make mistakes. The first trap is the unwillingness to admit the complexity of happiness. The fact is that the word "happiness" is no longer a common word, as we have used it to explain too many things. I think we should limit its meaning, but in general, we have to give up this idea and use a more complex perspective to look at what constitutes a happy life. The second trap is the confusion between experience and memory: basically, this is the difference between experiencing happiness in life and feeling that life is happy and satisfied. These two meanings are far apart and are often confused when discussing happiness. The third trap is the focusing illusion. Unfortunately, in any situation, when we think of some scenarios about a happy life, we inevitably feel that they are especially important. My point is that this is a real cognitive trap. It is unavoidable. Now, I would like to start with an example. A person who attended my class once told me a story during a Q&A session. [unclear...] He said that he once listened to symphony music and found it really beautiful, but at the end of the performance, there was a piercing and grating sound. Then he excitedly said that a mouse had spoiled the broth. But that was not the case. The bad impression that occurred was only a memory of that experience. "He went through this experience. He also experienced a 20-minute auditory extravaganza. But now they are all insignificant because he only remembers one thing - the bad memory, while the other 20 minutes of the extravaganza are completely forgotten. This tells us that when we think about ourselves and others, we use two selves. The first is the experiential self, which lives in the present, observes the present, and can also reminisce about the past, but basically belongs only to the present. The self that doctors generally deal with is the experiential self - as when a doctor asks you, "Does it hurt when I touch you here?" The other self is the remembering self, which is responsible for recording life and writing life stories. When a doctor wants to talk to him, he will ask questions like "How have you been feeling lately?" or "Is Albania fun to visit?" The experiential self and the remembering self are completely different, and the confusion between the two is part of the reason why we don't understand happiness. The remembering self is responsible for telling stories." The story is extracted directly from memory - uploaded in real-time. It's not that we are telling the story we want to tell. It's our memory that tells the story, and it's the story we've stored from experience. Let me start with an example. This is an old study. Some real patients will receive a painful treatment. The details are not elaborated. Today's therapy is no longer so painful, but in the 1990s when the study was conducted, this method was excruciatingly painful. The patients had to report their pain index every sixty seconds. Here are the records of two patients. I ask you, "Who is in more pain between them?" This question is simple. Obviously, it is Patient B. His colonoscopy took longer, and the pain that Patient A felt per minute was also felt by Patient B and lasted longer. But now there is another question: did these patients suffer? Here is a little surprise: surprisingly, Patient A had a worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. The stories of the two colonoscopies are different, and the key is the ending of the stories-- neither story is very enlightening-- but they are obviously different... One of them obviously felt worse than the other. The one who felt worse knew what excruciating pain was in the final period. This is not a good story. How do we know? Because we asked them after the examination ended and asked them again a long time later, "What is your overall impression of the colonoscopy?" The result is that Patient A's memory feels significantly worse than Patient B's. Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. From the perspective of the experiencing self, Patient B is obviously more uncomfortable. So how can we explain Patient A's situation? We actually did a clinical trial. When the experiment was completed, we also got the expected results. In fact, we could extend Patient A's examination time to slow down the vibration of the catheter. Although the patient still feels pain, it has been greatly relieved. If you continue like this, you will make Patient A's experience self feel worse, but Patient A's remembering self will feel much better because you gave Patient A a better story, a better memory of his painful experience. How do we define the quality of a story? And the story that memory tells us is real, and the story we tell is also true. The quality of the story depends on the climax and the ending. The ending is very important, and the above story is dominated by the ending. Now, the experiencing self continues this life experience. He also has moments of experience, one after another. You may ask, "What happened to these moments?" The answer is simple. They have disappeared forever. Most of the moments in our lives - I counted - are only three seconds long from a psychological perspective. This means that there are about 600 million moments in a person's life. In a month, there are about 600,000 moments. Most of them leave no trace. Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self. However, you should now also realize that some feelings are stored, because every minute and every second in our experience combine to form our life. As long as we are alive, we will consume these limited resources. How to use them seems to be important, but this is not the story left to us by the remembering self. Therefore, the remembering self and the experiencing self are easily distinguishable. The biggest difference between them is the way they handle time. As for the experiential self, if you have a vacation where the second week is just as happy as the first week, then the total amount of happiness over the two weeks is more than twice that of a one-week vacation. However, it is not calculated the same way for the remembering self. For the remembering self, a two-week vacation is not much different from a one-week vacation because no new memories are added during the period. The plot of the story remains the same. Therefore, time is a key factor in distinguishing between the remembering self and the experiential self. Time has little effect on the story. What the remembering self does is not just memory and storytelling, but it is also the real factor in making decisions. For example, if your patient has had two different surgeons perform a gastrointestinal endoscopy, and now they must choose one of them to perform another examination, the patient will choose the one they remember feeling better with. That's how they choose their doctor. The experiential self has no say in making choices. In fact, we don't make choices between two experiences. We make choices between memories of two different experiences. And when we imagine the future, we generally don't think in terms of experiences. We present the future in the form of anticipated memories. In general, you can see that the memory self is totalitarian. You can imagine the memory self pulling the experience self by using the experiences that the experience self does not want. I have an idea that when we take vacations, a large part of it is for the memory self. I think this is a bit difficult to reconcile. How much of our memory have we used? This can explain why the memory self can become the dominant self. This reminds me of a vacation, which was spent in Antarctica several years ago. This can be said to be my best vacation, and compared to other vacations, I often think about this one. This journey probably took up about three weeks of my memory, but only about 25 minutes in the past four years. Now, if I open the folder with about 600 photos, I may spend an hour reminiscing. The three-week journey takes no more than an hour and a half to reminisce. This seems disproportionate. This makes me a little dissatisfied because I remember so little, but even if you remember more, there is still a practical problem here. Why do we use more memory than we rely on experience? So I hope you can think about an experiment related to thinking. Suppose on your next vacation, when you know that all the photos from your vacation will be destroyed when the vacation ends, and you will also take a pill to forget everything. Will you still want to experience the same vacation? If you choose a different vacation, there will be conflicts between your two selves, and you will have to come up with ideas to resolve this conflict. This is not easy, because if you only consider time, you will get one answer. But if you only consider memory, you will get another answer. Why do we choose this instead of that? This is a problem that troubles us and requires us to make a choice between our two selves. Now, the two selves bring two different views of happiness. These two views of happiness correspond to the two selves. So you might ask, "How happy is the self of experience?" Then you will ask, "How happy is every moment of the self of experience?" The process of composing these happy moments is extremely complex. How should emotions be measured? By the way, we now have a rough idea that the experiential self will feel happy as time goes by. But the happiness referred to by the memory self is completely different. This is not a question of how happy a person's life is, but a question of how satisfied and how much one likes one's own life. Completely different views. If these two views cannot be distinguished, one cannot understand the science of happiness. Like other well-lived students, I have been unable to understand happiness all along because of this reason. In recent years, the difference between the happiness of the experiential self and the satisfaction of the memory self has been clarified, and efforts are currently being made to measure the two separately. Gallup recently conducted a public opinion poll around the world, in which more than 500,000 people were asked a similar question, that is, how they view their lives and experiences. In addition to this question, the company has done other surveys. In recent years, we have gradually learned information about the two types of happiness perspectives. I believe the main thing we have learned is that they are vastly different. Although you can find out whether a person is satisfied with their life, you cannot tell how happy they are on a day-to-day basis, and vice versa. Just to give you a basic idea of their correlation, they are only about 50% correlated. This means that when you are told someone's father is six feet tall, can you know how tall that person is? Well, you might have a basic idea, but you are not sure. You cannot make a judgment. If I say someone rates their own quality of life as 8/10, you cannot be sure how happy their experiential self is. So the correlation is very low. We know what can satisfy people's happiness. Money is important, goals are important, and we know that we need to be with the people we love and spend time with them to be happy. Although there are other factors, this is the main one. So if you want both selves to be happy, you must abandon old habits and do something different. I mean, we should not at least equate happiness with living well. These two are completely different. Now, let's quickly discuss another reason why we cannot understand the essence of happiness, that is, how we see life and how we live life are different. So when you ask someone in California how happy they are, you will not get the right answer. Because when you ask this way, you assume that Californians must be happier than you, who live in Ohio. When you think about how happy it is to live in California, you will think about the differences between California and other states, such as the climate. It has been proven that climate conditions are not very important for the experiential self and not very important for evaluating how happy we are with our thinking self. However, since reality is dominated by our thinking self, some people may come to the conclusion that moving to California is the solution. It will be quite interesting to track and observe their subsequent development. Their experiential self will not become happier. We all know this. But after something happens, they will feel much happier because when they think about it, they will remember the bad weather in Ohio. They also feel that they have made the right decision. It is really difficult to understand how to live a happy life, and I hope that I have given you a basic understanding of this process and how difficult it is. Thank you. Chris Anderson: Thank you for your speech. I have a question for you. Thank you very much for your talk. A few weeks ago, we had a phone conversation and you mentioned an interesting phenomenon you found from Gallup's survey. Can you share it with us? We still have a few minutes left.Daniel Kahneman: Sure. I found a very interesting number from the Gallup survey that was quite surprising. We found a phenomenon about the happiness of the experiencing self. That is, people's feelings vary depending on how much income they have. The results showed that for Americans with an annual income of less than $60,000, which accounted for a large proportion of the sample, almost 600,000 people, these people were quite indicative. Those earning less than $60,000 a year were unhappy, and the lower their income, the unhappier they were. When the income exceeded $60,000, we obtained a standard level line. It's rare to see such a flat line. Obviously, money can't buy happiness for the experiential self, but no money can indeed bring you a state of sadness, and we measured the degree of pain very clearly. As for another self, the remembering self, you have a completely different story. The more you earn, the more satisfied you are. This has nothing to do with emotions. Anderson: But, Danny, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are the goals that all Americans strive for. If everyone takes this discovery seriously, then it will overturn our inherent ideas, such as tax policies, etc. Is it possible for the politicians of this country to face such discoveries and govern accordingly? Kahneman: I think some people have realized the importance of studying happiness in planning policies. However, this awareness is spreading slowly in the United States, which is unquestionable, but in the UK, it is fermenting, and other countries are the same. The general public has also begun to realize that happiness should be included in the consideration index when planning policies. Although this will take some time, people will also start thinking. What they want is experiential happiness or a score for life, so we will soon understand this issue. There are several ways to enhance happiness, but it depends on what you are thinking, whether you are thinking of the memory self or the experiential self. I think in a few years, this will affect policy implementation. The United States has made huge efforts to measure the experiential happiness of the masses. I think in ten or twenty years, this will become part of the national statistical data. Anderson: This issue will be the most important policy discussion issue for me in the next few years. Thank you very much for creating behavioral economics. Thank you very much, Daniel Kahneman.
Today I want to talk about energy and climate, which may be a bit unexpected. After all, my full-time work at the foundation is mainly about inventing and spreading things related to disease vaccines and agricultural seeds, which are things that need to be improved to benefit the poorest two billion people in the world. But in fact, energy and climate are extremely important to these people, even more so than to other people on Earth. The continuing deterioration of the climate means that their crops will not be able to grow for years, and will lead to floods or droughts, making their fragile environment unable to withstand the changes. This will lead to famine, unrest, and social turmoil. Therefore, climate change will have serious consequences for them, and energy prices are also crucial to them. In fact, if you could only reduce the price of one thing to reduce poverty, you would definitely choose energy prices. Energy prices have gradually declined throughout human history, and advanced civilizations are built on advanced energy. The coal revolution of the past pushed forward the industrial revolution. As early as the beginning of the 20th century, we experienced a rapid drop in electricity prices, which is why we are able to enjoy refrigerators and air conditioners. Thanks to electricity, we are able to have various modern conveniences and do various things. However, when we further lower electricity prices, such as by making them twice as cheap, we face a new constraint, which is related to carbon dioxide. The current massive emissions of carbon dioxide will cause a rise in temperature, which will lead to a series of very serious consequences, such as direct effects on the weather and indirect effects on the ecosystem. The ecosystem cannot cope with drastic changes, resulting in a comprehensive collapse of the ecosystem.The relationship between the increase in carbon dioxide emissions and temperature rise, as well as the positive feedback effect between the two, are uncertain, but not many. As for how severe the specific negative impacts of global warming will be, it cannot be fully determined, but it is certainly extremely severe. I have consulted top scientists on this matter many times: Do we really have to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero? Can't we reduce them by half or a quarter? Their answer is that unless we reduce them to zero, temperatures will continue to rise, which will be a huge challenge. Their response was that unless we reduce to zero, temperatures will continue to rise, which will be a huge challenge. This is different from making a 12-foot tall truck pass through a 10-foot bridge by finding a way to squeeze through. CO2 emissions must be completely reduced to zero. Currently, we emit a large amount of CO2 every year, totaling over 26 billion tons. Americans emit about 20 tons per capita, while poor countries emit less than one ton per capita, and the global per capita emission is about 5 tons. Regardless, we must make changes until this number drops to zero. This number is still rising, and only economic fluctuations slightly suppress its upward trend. We must not only reverse its rapid rise but also make it drop and all the way to zero. The CO2 formula has four factors that multiply together. The left side of the equation is the amount of CO2 emissions, and our goal is to reduce it to zero. CO2 emissions = total population x per capita service usage x average energy consumption per unit of service x CO2 emissions per unit of energy. Let's go through each factor one by one and see how we can ultimately reduce the equation to zero. Obviously, we need at least one factor to be very close to zero, which is simple high school algebra. First, let's look at the population. Currently, there are 6.8 billion people in the world, and this will continue to grow to about 9 billion people. If we are effective in our work in new vaccine development, medical services, and reproductive health, this number could be reduced by 10% to 15%, resulting in a comprehensive growth rate of about 1.3. The second factor is the services we use, including everything from the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the TV we watch, and the heating we use. These are all very good things. Getting rid of poverty means providing these services to everyone on earth, and it would be a good thing for this factor to further increase. Getting out of poverty means providing these services to everyone on earth. Further increases in this factor are a good thing. In developed countries, the wealthiest billion people may be able to control consumption and reduce some service enjoyment. However, overall, this number will continue to rise, and the services enjoyed per capita will double or more. In this region, the services we enjoy are very basic. Do you have a lighting system at home to do your homework? These children don't have one, so they have to go outside and sit under streetlights to do their homework. The next factor is efficiency, or the energy consumed by each service. Here, we have some good news: this factor will not continue to rise. Through various inventions and new lighting methods, new technologies for cars, and new building methods, we can greatly reduce the energy consumed by many services. For some services, the reduction can even be as much as 90 percent. However, for other services, such as fertilizer production and air transport, the room for improvement is relatively limited. Therefore, the optimistic estimate for this factor is that we may achieve a three to six-fold decrease overall. In terms of the three factors we have discussed, the most we can reduce emissions is from 260 tons to 13 billion tons, which is still far from enough. Finally, let's look at the fourth and most critical factor, which is the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of energy. Our problem is, can this factor really be reduced to zero? Burning coal and gas are definitely not an option. All of our current methods of generating electricity produce CO2, except for renewable energy and nuclear energy that are still in development. Therefore, we need to establish a new system on a global scale, and we need an energy miracle. Although I used the word "miracle," it doesn't mean that it's impossible. Microprocessors are a miracle, personal computers are a miracle, and the internet and its applications are also a miracle. "Microprocessors are a miracle, personal computers are a miracle, and the internet and its applications are also a miracle. This means that all of you here have witnessed or even participated in the occurrence of many miracles. Generally speaking, we don't set a deadline for miracles to happen. Usually, you just stand by and some miracles happen, while others don't. But when it comes to low-carbon emission reduction, we must make every effort to promote it and achieve this miracle before the final deadline. I wonder how I can better present this issue? Is there a natural and vivid expression? Is there a presentation that can stimulate people's imagination? I remember bringing some mosquitoes here a year ago, and everyone seemed to like them. Mosquitoes made the participants at that meeting truly realize that there are people in the world who live with mosquitoes. So, since we are talking about energy today, I thought of bringing this: fireflies." I have decided that releasing fireflies will be my contribution to the environment here this year. These are a few natural fireflies, which are said to not bite people. Maybe they are too lazy to come out of that jar. While there are many innovative ideas like using fireflies to solve energy problems, their practical impact is quite limited. What we need are solutions - one or many - that are highly scalable and reliable. Although people are exploring various options, I think there are only five directions that can make a significant impact at present. I did not include contributions from tidal, geothermal, fusion, and biofuels, which will all make some contributions. If they perform better than expected, it's even better. But the key is that we must invest heavily in these five ways and not give up because they seem challenging since they all contain severe challenges. First, let's take a look at fossil fuels, such as burning coal or gas. What we need to do, while it sounds simple, is not so simple. The measure we need to take is to collect all the carbon dioxide produced by combustion through the chimney, then compress, liquefy, and store it while ensuring no leakage. Current experiments can achieve 60% to 80% levels, but reaching 100% will be very difficult. Moreover, storing such a large amount of carbon dioxide in one place can easily spark controversy. The most challenging aspect is that this is a long-term problem. Who can guarantee it? These waste materials have a volume one billion times that of other nuclear waste and other waste products. Who can ensure long-term safety? These waste materials have a volume one billion times that of other nuclear waste and other waste products. Who can guarantee long-term safety? The amount of carbon dioxide is very large, so it will be very difficult. Next, nuclear energy also has three major problems. Its cost, especially in highly regulated countries, is very high. Safety is also a big issue, ensuring everything is orderly even with manual operation, and ensuring that nuclear fuel will not be used as a weapon. There is also the issue of how to deal with nuclear waste, although the amount is not large, there are many concerns. A good solution must make people feel at ease. These are three difficult but possibly solvable problems, so we need to continue to work hard. I will combine the last three of the five types of energy to discuss together. These are the three types of energy that people usually refer to as renewable energy. In fact, although they do not require fuel, they also have their shortcomings. First, the energy density collected by these technologies is far lower than that of power plants. This is energy agriculture, and its scale is measured in square kilometers, several thousand times larger than conventional power plants. Moreover, these energy sources are intermittent. The sun is not available all day, nor is it available every day. Similarly, wind is not always blowing. If we rely entirely on these sources, we will still need other channels to obtain energy to get through the intermittent periods. Therefore, we face huge cost issues and challenges in transmission. For example, if an energy source is located overseas, you not only need energy technology but also need to deal with the risks associated with the energy not being domestically available. Finally, there is the issue of storage. To make this issue more concrete, I carefully studied all existing batteries, including those used in cars, computers, phones, flashlights, and all other devices that use batteries. I compared their stored energy capacity to the world's daily energy consumption and found that all the batteries we currently manufacture can store only enough energy for less than 10 minutes. Therefore, in reality, we need a major breakthrough and a solution that is 100 times better than current technology. This is not impossible, but it won't be easy. With such a breakthrough, we could use intermittent energy sources to provide 20%-30% of the energy needed. However, if you want to depend on it 100%, you need a very efficient miracle battery. So, how do we move forward? Where is the right way? Is this going to be a Manhattan Project? How do we get to the other side? We need many companies to work together, hundreds of them. For each of the five methods, we need teams of at least 100 people, many of whom you may think are crazy, and that's right. I believe that many people on the TED team have already begun to devote themselves to this. Bill Gates has several companies, one of which is called eSolar, with excellent solar thermal technology. Vinod Khosla has invested in dozens of companies, their work is great, and they have proposed interesting possibilities. I also plan to support their projects. In fact, Nanshan Zhuhaiworld and I are already supporting a company, which may be a bit surprising, but this company is in the nuclear energy field. Although there have been some small innovations in nuclear energy in recent years, such as modularization and the use of liquid fuel, innovation in this industry has actually stopped for some time. Therefore, it is not surprising that some good ideas are emerging now. Terrapower's idea is not to burn conventional uranium U235, but to burn the remaining 99%, namely U238. This is a somewhat crazy idea, but people have been discussing it for a long time and have not been able to simulate whether it is feasible or not. With the continuous upgrading of modern supercomputers, we can now simulate this, and it can be foreseen that this solution is feasible as long as the right materials are used. Moreover, because we are burning the 99% nuclear waste that was previously discarded, costs can be greatly reduced. You're actually turning waste into fuel. It's great news that we no longer have to worry about how to deal with the waste from all existing nuclear reactors. This technology is like a candle, gradually burning up uranium waste. The process is known as a wave reactor and the fuel problem is solved. This is a waste site in Kentucky. This is that waste, that 99%. This is the spent fuel, or depleted uranium, from which hundreds of years of power can be generated for the entire United States. In addition, the fuel obtained simply through a low-cost seawater filtration program would be sufficient for the use of the entire planet for the next half century. As you can see, there will be many challenges ahead, but this is just one example out of hundreds of methods that we need to continue to push forward. Think about how we should measure our achievements. How many points should we give ourselves on our report card? Let's first look at our ultimate goal and then work backwards to our mid-term goals. Many people are talking about an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. This is truly important, and we must achieve this goal. The remaining 20% should be the share of poor countries, such as some agricultural countries. Hopefully, by then, we will have already cleaned up the logging and cement industries. Therefore, to achieve this 80%, developed countries, as well as countries like China, need to change their electricity generation methods together. The next level is whether we have deployed zero-emission technologies. Have we adopted this technology in all developed countries and are we promoting it to other regions? This is a crucial factor in delivering an excellent answer. Looking back from 2050, what should our score be in 2020? Well, there are two parts to it. We should carefully examine the standards for measuring efficiency to begin reducing emissions. The less we emit, the less total carbon dioxide there will be, and the lower the temperature will be. But from another perspective, the achievements we made in 2020 by doing some emission reductions, but not significant ones, are only equivalent to, or less important than, the breakthrough innovations that bring about key changes. We need to achieve these technological breakthroughs at full speed. We can measure them by the number of participating companies, experimental projects, or changes in regulatory policies. There are many good books on this topic, such as Al Gore's "Our Choice" and David Mackay's "Sustainable Energy - without the hot air". They have carefully studied and constructed a framework for this issue to facilitate widespread discussion. Because we need broad support and multi-party cooperation for this issue. This is a wish. To invent this technology is a very specific and practical wish. If I could make one wish for the next 50 years, I could choose to have someone become president, or choose a vaccine, which is something I love, or choose energy, inventing a technology that would halve the price of energy and have zero emissions. I would definitely choose energy. This would have the greatest impact. If we cannot achieve this wish, there will be great differences between people considering short-term and long-term goals, between the United States and China, and between poor and rich countries. Most of the lives of the two billion poorest people will greatly deteriorate. So what must we do? I implore you to participate in promoting what exactly we should do. We should increase research funding. At meetings such as Copenhagen, countries should not only discuss carbon dioxide reduction schedules, but also innovation schedules. The low investment in these innovative methods will definitely shock you. We do need some market incentives, such as carbon taxes, quotas, and trading, to send price signals. We need to get the information out. We should make this dialogue more rational and easier to understand, including the measures taken by the government. This is an important wish, and I think it is a wish that can be realized. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Moderator: Thank you, thank you, thank you. I have a better understanding of Terrapower now. First, can you give us a rough idea of the scale of this investment? Bill Gates: If we just buy supercomputers, develop software, and hire excellent scientists, which we've already done, it will cost only a few tens of millions. We even went to Russia to test our materials in a reactor to see if they could work. Altogether, it costs only a few hundred million. The most challenging part is building the test reactor, raising tens of billions of dollars, finding managers, and selecting a site. Only then can we build the first nuclear power plant of this kind. Once you build the first one, if it is indeed as useful as claimed, everything becomes straightforward because its economics and energy density are completely different from those of conventional nuclear power. Host: So, does this mean that it needs to be built underground with a vertical nuclear fuel column made from this depleted uranium and the reaction progresses from top to bottom? Gates: That's right. With the current nuclear reactors, you have to keep refueling, so there are a lot of human factors and control issues that could go wrong. You need to open the reactor and move the nuclear fuel in and out, which can be risky and unreliable. So, if you have a very cheap fuel that is the size of a wooden pole, it can be used for 60 years. Just put it down and there are no complicated consequences. Let it burn for 60 years and then it's gone. Host: So, such a nuclear power plant itself is a waste disposal station for its own waste? Gates: That's right. The waste produced by this process can be left there, and this method only produces very little waste. You can also burn it in another nuclear power plant. We can start with the waste produced by existing nuclear power plants. Those waste in dry cans next to cooling ponds or reactors are our starting fuel. In this way, the problems of the current reactors themselves become our raw materials, and waste is greatly reduced. Host: When you talked about these possibilities with people from other places, who was most interested in implementing this? Gates: We haven't selected a specific location yet because there are secrecy rules regarding nuclear issues everywhere. Many companies from Russia, India, and China have expressed strong interest. I have also talked to the Energy Minister here about how to integrate this into the energy agenda. Overall, I am optimistic, and France and Japan have already made some progress. This is a variation of an existing achievement. This is an important step forward, but like a fast-reactor, many countries have built such reactors. As long as you have a fast-reactor, you could be the builder of the first nuclear waste recycling station. Host: In your opinion, what is the timeline and feasibility of implementing this plan? Gates: To build such a large-scale power plant, the cost must be very low. We have 20 years to invent and another 20 years to execute, roughly the final deadline calculated by our environmental model. If everything goes smoothly with Terrapower, which of course is not easy, this requirement can be easily met. Currently, there are dozens of companies engaged in this industry, and we need hundreds of them. If their scientific progress and funding for their experimental power plants are smooth, they can all compete for this task. It would be best if there were multiple successes because multiple methods could be used simultaneously. Host: If we talk about possible large-scale innovations, is this the biggest one you know? Gates: Energy breakthroughs are the most important thing, even without environmental constraints, it would still be the most important issue. Environmental constraints make it more prominent and urgent. In the nuclear field, there are other innovators, but I am not as clear about their work as I am about this project. Some people are innovating in the module aspect, which is another way. There is also a liquid reactor, which is a bit difficult to implement, but maybe they also think our way is difficult. So, there are many different ways. But the wonderful thing about nuclear power is that the energy contained in one uranium molecule is one million times that of other energy sources. If negative factors, mainly radiation, can be handled properly, its carbon emissions, cost, and potential will be unparalleled. Host: What if we fail? What emergency measures do we need to take to ensure stable earth temperatures? Gates: If things get to that point, it's like eating too much and you might get heart disease. What do you do? You may need heart surgery or something like that. There's a type of research called geoengineering that uses various technologies to slow down global warming. It can buy us 20-30 years of time to take collective action. However, that's like an insurance policy that you hope you never have to use. Some people say we shouldn't even study insurance measures because it can make people complacent. You'll continue to eat because you know heart surgery can save you. Given the importance of the problem, I don't know if that's wise. The discussion about geoengineering should now be a backup option in case the situation deteriorates faster or technological innovation lags behind our expectations. Host: What would you say to climate change skeptics if you had to convince them? Gates: Unfortunately, skeptics come from different camps. Very few of them hold scientific evidence. They say that the negative feedback results are due to cloud relationships. They rarely can provide convincing evidence, even if it's a probability of one in a million. The main problem here is like AIDS, where making mistakes now will lead to double the pain in the future. Therefore, when facing various urgent problems, enduring pain now is related to future gains, and it is an uncertain pain. In fact, the IPCC report is not the worst-case scenario, and some people in developed countries have said that it's not a big deal after reading the report. In reality, the uncertain aspect should encourage us to strive in this direction. However, my wish is that if you can make energy production economical while also meeting carbon dioxide emission restrictions, then skeptics will say: "OK, although I don't care about carbon dioxide emissions, I even hope it will emit more, but I will adopt this new method because energy is cheaper than before." Host: Can we say that this is your response to Bjorn Lomborg? In other words, if you spend all your energy on solving the carbon dioxide problem, it will replace other goals, such as solving world poverty or malaria, and investing money in those areas is a waste of capital. We have more important things to do. Gates: There isn't actually a lot of actual research and development investment. Although the US should invest an additional $10 billion in this area each year, it should not affect other things. For me, for ventures that require huge investments, if they are not economical and have no return, it's basically a waste. Some people may hold a different opinion on this. Unless you are already very close to success and on the investment learning curve, and it will become very cheap, otherwise, I think we should try multiple solutions with low-cost potential. If solving the climate problem ends up making energy abnormally expensive, to the point where only the rich can afford it, it will be a disaster for the two billion poor people on the earth. Furthermore, Lomborg's views have changed, and his argument now is why research has not received more attention. Based on historical reasons, he still belongs to the skeptical camp, but he has realized that it is a rather lonely camp. So he began to express his views on research and development, which I think is a very worthwhile topic to explore, because the lack of investment in scientific research is really unreasonable. Host: Bill, I think most of the people here, like me, sincerely hope your dream comes true. Thank you very much! Gates: Thank you, everyone.
I want to share with you a big discovery I made a few months ago. I was writing an article for an Italian magazine called "Wired," and I always kept a thesaurus by my side while writing. It wasn't until after I had finished the article that I realized I had never before looked up the specific meaning of "disabled" in the dictionary. Let me read the entry to you: "Disabled: adjective; meaning: crippled, helpless, useless, shattered, stagnant, destroyed, injured, damaged, lame, dismembered, broken, exhausted, weak, powerless, paralyzed, physically impaired, decrepit, dilapidated, idle, worn-out, fatigued, tattered, disregarded." Also listed: "injured, useless, weak." Antonyms: "healthy, strong, capable." When I read this out loud to a friend of mine, I laughed at first. It seemed ridiculous. But when I got to "damaged," I choked up. I had to stop and let myself recover from the emotional blow and the insult of these words. Yes, my thesaurus is old and worn-out. I assume it must be an old version as well. But in fact, its publication date is from the 1980s. I would have been in elementary school at that time, forming my sense of self outside of my family and establishing connections to the children around me and the world at large. Thank goodness I didn't use a thesaurus back then. What I mean is that the definition of "disabled" in this thesaurus shows that the world I live in doesn't accept disabled people like me. This world believes that there are no positive attributes to being disabled. However, today I am grateful for all the adventures and opportunities my life has brought me. So I immediately went online to look up the definition of "disabled" in the thesaurus from the 2009 version, hoping to see some important revisions. Below is the new version of the definition for "disabled" that I read aloud to you all. Unfortunately, the explanation for the entry was not much stronger than it was years ago. Two words in the "approaching antonyms" section of this entry made me feel particularly uncomfortable. They are "complete" and "sound." In fact, this is not just a matter of a few words. When people use negative words to describe disabled people, they actually reflect people's views of disabled people. It is worth noting the values that the language used to describe disabled people reflects, as well as the process by which these values are formed. Our language influences our thinking and the way we view the world and others. In fact, many ancient societies, including ancient Greece and Rome, believed in the enormous power of verbal curses, because once words are spoken, they exist as truth. So, what kind of existence do we want for ourselves? Do we want to be a person without ability or a person with ability? Sometimes, we casually name an adult or child, but it may limit their development, cast a shadow over them, and make them question their own abilities. Don't we want to open the door to their hearts? There was such a person in my life who opened the door to my heart. He was a doctor who took care of me when I was young. He worked at the A.I. Dupont Research Institute in Wilmington, Delaware. His name is Pizzutillo, an Italian-American. Obviously, his name is difficult for many Americans to pronounce. Let's call him Dr. P instead. Dr. P always wore colorful bow ties. His demeanor and temperament made him get along well with children. Except for physical training courses, the time I spent in his hospital was very happy. I had to use those rough, colorful, and elastic straps to do physical training over and over again to exercise my leg muscles. I hated those straps so much that I even gave them names. At that time, I was a five-year-old child and I bargained with Dr. P, asking him not to make me do those physical training courses again. Of course, I didn't get my way. However, one day, Dr. P came to see me while I was doing physical training. Hmm, those merciless, exhausting physical training courses. Then he said to me, "Amy, you are such a strong little girl. I feel that one day you will break these straps. When you break them, I will reward you with $100." Obviously, this was just a little trick from Dr. P. He just wanted me to do these physical training courses that I didn't love. He tempted me with "becoming the richest five-year-old patient on the second floor one day." But Dr. P did succeed in doing one thing, which was to transform a schedule that I hated into a brand new and promising experience. Today, I often think about the impact of Dr. P's vision and his nickname for me, "strong little girl," on my self-awareness. Nowadays, I can recognize that my inner strength is powerful and my future is bright. Dr. P's example illustrates how a strong adult can ignite a child's potential. However, in the example of the thesaurus mentioned earlier, our language did not enable us to turn what we hoped to see into reality. It did not make disabled people aware of their abilities. Technological development drives social development, but our language has not kept up with the times. Of course, from a medical perspective, my prosthetic leg, laser eye surgery to restore my vision, artificial titanium knee replacement surgery for the elderly, and other technologies enable people to fully utilize their abilities and overcome various limitations imposed by the natural environment. They also provide us, the disabled, with social platforms, allowing us to self-identify and choose our companions globally. Therefore, technology is showing us a timeless truth: that each and every one of us is very powerful and capable of contributing to society. Adaptability is human beings' greatest asset. Speaking of human adaptability, I find it very interesting because people often want me to talk about "overcoming adversity." Today, I want to make a statement that "overcoming adversity" does not apply to me at all. When someone asks me to speak on this topic, I feel very uncomfortable. I started to think about why this is. The term "overcoming adversity" has an implicit meaning, which is that success or happiness is on the other side of a difficult experience. However, this experience itself has nothing to do with success or happiness. It's like saying that the reason why I was able to succeed in my life is that I bypassed a series of challenges that amputees face and overcame factors that others see as limitations. But in reality, these challenges have changed us and left a mark on our life journey. These changes may be physical, mental, or both. What I want to say is that facing challenges is not a bad thing. Faced with adversity, we should not treat it as an obstacle to be avoided, but rather as a part of our lives. In fact, adversity is a part of our lives. I imagine adversity as my own shadow, sometimes it looks big, sometimes small, but it is always with me. Of course, I am not trying to diminish the value and significance of people fighting against adversity. We are destined to experience adversity and challenges in our lives, each and every one of us. But what we should focus on is not whether we should face adversity, but rather how to face it. So, our responsibility is not simply to let the people we care about live in a warm nest, but rather to help them develop the ability to deal with adversity calmly. When we make children feel that they do not have the ability to adapt to their environment, we actually hurt them. From a medical perspective, objectively judging whether I am disabled, and from a social perspective, subjectively considering whether I am a "disabled person," there is a big difference between the two. In fact, the only issue I have to face from beginning to end is the world's unfair view and description of me. We hope to protect the people we care about. We tell them the cold and clinical medical diagnosis reports, or sometimes predict their future living conditions for them. But we must pay attention to what we do and whether it will destroy these people. Perhaps people are used to focusing only on their own flaws and thinking about how to fix them. This way of thinking is more harmful to disabled people than their own physical defects. We do not look at disabled people from a holistic perspective and do not recognize their abilities. This undoubtedly adds insult to injury to their already difficult situation. We can effectively evaluate a person's value to the society they are in. Therefore, our focus should not be limited to the physical defects of disabled people, but to their value as human beings. Additionally, the most important point is that there is a connection between some of the disabilities of disabled people and human creativity. Therefore, the hard struggle years should not be belittled or denied. This is not something we should avoid or cover up. On the contrary, we should look for opportunities in adversity. The point I want to make is that adversity is not meant to be "overcome." We should face it openly, embrace it, wrestle with it, and even dance with it. Perhaps, if we can see adversity as something natural, continuous, and useful to human beings, its existence is no longer a burden to us. This year, we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth. When Darwin wrote "On the Origin of Species" 150 years ago, he elucidated a truth about human characteristics. The statement he made probably means that the species that survive are often not the strongest or the smartest, but the ones that are most adaptable to changes in the external environment. Contradictions and conflicts are the mother of creation. The works of Darwin and other masters reveal this point. The ability of human survival and reproduction comes from the transformation after the intense struggle of the human soul. That's right. Let me reiterate that the greatest ability of humanity is transformation and adaptation. Perhaps, before we are tested, we do not know what we will become. This may be the role that adversity can play, a recognition of oneself and one's own abilities. So, we can give ourselves a gift. We can see adversity as an opportunity for change, not as difficult times. Adversity is a kind of change, and we just haven't had time to adapt to it. I believe the biggest predicament we create for ourselves is the concept of "orthodoxy." Well, what exactly is "orthodoxy"? There is no such thing as "orthodoxy." I know what is "ordinary" and what is "typical," but I don't know what is "orthodox." If there were really such poor, emaciated so-called "orthodox people," would you be interested in them? I don't think so. If we don't invest our energy in pursuing "orthodoxy," but instead invest in discovering various possibilities, exploring various abilities, and taking risks, many children's potential will be better stimulated. They will fully utilize their unique and valuable abilities and contribute to their communities. Anthropologists tell us that as humans, we always hope that people in our group are useful and capable of contributing. The Neanderthal society of 60,000 years ago is good evidence of this. Neanderthals cared for the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled in their society because they firmly believed that the rich life experience of the elderly was valuable to their entire society. The elderly were never regarded as useless. On the contrary, they were considered very precious. A few years ago, I was at a vegetable market in my hometown, which is in the red zone of northeastern Pennsylvania. I was standing next to a basket of tomatoes at the time. Because it was summer, I was wearing shorts, and I heard a man's voice behind me say, "Hey, isn't that Amy Mullins?" I turned around and saw an old man I didn't know. Then I said, "I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember you." He said, "Hmm, you wouldn't remember our last encounter because at that time, I was delivering you from your mother's womb." Hehe, that's the kind of person I met. Of course, I eventually remembered. This person was Dr. Keane. I only knew about him through a story my mother told me. I was a late baby, born two weeks late. The doctor who was responsible for taking care of my mother during her delivery was on vacation at the time, so in the end, Dr. Keane, whom my parents had never met before, delivered me. When I was born, I didn't have a fibula, and my feet and toes were twisted. Dr. Kim had to deliver two pieces of bad news. He told my parents, "I told you in the diagnosis report that your child would never walk, run, or live independently like other children. But since then, you have turned me into a big liar through your efforts" (applause). Dr. Kim did a great thing. He began collecting all the newspaper articles about me since my childhood. This included when I won a spelling bee in second grade, when I marched in a Halloween parade with the Girl Scouts, when I received a scholarship in college, and all my athletic achievements. Dr. Kim used my story to teach local students. He used my story to teach students at Hanemann Medical College and Hershey Medical College. He called my story the X factor in his curriculum, the infinite potential inspired by human willpower. No medical diagnosis can explain how powerful willpower can be. Willpower can influence a person's quality of life. Dr. Kim continued to say to me, "Although many people have challenged my views, based on my experience, children can achieve great things even if they have little support." See, Dr. Kim's ideas have changed. He realized that there is a difference between medical diagnoses and how people handle those results. Over the years, my thoughts have also changed. For example, if you had asked me when I was 15 years old if I would trade my current prosthetic legs for real legs, I would have said yes without hesitation because I yearned for that "normalcy." But now, if you asked me that same question today, I would have to think twice. That's because the experience of using prosthetic legs has had such a profound effect on my life. Perhaps I have become a new person inside and out. Because among the people I have encountered, there have been far more who have opened doors for me than who have closed them. You see, what you really need is someone who can show you your own power. The human spirit is capable of great things. If you can give someone the key to unlock that power within themselves, and if at a critical moment you can use that key to open a door for them, then you have truly educated them in the best way possible. You have taught them to open their own doors to the new world. In fact, the word "educate" comes from the Latin word "e-ducare" which means "to draw out." So, what kind of potential do we want to draw out? Here's an example from 1960s England. In the UK it's called "common entrance exam", in the US we call it "tracking exam". The exam divides students into four groups, A, B, C, and D, based on their grades. A students take more challenging courses with better teachers, and so on. In this experiment, which lasted for three months, students who should have been classified as D students based on their grades were told that they were A students. They were told that they were very smart. At the end of the three-month experiment, this group of students performed at the level of A students. Of course, this case study also has its chilling aspect. Those students who should have been classified as A students were told that they were D students. Many of them dropped out of school by the end of the three-month experiment. One key point of this experiment is that the participating teachers were also unaware of the situation. The teachers didn't know that the students had been swapped. They were only told which students were A and which were D, and then the teachers adapted their teaching methods accordingly. So, I believe that true "disability" is a defeated soul, a soul with no hope for the future, a soul that cannot perceive beauty, a soul that has lost its childlike curiosity, and a soul that has lost the imagination inherent in humanity. If we can keep the human soul hopeful, enable it to see its own beauty and that of others, endow it with curiosity and imagination, then we are using our power well. As long as a soul possesses the qualities mentioned above, it can create infinite possibilities and new ways of life. I would like to end by sharing a poem with you. The author of the poem is the 14th-century Persian poet Hafez. This poem was told to me by my friend Jacques D'Amboise. The poem is called "A God Who Only Knows Four Words." "Every child has known God, Not the God of names, Not the God of don'ts, Not the God who ever does Anything weird. But a God who knows only four words And keeps repeating them, saying: 'Come dance with Me. Come dance.'" Thank you, everyone.
As you know, my job is to write children's books. In fact, I may be the most widely read children's author in the United States. I often tell people that I don't want to be seen as a scientist. You can think of me as a farmer, or someone wearing a leather jacket. But no one ever chooses to be a farmer. I'm here today to talk to you about cycles and epiphanies. Epiphanies usually mean that you find yourself in some situation where you have to hit a wall everywhere to find an epiphany. This is a picture of a cycle that my friend, Richard Bamberger, drew. It's very complicated. What I'm about to tell you about my cycle originates from the 60s, from Stuyvesant High School in Ohio, where I was a troublemaker. I'm the kind of person who was beaten until I bled in the boys' dormitory every week until a teacher rescued me from this life. She rescued me from this life and let me live in the teacher's lounge bathroom. She did it quietly and did it for three years. But I had to leave that town with my talents and $85. I eventually landed in San Francisco, California where I met my love. Looking back to the 1980s, I found that it was necessary to start working in AIDS organizations. About three or four years ago, I received a late-night call from Ms. Preston, my teacher. She said, "I need to see you. I'm disappointed. We've never really understood each other as adults. Can you come to Ohio? Please bring the person you found with you." I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer, but I'd like you to ignore that part. The next day, we arrived in Cleveland and met with her, talking and crying. We knew she needed to move into a hospice for terminally ill patients, so we found one for her and took her there. We took care of her and her family because it was necessary. Some things we need to know how to do. This is what made her treat me like an adult and want to know about the girl I was dating. In the end, it all turned to dust in my hands, and this marked the end of the cycle, which is what I call enlightenment. This enlightenment is that death is a part of life. She saved my life, and my friend and I saved hers. What was required during those days was something that only life could provide, something true and beautiful. I'm glad that these things are being mentioned multiple times today. It also needs - it needs dignity, love, and joy. Our job is to spread these things around. Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important to me. Through my artwork, I try to articulate that humans are not separate from nature but everything is interconnected. About 10 years ago, I went to Antarctica for the first time and saw icebergs for the first time. I was in awe. My heart was pounding and I was dizzy trying to comprehend what was in front of me. The iceberg beside me rose almost 200 feet above the water. I felt strange, it was just a snowflake covering another snowflake, formed year after year. Icebergs form when they break off from glaciers or ice shelves. Each iceberg has its own unique personality. Their interaction with their surroundings and situations has a distinctive way. Some icebergs refuse to compromise and persist until the end, while others cannot endure and collapse under intense passion at a certain moment. When you see icebergs, it is easy to think that they are isolated, independent, and solitary, much like our human perception of ourselves sometimes. But reality is far from that. As icebergs melt, I breathe in their ancient smell. As icebergs melt, they release mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes all things. I set out to photograph these icebergs, as if I were photographing portraits of my ancestors, to understand that at these particular moments, icebergs exist in this way, but will never exist like this again. When they melt, it is not death; it is not an end, but a continuation of the path to everlasting life. Some of the ice I have photographed is very young - only a few thousand years old. Some ice is over 100,000 years old. The last image I want to show you is an iceberg I photographed on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland. It was a rare opportunity for us to witness an iceberg rolling over. So this is as shown in the picture. On the left, you can see a small boat. It's a boat that's about 15 feet long. I want you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and how it changes on the surface of the water. Here you can see it starting to roll, the boat moving to the other side, and a man standing there. This is an average-sized Greenland iceberg. It's about 120 feet high or 40 meters high when it's above the water surface. This video was shot in real-time. Just like these icebergs, they show different aspects of their personality to everyone. Thank you.
I hope everyone can imagine this: Two couples, in the middle of 1979, on the same day, at the same time, each conceive a child. So, each couple has conceived a child. Now, I don't want you to spend too much time imagining pregnancy because if you spend too much time on it, you won't hear what I'm saying. So just think about it briefly. In this scenario, let's imagine that one example is a sperm carrying a Y chromosome meeting an egg carrying an X chromosome, and the other is a sperm carrying an X chromosome meeting an egg carrying an X chromosome. Both survive and begin to develop. Later, we'll look at these two couples again. I play two roles in my field of anatomy and historical research. I am a historian who studies how humans treat anatomy - whether it's human bodies or animal bodies - and how they deal with bodily fluids and the abstracted body. I study how they view the body. As a social activist, my other role is as an advocate for patients - or as I sometimes say, as a patient advocate for doctors. I'm very radical. In my work, I come into contact with people who challenge social norms. For example, some of the people I've come into contact with are conjoined twins - two people sharing one body. Others are dwarfs, much smaller than the average person. Additionally, many of the people I come into contact with have genders that are different from the norm - that is, they do not have the typical male or female physical characteristics. Overall, this condition can be called intersex. Intersex can take many forms. Let me give you some examples to illustrate types of people who have neither standard male nor standard female characteristics. For example, one person may have XY chromosomes and the SRY gene on the Y chromosome, which stimulates the primitive gonads we all have in the fetal period to become testicles. Therefore, during fetal development, the testes secrete testosterone. However, this individual lacks receptors to receive testosterone, so the body cannot react to testosterone. This is a condition called androgen insensitivity syndrome. So, although the amount of testosterone is high, it cannot trigger a reaction, so the body will develop towards feminization. When the baby is born, she looks like a girl, and is raised as a little girl. In most cases, it is not until her breasts begin to develop during puberty that she does not have a female cycle, and then we begin to suspect that something is wrong. They then discover that she has no ovaries or uterus. In fact, she has testes in her body and carries a Y chromosome. Now, an important point to note is that many people would assume that this person is actually a boy, but that is not the case. Women, just like men, have an organ called the adrenal gland in their body. It is located at the back of our body and is responsible for secreting androgens, a type of male hormone. Most women like me - I believe I am a typical woman - actually do not know the composition of our chromosomes. But I think I should have a typical female one - like most women like me who are actually androgen-sensitive. We secrete androgens and respond to them. As a result, some women like me are exposed to too much androgen in the brain, which is even more than the girl with androgen insensitivity syndrome who had testes at birth. Therefore, gender is a very complex thing. It is not that those intersex people are between male and female - in some ways, they can cover the entire range of sex characteristics. Here's another example. A few years ago, I received a call from a 19-year-old boy. He was born as a boy and was also raised as a boy. Later, he had a girlfriend and had sexual relations with her, living his life as a boy. But recently, he found out that he had ovaries and a uterus in his body. He has a very extreme condition called steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency. He carries XX chromosomes and when he was in the uterus, his adrenal glands were very active, forming a male hormone environment. The result is that he developed male reproductive organs. His brain received more typical male hormones. So he was born looking like a boy—no one suspected anything. It was only when he reached 19 and began experiencing physiological problems that doctors discovered he was actually female internally. Okay, let's quickly look at another example of a situation that could result in intersex traits. Some people with XX chromosomes may develop an organ called ovotestis, which is a type of organ where ovarian tissue is enveloped by testicular tissue. We still can't determine its cause. So gender can take many forms. Children with these physical traits—whether it's dwarfism, conjoined twins, or intersex—are often operated on by surgeons, not necessarily for physical health reasons, as their bodies are often healthy, but rather because they pose a threat to the way we categorize people in our society. In other words, there is already a typical understanding in society of what kind of body structure has what kind of characteristics. Therefore, our concept is that as a woman, one must have female traits, and so on. For example, a black person must have African body structure characteristics. This is why we have this overly simplistic understanding in our resumes. When we face a body that is different in some aspects, those unclassifiable thoughts surprise us. Therefore, our culture has many naive ideas about individualism, and our country is built on a very impractical concept of individualism. You can imagine how shocking it is when you have two children born in one body. I encountered this situation most recently last year when South African athlete Caster Semenya was questioned about her gender during the Berlin International. Many reporters called me and asked, "What testing methods will they use to prove to everyone whether Caster Semenya is male or female?" So I had to explain to them that there really is no testing method. In fact, we now understand that gender is very complex. We have to admit that there is no clear boundary in nature to distinguish between male or female, or male and intersex, or female and intersex. This boundary is actually drawn by ourselves. Therefore, the situation we are facing now is that the more science develops, the more we have to admit that the classification of these genders, which we think is so natural in terms of bodily structures, is too simplistic and that the actual situation is much more blurry than we can imagine. And this is not just about gender, but also about race. The complexity is far beyond what our academic language can describe. As we can see, we are dealing with various difficult fields. Let's take an example: the fact is that when we compare 95% of human DNA with that of chimpanzees, we find that human DNA is only slightly different in some nucleotides. The more technology advances, the more we will deal with areas that cause people distress. We must admit that the simple classifications that we have been using are too simplistic. Therefore, we are examining various areas of human life, including our cultural field, which is currently discussing the origin and end of life in the United States. We are having a difficult discussion about when we become human and have rights different from fetuses. Today, we have a very controversial issue - perhaps less so outside the medical community - about when to determine human death. In the past, our ancestors never dwelled too much on this issue when people died. At most, they just stuck a feather under the person's nose. If the feather moved, others would not bury them, and if it did not move, they would bury them. However, now we want to transplant organs from the deceased to other people, which leads us to get caught up in the difficult questions mentioned above. This puts us in a very difficult situation where previous simple classifications no longer apply. You may now think that all these collapsing classifications might make people like me, who constantly advocate for progressive political views and defend those whose bodies are different from others, happy. However, I must admit that this change makes me uneasy. The recognition that these classification systems are even more unstable than we imagine makes me nervous. At the same time, my nervousness comes from a democratic perspective. So, in order to convey to everyone the degree of this tension, I must first admit that I am a loyal fan of the Founding Fathers. I know they were racists and male supremacists, but they were great. What I mean is that they were so brave, fearless, and actively engaged in their cause. Every few years, I have to go back and appreciate the slightly old-fashioned musical "1776" (a musical about the history of the founding of the United States), not because the music is good, which can be completely ignored, but because of the events surrounding the Founding Fathers in 1776. I think the Founding Fathers were the earliest anatomists, and that's why I love them. They opposed one anatomical concept and replaced it with another. This new, beautiful concept has lasted 200 years. Remember, our Founding Fathers opposed a monarchical system based on an oversimplified anatomical concept. The old regime's emperors had no concept of DNA. But they adhered to the concept of "birth." They had the concept of nobility, and they believed that those in political power should wield it because the nobility should be passed down from grandfather to father to son, generation after generation. The founding fathers opposed this view and replaced it with a new anatomical concept - the concept of equality. They eliminated the hierarchical idea and determined that the importance of anatomy lies in the equality of all people, not in their social status. At that time, it was indeed a very radical reform. To some extent, this reform is still ongoing because they are part of the Enlightenment movement system. Two things are developing together. The democratic system was forming at that time, but technology was also advancing. It is very clear that if you pay attention to the history of the founding fathers, many of them were interested in science and were interested in the concept of naturalism. They rejected supernatural claims and rejected those claims about supernatural forces because the concept of supernatural forces was based on very vague ideas about lineage. They advocated the concept of naturalism. If you observe, you will find that, for example, in the Declaration of Independence, they referred to nature and the natural god. They did not mention God and God's nature. They referred to the power of nature to explain who we are. Therefore, as part of it, they brought us a concept that all men are created equal. In doing so, they paved a beautiful path for the future civil rights movement. They could not have imagined what the future would hold, but they laid the foundation for us, which is very great. So, what happened years later? For example, what happened with women? They longed for the right to vote. According to the concept of the Founding Fathers, the equality of all people was far more important than their social status. They said, "The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not sufficient to mean that we have no right to vote, no full citizenship rights, no right to private property, etc." Women's demands were successful, and then came the successful civil rights movement, which produced people like Sojourner Truth, who said, "Ain't I a Woman?" We know that men once had a saying in the development of the civil rights movement, "I am a man." Furthermore, people of color called for equality for all and an end to racial discrimination. We also see the same success in the rights movement for disabled people. The problem is, of course, when we start to examine all citizens, we have to start questioning why we maintain fixed boundaries. Now, it should be noted that I want to maintain some boundaries, specifically those relating to anatomical structure within our cultural context. For example, I don't want to give fish the same rights as humans. I don't want us to give up all the anatomical distinctions we've made. I don't want a five-year-old child to be allowed to engage in sexual activity or be allowed to get married. So, there are some anatomical boundaries that are meaningful to us, and I think those should be preserved. But the difficult task is trying to figure out which ones should be preserved and why they are meaningful. So, let's go back to the two people mentioned at the beginning of the speech, the two couples who both got pregnant on the same day in mid-1979. Let's imagine that Mary was born three months premature, and therefore she was born on June 1, 1980. Henry, on the other hand, was born full-term. He was born on March 1, 1980. It's just that Mary got the time to obtain various rights three months earlier than Henry did, such as the right to have sex, the right to vote, and the right to drink. Henry had to wait, and his physiological age was no different, just because he was born at a different time. We also find some other bizarre issues with rights. Henry, assumed to be male - although I haven't told you he has XY chromosomes - now has to register for the draft, but Mary doesn't have to worry about that. Meanwhile, Mary cannot enjoy the same rights as Henry in all states, specifically, the right to marry. Henry can get married in any state, but Mary can only marry a woman in a few states now. Therefore, some of the structural biological classifications we insist on are problematic and need to be questioned in many ways. For me, the question becomes: what do we do when our science is so advanced in anatomy? We've come to a point where we have to admit that democracy based on anatomical people may be collapsing. I don't want to lose hope for science, but at the same time, sometimes I vaguely feel that the development of science is influenced by us. So where do we go from here? It seems like our society has a utilitarian attitude: "Okay, I need to draw a boundary somewhere, so I'll draw it there." But many people are caught in an awkward position because of this. For example, in Texas, a decision to marry a man means you don't have a Y chromosome, while marrying a woman means you do. In reality, they don't actually test for chromosomes, but it's still very strange. Because I initially told you the story about androgen insensitivity syndrome, let's look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In his "I Have a Dream" speech, he provided a solution for us. He believed that we should "not be judged by the color of our skin but by the content of our character," rejecting racial differences. I want to say, "Yes, that sounds like a good idea," but how do you actually do that in practice? How do you judge someone based on their character? I also want to point out that I'm not sure how we should allocate human rights. Because, I have to admit, some golden retrievers seem to deserve more help from society than some people I know. I also know that some Labradors seem to be more cautious, smarter, and make more mature decisions about sexual matters than some 40-year-olds. So how do we measure the issue of character? It turns out to be very difficult. I also wonder if it would be possible to scan for good or bad character in the future. Perhaps we could see it with MRI scans? Do we really want to go that far? I'm not sure where we are headed, but I do know that it is important to think about the problems that exist in the democracy led by the United States. We have done very well in the fight for democracy, and I think we will continue to do better in the future. Our situation is different from Iran, for example, if a man is attracted to other men in a sexual way, he can be killed unless he is willing to change his sexual orientation. Then he can live. We don't have that situation. I am happy to say that we don't have that situation. I said to a surgeon a few years ago when he brought in conjoined twins hoping to help separate them and also make a name for himself. But when I talked to him on the phone and asked him why he wanted to do this surgery, which was very risky, he replied that in this country, such children would be cruelly treated, so he had to help them. My response to him was, "Have you considered political asylum for them rather than surgery?" The United States provides great possibilities for children like this to maintain their own characteristics without changing their bodies for the country. Therefore, I think we should lead this way of thinking. Well, speaking of this, I would like to remind everyone that I have talked about a lot of things from the past. I also want to consider what democracy might be or what it might already be. If we can get more mothers involved, I would like to say something a bit radical to feminists, which is that I think different people may bring different perspectives. Especially when we are used to group thinking. I have been interested in intersex people for many years and have also conducted research on gender differences for many years. One of the things that interests me very much is to observe the differences between men and women around the world in thinking about and solving problems. From cross-cultural studies, we know that, on average, women are more inclined to pay attention to complex social relationships and care for and sympathize with vulnerable groups in the population. If we think about it this way, we find an interesting situation. Several years ago, when I was in graduate school, a professor who knew I was interested in the feminist movement - I consider myself a feminist and always have - asked me a strange question. He said, "Tell me where the femininity is in feminist women." I thought, "Well...that's the most speechless question I've ever heard. Feminism is the umbrella term for all activities that eliminate outdated gender concepts, so there is no femininity in feminism." However, further interpretation of this question, what I thought more about is that perhaps feminism does have some femininity. That is to say, perhaps some aspects of female thinking, which are different from male thinking, make us more vigilant about complex social relationships and pay more attention to vulnerable groups. But previous scholars carefully pointed out how to protect individuals from the influence of the state. If we inject more maternal qualities into this concept, we may have much more than a concept. It's not just about protection, but about taking care of each other. Perhaps this is the path we will take in the future. When we speak of democracy without distinction of race - that is, giving less consideration to individual characteristics and more consideration to the relationships between people. Therefore, when people try to create a better community, what we need to consider is what we have done for others. Thank you.
In 2007, I felt that we needed to redefine the concept of economic development in our consciousness. Our new goal should be to have at least five competitive cities that can attract new residents when every family considers where they want to live and work. We still have a long way to go to achieve this goal. In developing countries, billions of people are at a stage where no city is willing to accept them. But the amazing thing about cities is that their value in use is much greater than their construction cost. So we can easily build dozens or even hundreds of new cities for the world. You may think this sounds ridiculous if you've never thought about new cities. But this is just a substitute for residential buildings in cities. Imagine that half of the people who want to live in apartments have already moved in, and the other half have not. You can add to the existing residential buildings to try to expand the area. But it's very difficult to do these additions because the residential buildings and surrounding land you handle are protected by law to ensure their comfort and entertainment. Starting over is better than being stagnant. Therefore, I propose that the government designate new areas that are large enough to accommodate cities and name them "Charter Cities." Around the time I learned about this, Javier and Octavio were thinking about the issue of re-planning in Honduras. It is said that about 75,000 Hondurans immigrate to the United States every year, and they want to know what they can do to ensure that these people stay and work in Honduras. Once, Javier said to Octavio, "What if we give our idle land to the embassy? Some to the US Embassy, some to the Canadian Embassy. Then if they want to work in the native area under Canadian or US rules, they can find work in these embassies' local areas. Otherwise, they have to go to Canada or the US to find work." In the summer of 2009, Honduras experienced a bloody military coup. In the next regular election, Pepe Lobo won overwhelmingly with promises of reform and peace talks during his campaign speech. He invited Octavio to be his chief of staff. At the same time, I was preparing for a TEDGlobal speech. Through a series of improvements, trial and error, and extensive user testing, I tried to compress the complex concept of the Charter City into its essence. The first point is the importance of laws, just like the law that says you cannot harass tenants who have already moved in. We focus on new technologies, but new technologies require technical and regulatory requirements to be implemented. Usually, these requirements hold us back. In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to this TEDTalk. He showed it to Javier, and they called me and said, "Let's show this to our president." In December, we met in a hotel conference room in Miami. I tried to explain the value of these cities and how much value they can generate compared to their costs. I used this slide to show the value of an undeveloped piece of land in areas like New York. Note that at certain points, the land price can reach several thousand US dollars per square meter. But this is a rough and abstract discussion. At some point, Octavio said, "Paul, maybe we can watch a TEDTalk." TEDTalk explained in a simple way that Charter Cities are a chance to live under regulations that people can choose whether or not to comply with, starting from an uninhabited area, with the Charter detailing the regulations to be implemented. The Honduran President asked me a question, saying that people who support this project are essential, which is the key, and it will lead our country forward. I was invited to visit Trujillo and restate this project on January 4th and 5th. I presented another case study that included this slide, trying to explain that if you want to create significant value in the city, it must also be enormous. This is a photo of Denver, highlighting the new airport built in Denver. This airport alone covers an area of ​​over 100 square kilometers. I tried to convince the Honduran President that if you want to build a new city, you need to start with an area of ​​at least 1,000 square kilometers. This is bigger than 25 million acres. Everyone politely applauded. The audience's expression was serious and alert. The chairman of the meeting walked to the front and said, "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture, but maybe we can watch the TEDTalk. I have it on my laptop now." So I sat down, and they watched the TEDTalk. It also captures the essence that new cities bring people new choices. This is a choice to go to the city, perhaps in Honduras, not hundreds of kilometers to the north. It also gives leaders new choices. Because the leadership of the Honduran government needs the help of friendly countries, those who benefit from friendly countries, those who help them establish and implement the regulations in the charter, make everyone believe that the charter will actually be implemented. President Lobo's understanding is a guarantee of implementation ability. I think that as a method of attracting foreign investment to build a city, it is as important as the different parties' fear and suspicion that Honduras has experienced for many years. We conducted a field survey of the area. This is a photo of that area. It can easily accommodate 1,000 square kilometers. Shortly thereafter, on January 19, they voted in Congress to amend the constitution to provide legal support to permit specific development areas. In this country that had just experienced a coup, the vote in favor of the constitutional amendment in Congress was 124 to 1. All factions, all parties in society supported this amendment. As part of the constitution, you actually need to pass it twice in Congress. On February 17, they passed the bill again with 114 to 1. Immediately after the vote, from February 21 to 24, a delegation of about 30 Honduran representatives came to the two most interested construction sites in the world. One is South Korea. This is a picture of a large new city center that South Korea will build - even larger than the Boston commercial district. Everything you see was just built four years ago, but it took four years to get permission to build. Another attraction for the construction industry is Singapore. They have actually built two new cities in China and are preparing to build a third one. If you think about this rationally, this is our current situation. They have the land and are already considering building it into a second city. They are entering a statutory process that allows managers to intervene while having an additional legal system. One country has voluntarily allowed the Supreme Court to become the final court of appeal for this new judicial system. This is of interest to urban designers and architects. This may even bring them some economic support. But there is one thing you know that has long been resolved, which is that there are many tenants. Many merchants are interested in entering the United States, especially in free trade zones, and many people want to go there. In the world, 700 million people want to immigrate permanently to some other place immediately. One million people go from Latin America to the United States every year. Many of them are fathers who are away from their families and come to work - sometimes single mothers - to earn a living. Sadly, sometimes it is even children trying to reunite with their parents whom they have not seen for decades. What kind of vision is it to consider building a new city in Honduras? Or building a dozen new cities or hundreds of new cities around the world? What kind of vision is it to insist that every family has a choice of several cities that are competitive and attractive to new residents? This is a view worth spreading." My friends in Honduras asked me to say thank you, TED.
My name is Jessie, and this is my suitcase. But before I show you what's inside, I have a very public confession to make: I am obsessed with clothes. I love finding them, wearing them, and lately, even photographing them and writing about them in my crazy, colorful, unique outfits, each with their perfect occasion. But I don't buy anything new. My clothes all come from secondhand sources, flea markets, and thrift stores. Oh, thank you. Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce my impact on the environment and on my wallet. I get to meet interesting people, save money to donate to charities, express my personal style, and turn shopping into my own personal treasure hunt. I wonder, what will I find today? Will it be in my size? Will it be in a color I like? Will it be under 20 dollars? If the answer is "yes" to all of these, then I feel like I've won. I want to go back to my suitcase and tell you what I brought for this exciting week at TED. What would this guy with so many clothes bring? So, I'm going to show you what I brought. I brought seven pairs of underwear, just these. Exactly one week's worth of underwear is everything inside my suitcase. I bet I'll find everything I need in Palm Springs. And since you're not looking at the "woman walking around TED in her underwear," it means that I did find some new things. And now I really want to show you what I wore for the week. Doesn't that sound great? Of course, I will also talk to you about life advice and such, whether you believe it or not, these are ideas I have refined through my adventures in "upcycling". So let's start with Sunday. I call this one the "Sparkly Tiger". You don't need to spend a lot of money to look extraordinary. You can almost always impress people with less than $50. This whole outfit, including the jacket, cost me $55, and it was the most expensive outfit I wore all week. Monday: Colors are powerful. It's almost impossible physiologically to be in a bad mood when wearing bright red pants. Tuesday: Mainstream is vastly overrated. I spent a lot of my life trying to be myself while fitting into the mainstream. Just be yourself. If you have the right people around you, they'll not only understand, they'll appreciate it. Wednesday: Embrace your inner child. Sometimes people tell me I look like I'm playing dress-up, or I remind them of their seven-year-old. I love to smile at them and say, "Thank you." Thursday: Confidence is key. If you think you look good, you definitely will. If you don't think you look good, you're probably right. My mother told me this every day growing up, but I didn't understand it until I was 30. And I'll break it down for you real quick. If you believe you're a beautiful person, inside and out, there's no piece of clothing that you can't wear well. So nobody in this room has any excuse. We can wear what we want. Thank you. Friday: A universal truth - three words for you: Gold sequin everything. And finally, Saturday: Develop a unique personal style. It's really a great way to tell the world who you are without saying a word. It has proven to me time and time again that when people approach me throughout this week, it is simply because of what I am wearing. We have had pleasant conversations. Of course, these clothes won't fit into my small suitcase. So before I return to Brooklyn, I will donate everything back. Because this week I am teaching myself that letting go is possible. I don't need to cling to things, because in the next corner, there will always be another set of crazy, brightly colored, sparkling clothes waiting for me as long as I search for them with love. Thank you very much. Thank you.
This is a diagram of the brain. Your brain can be divided into two parts. The left brain is mainly responsible for rationality, while the right brain is mainly responsible for intuition. If we use a scale to measure the ability of each hemisphere of the brain and mark our brain, for example, this represents someone who is completely rational. This represents someone who is completely intuitive. So where would you place your brain on this line? Some people may choose one of these extreme situations, but I think for most of the audience, the position of your brain should be roughly like this--both hemispheres of the brain have high potential at the same time. They are unlikely to be mutually exclusive or anything like that. You can be both rational and intuitive. I consider myself to be someone who, like most other experimental physicists, has good logical thinking skills and can connect complex ideas. However, at the same time, we also need good intuition to make the experiment work. So, how do we improve this intuition? Well, we like to study things. We study and tinker with things ourselves, and then we observe how they react. Then we improve our intuition from it. In fact, you are also doing the same thing. There are some intuitions that you may have cultivated for many years, such as the notion that an object can only appear in one position at a time. I mean, it would be weird to ask you to consider an object that can appear in two different places at the same time, but you are not born with this concept, you develop it later in life. I remember seeing a kid playing on a seesaw. He was just a toddler and not good at it, and he kept falling. But I bet playing with the seesaw taught him a valuable lesson, that large objects won't easily let you pass through, and they stay in one place. This is a very conceptual model that exists in the world, unless you are a particle physicist. For particle physicists, this is also a bad model because they don't study bumpers, they study small and strange particles. When they study their particles, they feel like they are doing all sorts of really weird things - as if they can pass through walls, or they can appear in two places at the same time. When they recorded these findings, they named it the theory of quantum mechanics. This was the forefront of physics a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe small particles. But you don't need it to describe large, everyday objects. This does not match my intuition, perhaps because I don't often study particles. Well, I sometimes study them, just not often. And I have never seen them either. I mean, no one can see particles. But this does not match my logical understanding. Because if all things are made up of particles and each particle follows the theory of quantum mechanics, then shouldn't all things also follow the theory of quantum mechanics? I can't find a reason why it wouldn't. So, to better understand the whole thing, I started working on something. I made this. This is the first product of quantum mechanics superposition that you can see. What we see here is a computer microchip. The green dot in the middle is the metal I'm going to talk about next. This is a picture of it. Focusing on one point, we see the one at the center. This is a metal piece observed at a very close distance. What we see is a small piece of metal that looks like a diving board and extends at one end. I made this metal piece using almost the same method as making a computer chip. I worked in a sterile room with a silicon wafer, and then I operated about 100 hours among all these large machines. To get the final result, I had to make my own machine to make the swimming pool-shaped hole below the equipment. This device has the ability to perform quantum superposition, but it needs some help to complete this step. Let me give you an example. You know how uncomfortable it is in a crowded elevator, right? I mean, when I'm alone in the elevator, I can do all sorts of weird things, but when other people come in, I stop doing these things because I don't want to disturb or, frankly, scare them. So quantum mechanics shows that non-living things also behave in the same way. The non-living passengers not only include people, but also the light that shines on it, the wind that blows over it, and the heat in the space. So if we want to witness this piece of metal exhibiting the properties of quantum mechanics, we have to eliminate all other passengers. That's what we did. We turned off the lights, then we put it in a vacuum pump and pumped out all the air, and then we cooled it down just a little above absolute zero. Now, in the elevator, the small metal plate can do whatever it wants. We measured its motion. We found that it moves in a very strange way. It vibrates instead of being completely still. Its vibration is like this - like a bellows that opens and closes. With a slight impact, we can make it vibrate while not vibrating - something that only happens in the realm of quantum mechanics. I'm going to tell you some wonderful things here. What does it mean for something to vibrate and not vibrate at the same time? Let's consider atoms. For example, all of the trillions of atoms that make up the metal sheet are motionless and moving up and down at the same time. Only at a specific and precise moment are they in unison. For the rest of the time, they are indeterminate. This means that each atom is in two different places at the same time, further indicating that the entire metal sheet is in two positions. I think this is really cool. Really. What I have done in the sterile room over the years has been worthwhile because, as you can see, the ratio of a single atom to the metal sheet is about the same as the ratio of the entire metal sheet to you as an individual. So if a single atom can exist in two different locations at the same time, then why can't a metal plate be in two different locations as well? That's just my logical thinking. Now, imagine if you could exist in multiple locations at once. How would your cognition handle the problem of being non-localized in space? This is just a part of the story. When we heated the metal plate and turned on the light to observe inside the box, we saw that the metal plate was still just one piece. So I had to form a new intuition that all objects in the elevator are actually quantum objects squeezed into a tiny space. You've heard a lot about how quantum physics explains how everything is connected. Well, it's not entirely correct; it's broader and more profound than that. It is these connections, the connections between you and everything around you, that truly define who you are. This is the profundity and the incredible nature of quantum mechanics. Thank you.
My name is Amit, and 18 months ago, I had another job at Google. I came up with an idea to do something in the realm of art and museums and brought it up to my boss. She's here today and agreed to it. Over the course of 18 months, I've gone through many interesting negotiations and stories, and have visited 17 very interesting museums across 9 different countries. But before I go into that, I want to focus on this presentation. I could tell many stories to explain why we are doing this, but my personal story is simply written on the slides: how I got into (visiting) these works of art. I grew up in India, and I had a good education, so I don't want to complain. But I didn't have many opportunities to visit museums and see art, so when I had the chance to travel and visit these museums, I started to learn a lot. When I started working at Google, I had the idea of integrating technology to make it easier for everyone to visit. So we formed a team, a great little group, and we began to work on this project. First, I will show you the demo, and then I will tell you a few interesting stories since the project started. So, it's very simple. You go to GoogleArtProject.com, and you can see all these museums. You can see the Uffizi Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Hermitage Museum, the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, and now let me show you my favorite one, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. There are two ways to enter, and they are very simple. You click, and you're in the museum, no matter where you are, whether it's Mumbai or Mexico. You wander around and enjoy yourself. If you want to walk around the museum according to the floor plan, open the floor plan, click, and you're in. If you want to walk to the end of the corridor, continue walking and have fun exploring. Thank you. I haven't talked about the best part yet. Now I'm facing my favorite painting, "The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. I see this plus sign. If the museum gives us the image, you click it. This is one of the images. Here are all the metadata information. If you are really interested in this artwork, you can click here, but for now, I will close it. This is an image we took using our so-called gigapixel technology. For example, this image is close to 10 billion pixels. Many people ask me, "What do you get from 10 billion pixels?" I will now show you what 10 billion pixels can provide you with. You can easily zoom in and see some interesting things. I love this guy, and his expression is priceless. But you really want to go deeper, so I look around and see something here. I said, "Wait a minute, this is interesting." I get closer, and I start to notice that these kids are throwing something. I did some research and talked to a few people at the museum and found out that this is a game called [unknown], where you hit a goose with a stick. It was still very popular on the Tuesday of Confession. I don't know why they do this, but I learned something new. Now let's go deeper and you can see the cracks. Now let me show you the big picture. I'm going to shrink the image, and you can really see the whole thing. This is our location, and this is the painting. The best is yet to come. Wait a minute. Now let's immediately enter the Museum of Modern Art in New York. My other favorite: "Starry Night." All the examples I gave you earlier were about details. But what if you want to see the brushwork? If you want to see how Van Gogh created this masterpiece, you zoom in, really zoom in. I zoom in on my favorite part. I've never looked at it like this before. This is "Starry Night." I want to introduce you to another feature I like. There's so much here, and I don't have time to introduce it all. This is a really cool feature called Collections. Anyone, anyone, rich or poor, whether you have a fancy house or not, can enter and create your own network museum and build your own collection from these works. It's easy. You enter, and I've created this thing called the Power of Zoom. You can zoom in and explore. These are "The Envoys" from the National Art Gallery. You can write annotations and send them to your friends, really opening up discussions and exploring your appreciation for these masterpieces. So I think, in summary, the most important thing for me is that these exquisite artworks didn't come from Google. I personally don't think they even came from the museum. Maybe I shouldn't say that. They really come from these artists. This is my humble feeling in this process. I mean, I hope this digital media can give them the credit they deserve for their artwork and correctly display their works. And now the biggest question I get is, "Are you trying to replicate the museum experience?" My answer is no. This is a complementary experience. That's all I have to say. Thank you.
Good afternoon everyone. I have something to show you. Think of this as a pixel, a flying pixel. We call it sensing design in the laboratory. Let me introduce this to you. Now, if you hold this photo - I am Italian, and every Italian boy has this photo on their bedroom wall as they grow up. But the reason I am showing you this is because some interesting things have happened in the F1 Formula in the past few decades. Before, if you wanted to win the F1 race, you just needed a budget, and then you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car. If your car and driver were good enough, then you would win. Nowadays, if you want to win, you actually need something else like this - some equipment that can detect the race car in real-time. It is connected to thousands of sensors that collect relevant data from the car, transmit it into the system, and process it. And use this to feedback decisions to the car itself to make real-time changes synchronized with information collection. This is called a real-time monitoring system, in the engineers' words. Basically, this system consists of two components, one is the sensor and the other is the driver. Interestingly, this real-time monitoring system is now starting to infiltrate into our lives. Our cities have been covered by networks and the electronics industry in the past few years. They have become like wireless receiving and transmitting computers. At the same time, as wireless computers, they have begun to respond differently and can sense and brake. If we can optimize our cities, it will be a leap forward. As an aside, I would like to say that cities occupy only 2% of the earth's surface, but they account for 50% of the world's population. Their energy consumption accounts for 75% of the world's consumption and produces 80% of carbon dioxide emissions. So if we can optimize cities, it will be a leap forward. All these sensors and brakes are entering into our daily lives above these cities. This is an exhibition organized by Paola Antonelli at the Museum of Modern Art in New York this summer. The theme is "Talk to Me." Our objects, our environment, are beginning to give us feedback. In a sense, like every atom is becoming a sensor and an actuator. At the same time, this fundamentally changes our relationship as humans with nature. In a sense, this is Michelangelo's ancient dream... You know, when Michelangelo carved the statue of Moses, at the end he picked up a hammer and threw it at the statue of Moses - in fact, you can still see the small groove below - shouting, "Why don't you speak, why?" Today, for the first time, our environment is starting to give us feedback. I will show several cases - one time where we sensed and responded to our environment with our consciousness. Let's start with the sensing stage. The first project I want to share with you is actually one of the first projects we did in our laboratory. It was in Italy 4 years and 6 months ago. What we did there was to use a new type of network, which is now covering the world - the mobile network - and collect anonymous aggregated information from any terminal to understand how the city works. That summer was a lucky summer - 2006. It was the year Italy won the World Cup. Some of you may remember the game between Italy and France, and Zidane's header before the end of the match. Anyway, Italy won in the end. Now let's see what happened that day using the grid to show it in real-time. You see the city now. You see the Colosseum in the center, the Tiber River. This is in the morning, before the match. You're looking at the timeline at the top. At noon, people here and there are making phone calls and walking around. The match begins - silence. France scores a goal. Italy scores a goal. Halftime, everyone quickly makes a phone call, goes to the bathroom. Second half, the end of the match. First extra time, second extra time. That's when Zidane made the header. Italy won. Haha. That night, everyone went to the city center to celebrate. You can see the peak. The next day, everyone went to the city center to welcome the triumphant team and the prime minister. Then the crowd began to thin out. The place you see on the map is called the Maxentius Basilica, where people have been celebrating since Roman times - there will be a grand party and you can see the peak when it ends that day. This is just one example of how we perceive this city today in a way we couldn't do a few years ago. Another brief example of perception: this is not about people, but about what we use and consume. Today, we know where everything comes from. Here's a map showing you how all the components of an Apple computer are assembled together. But we rarely know where these components end up when they are discarded. So for this project, we actually invented some small tags to track this waste and make it move in the system. In fact, we and some volunteers in Seattle, who were willing to help us, just one year ago, put labels on things people threw away - different kinds of things, like the ones you see here - things we had to throw away anyway. We put small integrated blocks, small tags, on the trash and then started tracking it. This is what we observed. From Seattle... one week later. From this information, we realized that there was too much inefficient operation in the system. I could actually do the same thing with less energy. This data was not previously available. But a lot of garbage transport and puzzling things happened. There is another thing that we firmly believe: if we think about the cups we throw away every day, they haven't disappeared, they are still in some corner of the earth. The plastic bottles we throw away every day will still be there. If we show this to people, then we can promote some behavioral changes. So that's the significance of this project. My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman, will tell you more about perception and the many wonderful things we can do with perception, but I want to start with the second part, which is actually about our environment. The first project is about what we did in Zaragoza, Spain a few years ago. It started with a question from the mayor, who came to us and said that in Spain, and even in southern Europe, there is a tradition of using water resources efficiently in public places through architecture. The question is: how can new technologies enhance this? One of the ideas comes from an R&D group at MIT, and it's about imagining a pipeline. You have its valves, solenoid valves, meters, turn on and off. You create a water curtain using water as pixels. If these pixels fall, you can create on them, show flowers, images, text. When you get close to it, it even closes to let you pass, just like this picture you see. We showed this to Mayor Belloc. He loved it. Then we got permission to build a building at the entrance of the Expo. We call it the Digital Water Pavilion. The entire building is built with water. There are no doors or windows, but when you walk into it, it automatically opens up to let you in. The roof is also covered with water. If it's a bit windy and you want less water to splash, you can actually lower the roof. Or you could even close the whole building, and the building would disappear, just like this. These days, you'll often see this in winter when they lower the roof. People who go there say, "They're demolishing this building." No, they're not demolishing it, it's just that when it lowers, the building itself almost disappears. That's how water architecture works. You can see people are puzzled about how to get in. This is me trying not to get wet while testing the water curtain sensor. I should tell you what happened one night. All the sensors stopped working. But it made that night more interesting. All the children in Zaragoza gathered here because the way to enter the building became somewhat different. The building no longer opens automatically for you to enter, but the water curtain still separates the building into different spaces, so you can't avoid getting wet by skipping this one. Meanwhile, for us, it's also very interesting because as an architect, an engineer, a designer, we often consider how people use what we design. But reality is always surprising. This is also the charm of doing these things - use and interaction coexist. This is a picture made of physical pixels and water, and then projected upon. It also reminds me of the next project I want to show you. Imagine these pixels can fly. Imagine you have a small helicopter that can move in the air, and each one has a small pixel that can change color - almost like a cloud that can move in the air. Watch a video. Imagine a helicopter, like the one we just saw, moving synchronously with other helicopters. Then you get this cloud. You would get a flexible screen or display board, like this one -- a two-dimensional regular configuration. Or a regular one, but in 3D, where what changes are the highlights, not the position of the pixels. You can use different methods. Imagine your display screen can project different sizes or scales, with different resolutions. But everything is just a 3D cloud of pixels, and you can zoom in and go through it, viewing it from many, many angles. This is a controlled descent forming a standard grid, just like before. When you turn on the light, you actually see this, the same as before. Imagine if each one of these were controlled by people. You could give every pixel an input from people's movements and actions. I will show you some things exhibited for the first time. We are working with Roberto Bolle, one of the top ballet dancers today -- a star of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and Milan's La Scala Opera House -- to capture his 3D movements in real time, so you can see Roberto dancing. You can see the different pixels on the left, and they are all real-time 3D scans and dynamic captures. This way, you can reproduce the entire dance routine. You can keep dancing like this. However, once you have these pixels, you can manipulate them with color and motion, gravity and rotation. We want to use this as a possible input for flying fire. I want to show you the last project we are working on. It is what we did for the London Olympics. Title: Digital Cloud The idea behind this project is, once again, to harness our imagination and encourage everyone to participate in changing the environment - by sponsoring the construction of our digital cloud, similar to the construction of a barn. Imagine if everyone could donate the cost of one pixel. What has happened in the past few years is remarkable. Over the past few decades, we have witnessed the transformation from the physical world to the digital world. Today, electronic products, knowledge, and access to the Internet are ubiquitous. For the first time today, Obama's campaign tells us that we can use the power of spontaneous network organization to return to the physical world from the digital world. It is feasible, and in our example, we want to use it to design and create a logo. It will mean building certain buildings in the city. But in the future, it can solve the challenges that are increasingly approaching us - such as climate change or carbon emissions - and how we can return from the digital world to the physical world. So, in fact, we can get everyone involved in doing this together. This digital cloud is a cloud, and it is formed by pixels in a way that mimics the formation of clouds in reality, using particles to form a cloud-like structure. These particles are water, and this digital cloud is composed of pixels. It is located in London, and you can step into it to experience a unique sensation. You can actually see the important moments of the 2012 Olympics from below and use it as a bridge to connect with society. At the same time, there are clouds in the sky and some that you can reach at the top, like the new peak of London. You can enter it. This is a new digital torch at night, but the most important thing is that it creates an experience that anyone can reach the summit. Thank you.
If you could be better than you are now, what would you want to be like? For example, your genes could be modified to give you better memory, greater precision, accuracy, and speed. Or maybe you want to become healthier, stronger, and have more energy. Do you want to become more attractive and confident? How about being able to live a healthy life for a long time? Or do you want to have more creativity? What do you want the most? If you could only have one thing, what would you want? (Audience: Creativity.) Creativity. How many people would choose creativity? Raise your hand, let me see. Some. Perhaps as many as there are creative people here. That's great. How many want memory? More. How about health? Fewer. Longevity? Ah, most. As a doctor, I'm happy to see this. If you could have one of these changes, the world would be very different." Is this just speculation? Or is it possible? Evolution is a permanent topic at TED. But today, I want to tell you about the perspective of a doctor on this topic. T. Dobzhansky, a famous geneticist in the 20th century, and also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church, once wrote an article called "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." Now, if you don't believe in the evidence of biological evolution, you can turn off your hearing aid now, take out your personal communication device - you have permission - or reread Kathryn Schulz's book about being wrong. Because for the rest of this talk, you will feel meaningless. But if you believe in the theory of biological evolution, think about this: is it about the past or the future? Is it about what happens to other organisms or what happens to us too? This is a tree of life. In this picture, I let the tree branch out from the center to all directions, because if you look at the corners of the tree of life, every existing species is successful at the tips of those branches, using the language of evolution, and adapted to its environment. The human part, in this branch, is at the end of one of the corners, which of course is what we are most interested in. We branched out from a common ancestor and separated from modern chimpanzees about 6 or 8 million years ago. During this time, there were probably 20 to 25 humanoid species. Some came and went. We have been here for 130,000 years. It seems that we are far away from the other species on this tree of life. But in fact, at many levels, the basic structures that make up our cells are almost the same. Did you know that we can use and apply the structure of a common bacterium to make human insulin protein used to treat diabetes? This is not human insulin; it is the same protein that is difficult to distinguish from what our pancreas generates from a biochemical perspective. Speaking of bacteria, did you know that there are more bacteria in our stomachs than cells in our bodies? Maybe 10 times more. When Antonio Damasio asks you about your personal self-image, would you think of bacteria? Our intestines are a very suitable environment for those bacteria. It's warm, dark, damp, and quite comfortable. And we also provide them with almost all the nutrients they need, which they don't have to work for. For bacteria, this is really a carefree life, although there is the occasional disturbance when they are unwillingly expelled. Nevertheless, for bacteria, you are an excellent living environment, and their presence is essential to your life. They help digest the nutrients you need and they also help protect you from some diseases. But what will the future hold? Are we already in evolutionary balance as a species? Or is our fate to become a different species, one that may be better adapted to the environment? Now let's go back to the time of the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago - the Earth, the solar system, about 4.5 billion years ago - the first signs of primitive life, perhaps 3 or 4 billion years ago on Earth - the first multicellular organism, about 800 million or 1 billion years ago - and finally, the appearance of humans as a species in the last 130,000 years. In this vast and unfinished symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a simple musical score; animals are single notes and humans are decorative embellishments. That's us. And that's the interesting part of this talk, which I hope you will enjoy. When I was a freshman in college, I took my first biology class. I was amazed that biology was elegant and beautiful. I became fascinated by the power of evolution and realized something fundamental: in most forms of life, in single-celled organisms, the simple structure of each cell and all its genetic energy are inherited by daughter cells. But when multicellular organisms emerged, things started to change. Sexual reproduction entered the picture. And it is crucial that the genes passed on by sexual reproduction become expendable, while other parts do not. In fact, you could say that our partial mortality is a necessity that occurs simultaneously with evolution and sexual reproduction. Now, I have to say, when I was a college student, I thought, well, sex/death, sex/death, dying for sex – that sounded reasonable at the time, but as the years went by, I started having a lot of questions. I started to understand George Burns, who had been performing in Las Vegas until he was 90. One night, someone knocked on the door of the hotel room where he was staying. He opened the door, and there was a beautiful, scantily clad showgirl standing there. She looked at him and said, "I'm here to make love." "Okay," George said, "I'll have the soup." I began to realize that as a doctor, the direction I had been working towards was different from the direction of evolution - not an absolute contradiction, but different. I have always been striving to keep us healthy. I began to realize that as a doctor, the direction I have been striving for is different from the direction of evolution - it's not an absolute contradiction, just different. I have always been striving to keep us healthy, to help us recover from disease, and to live longer and healthier lives. Evolution, on the other hand, is about passing on genes to the next generation, adapting and surviving from one generation to the next. From an evolutionary perspective, we are like rocket boosters designed to send "genetic" payloads to the next orbital layer and then fall into the ocean. I think we should all understand what Woody Allen said: "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work, I want to achieve immortality through not dying." Evolution is not necessarily about living longer. It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or strongest, or the fastest, or even the smartest. Evolution favors those who can best adapt to their environment. This is a single test of survival. In the depths of the ocean, bacteria are heat-resistant and can survive in hot steam. Otherwise, if there were fish there, there would be sous-vide fish, but bacteria can still live in a comfortable environment. So, what does this mean when we look back at what happened during the process of evolution, and when we think about humans in evolution, especially as we look up to the next stage? I can only say that there are many possibilities. The first possibility is that we will not evolve anymore. We have reached a certain balance point. The reasons behind this could be, first, through medicine, we can preserve many genes that would otherwise have been eliminated and removed from most people. Secondly, we are a species that can adapt our environment, making the environment adapt to us and us adapt to the environment. In addition, we migrate, circulate, and mix together, so you are not in an isolated state, and this is a necessary condition for evolution to occur. The second possibility is still the traditional form of evolution, driven by the forces of nature. The controversy here is that the wheel of evolution turns slowly and cannot be stopped. Only isolated phenomena exist, and as a species, we dominate a distant planet, there will be isolated phenomena, and environmental changes will lead to evolution in a natural way. However, there is a third possibility, a tempting, interesting, and exciting possibility. I call it "new evolution" - a new way of evolution. It is not a simple natural way but a guided and selective way, promoted by us as individuals making choices. Now, how can this happen? Let's consider reality first. Nowadays, some people in certain cultures make choices for their offspring. Among some cultures, they choose more boys than girls. This is certainly not a good thing for the whole society, but it is a choice made by individuals and families. Think about it, if you could choose, not just choose the gender of your child, but choose to make some gene adjustments in your body that could cure or prevent diseases. If you could really make some gene adjustments to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease, reduce the incidence of cancer, or eliminate stroke, wouldn't you want to make those changes to your genes? If we look ahead, these changes will be very likely. The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and took 13 years. It cost 2.7 billion US dollars. In 2004, after the project was completed, you could do the same thing for 20 million US dollars in three to four months. Today, you can get a complete genome sequence containing three billion base pairs of the human genome for about 20,000 US dollars, in about a week. It won't be long before we can achieve a thousand-dollar human genome, and more and more people can do it. Just a week ago, the National Academy of Engineering awarded the Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and William S. Muller, two scientists who independently developed technology to make the natural evolutionary process faster and produce more desirable proteins more effectively. Francis Arnold called it "directed evolution." Years ago, the Lasker Prize was awarded to scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research on taking a mature skin cell, a fibroblast, and by manipulating just four genes, guiding that cell to revert to a pluripotent stem cell - a cell that has the potential to become any cell in our bodies. These changes are ongoing. The same technology can generate human insulin from bacteria that produce viruses. This will not only protect you against them but also produce immunity to other viruses. Do you believe that there is an experiment studying a vaccine for influenza that is being cultivated from a tobacco plant cell? Can you imagine that tobacco can have something beneficial? These are all realities today, and in the future, there will be more possibilities. Think about two other small changes. If you can change the cells in your own body, what if you could change the cells of your descendants? If you could change sperm and eggs, or change new fertilized eggs, it could give your offspring a better chance of a healthier life - eliminating diabetes, hemophilia, and reducing the chance of cancer? Who wouldn't want healthier children? By then, the same analytical technology and scientific techniques that can produce changes that defend against diseases, can also integrate some super attributes and advanced abilities - better memory. Why not have the wit of Ken Jennings, especially if you could have the same intelligence as the next-generation Watson computer system? Why not quickly contract muscles to make us run faster and longer? Why not live longer? These are all irresistible. And when we are in a position to pass on to the next generation, we can integrate the abilities we want, and we will change the evolution of the old model to the new evolution. We will have such a process that usually takes 100,000 years, but we can compress it to a thousand years - maybe even in the next 100 years. These changes will be possessed by our grandchildren or their grandchildren. Will they use these choices to create a better society? A more successful, friendlier society? Or will we selectively choose different abilities to change some of us rather than others? Will we create a society that is more boring and uniform? Or healthier and more diverse? These are all questions we have to face. And most importantly, can we advance intelligence or inherit intelligence to make these choices more wisely? For better or for worse, we will face these choices faster than you can imagine. Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion. When you're at an altitude of over 3,000 feet, imagine the cabin filled with black smoke, and the engines making a terrifying banging sound. My seat, 1D, was in a unique position, as I was the only person who could speak to the flight attendants. So I looked at them, and they said, "It's okay, we probably just hit a bird." The captain had already turned the plane towards our destination, and we were close enough to see Manhattan. Two minutes later, three things happened at once. The captain turned the plane towards the Hudson River. The usual flight path was not like this. He turned off the engines. Imagine a plane with no sound. Then he said a few words. I heard the most emotionless words I've ever heard. He said, "We're going to make an emergency landing. Brace for impact." I didn't need to ask the flight attendant anything anymore. I could see the fear in her eyes. Life was over. "Now I want to share with you the three things I learned that day. Everything changed in an instant. Our life goals list - all those things we want to do, all those people I wanted to contact but didn't, the walls and relationships I should have mended, all the experiences I wanted to have but never did. Afterwards, when I thought about those things, I came up with a saying: 'The wine I kept for special occasions has gone sour.' Because if the wine had been ready and the company had been there, I probably would have opened it. I know that now. There would have been no postponement. That urgency that purpose changed my life. The second thing I learned that day was that as we were crossing over the George Washington Bridge, which was not long before everything happened, I thought, "Wow, I only have one regret: even though I've made mistakes, my life isn't too bad." I tried to do everything better." But because of human nature, I am inevitably somewhat self-centered. I regret that I spent so much time and life discussing unimportant things with important people in my life. I thought about my relationship with my wife, my friends, and people. Afterwards, as I thought about this, I decided to eliminate the negative emotions in my life. I haven't completely achieved it, but it's much better. In the past two years, I have never quarreled with my wife, and it feels good. I no longer try to argue right and wrong. I choose happiness. The third thing I learned is that when the clock in your mind starts counting down "15, 14, 13", and you see the water level next to you begin to rise. "Please explode. I don't want this thing to break into 20 pieces like in a documentary." As we gradually sank, I suddenly felt that death wasn't scary, as if we had been preparing for it all along, but it was very sad. I don't want to leave like this because I love my life. The main source of this sadness is that I only expect one thing, and that is to see my children grow up. A month later, I attended my daughter's performance. She was in the first grade and didn't have much talent in the arts, but even so, I burst into tears like a child. It gave my world new meaning. At that moment, I realized that the only important thing in my life was to be a good father. It's more important than anything else. My only goal in life is to be a good father. That day, I experienced a miracle. I survived and at the same time, I received another revelation. It was like seeing my own future. Coming back again, I changed my life. I encourage all of you who are flying today to imagine if the same thing happened to you - hopefully not - but imagine, how would you change? What are the things you want to do but haven't done because you think you'll have other opportunities? How would you change your relationships to be less negative? Most importantly, have you done your best to be a good parent? Thank you, everyone.
I have had the privilege of participating in many amazing projects in my life. But the coolest project I've ever worked on is related to this guy. This guy's name is TEMPT. TEMPT was one of the earliest graffiti artists in the 1980s. One day, he came home after running and said, "Dad, my legs feel a little numb." This was the early symptom of ALS. TEMPT is now completely paralyzed. Only his eyes can move. I have had contact with him. I have a design and animation company, and graffiti is obviously a complex part of art that we admire and respect in the art world. Therefore, we decided to become sponsors of Tony, also known as TEMPT. I went to find his brother and father and said, "We are planning to give you some money. What will you use it for?" His brother said, "I just want to be able to chat with Tony again. I just want to be able to communicate with him and for him to be able to communicate with me." I said, "Wait, I've met Stephen Hawking before. Don't all paralyzed people communicate with others through those devices?" He replied, "No, unless you are part of the upper class and have a significant amount of insurance, it's impossible to get those devices. They're not that easy to obtain." I said, "Okay, how do you communicate then?" Have you seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"? That is the way they communicate - by moving their fingers. "This method is too outdated. How could this be?" I said. My intention when I appeared was just to write a check, but instead, I wrote a check that I had no idea how to cash. At that time, I made a promise to his brother and father - the gist of it was, "Okay, here's the deal: Tony will be able to speak, we'll get him a machine, and we'll find a way for him to create again. Because it's just ridiculous for a person who is still mentally sound but unable to communicate."A few months later, I gave a speech at a conference. I met these guys called GRL, the Graffiti Research Lab, who had a technology that allowed them to project a beam of light onto any surface and then draw on it with a laser pen, creating a dark gap. They roamed around and showcased art like this. They called all of these things a lifecycle. It started with genitalia, then profanity, followed by slandering Bush, and then people saw art. But their exhibition always implied a life cycle. When I returned home and had dinner with my wife, I told her about it, roughly saying, "Wait, if we know this technology can allow you to control things with your eyes, why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser beam so that he can do graffiti again, that would be awesome." So we started to take action. About two years later, after going through many organizations and changing some circumstances, we accomplished something. First, we broke down the door of an insurance company and we really gave TEMPT a machine that allowed him to communicate - a Stephen Hawking-style machine. That was awesome. He really was the most interesting person - I called him Yoda because when you talk to him, he sends you an email and you feel like, "I can't do it. This guy is too amazing." Another thing we did was we gathered seven programmers from all over the world - no exaggeration, they came from every corner of the world - and brought them together here. My wife, children, and I moved into the back garage, and these hackers, programmers, conspiracy theorists, and anarchists took over our house. Many of our friends thought we were so stupid for doing this. When we returned to the house, the pictures on the wall would be taken down, and the walls would be covered in messy scribbles. But after two weeks, two weeks into it, we went to Venice Beach, my kids came with me, my dog came with me, and we built this thing. We call it the eye-writer, and you can see the instructions for it. It's just a cheap pair of sunglasses that we got on the Venice Boardwalk, some copper wire, and some stuff we got from Home Depot and Radio Shack. We took apart a PS3 camera, mounted it on an LED light, and now this device is free - you can make it yourself, we've released the source code, you can download it for free. Now we can make this device completely unencumbered. No insurance company can say "no." No hospital can say "no." Anyone who's paralyzed can now paint and communicate just with their eyes. Thank you. Thank you very much. This is great. After two weeks, we returned to TEMPT's room. I like this photo because it's someone else's room, it's his room. All the crowding and noise were for this momentous occasion. After over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, fast food, and all-night meetings, Tony started painting for the first time in seven years. It was a stunning sight because it was his life support system that he was carefully observing. We shook his bed so he could see. We set up a projector on a wall outside his hospital room, in the parking lot. He started painting again, in front of his family and friends - you can imagine what it was like in the parking lot. Interestingly, we squeezed into the parking lot, so we felt like we were a part of the entire graffiti piece as well. At the end of it all, he sent us an email that said, "This is the first time in seven years that I've been able to paint." "I felt like I've been held under water all this time, and finally someone reached out and pulled my head above water so I can breathe." Isn't this amazing? It's a bit like our battle cry. It's what keeps us moving forward and developing. We've come such a long way to get to this point. This is a great device, but it's different from sketching and engraving. Someone with this kind of artistic potential deserves more. We're still in the process of exploring how to make it better, faster, and more powerful. Since then, we've received various recognitions and won many awards. Please remember, it's free; none of us are making a penny off of this. All expenses are out of our own pockets. Our reward is "oh, that's awesome." Armstrong tweeted about us, and then in December, Time magazine honored us as one of the 50 Best Inventions of 2010, which was really cool. The coolest thing is - this completes the whole circle - in April of this year, there will be an exhibition called "Street Art" at the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA in downtown Los Angeles. And "Street Art" is going to have a lot of the street art bad guys - Banksy, Shepard Fairey, CAW - all these guys are going to be there. TEMPT is going to be there too, which is really cool. So my basic point is: if you see something that seems impossible, make it possible. Everything that has happened in this room was impossible - this stage, this computer, this mic, this eye-writing device - all of it was impossible at one point. It's each person in this room that made it possible. I am not a programmer and have never done anything related to eye movement recognition technology. But I just had some ideas and connected myself with some amazing people, so we could come up with something. I just want everyone to ask themselves a question every day when they think of something they feel should be done. If not now, when? If not me, who? Thank you.
In the past few years, I have put myself in both harsh and somewhat dangerous situations. I have been to prison - harsh, worked in a coal mine - dangerous, and filmed in war zones - both harsh and dangerous. I once ate only one type of food for 30 days - it was interesting at first, then became difficult, and finally quite dangerous. In fact, for most of my career, I have put myself in difficult situations in order to study social problems in a more engaging and interesting way, with the hope of presenting these issues in the form of entertainment for the audience. So when I found out that I would be giving a TED talk here about branding and sponsorship, I knew I wanted to do something different. Some of you may have heard a few weeks ago, I posted an ad on eBay and some information on Facebook and Twitter, giving people the chance to purchase the naming rights to my 2011 TED talk. That's right, some lucky individual or company, for-profit or non-profit, will have the only chance in their lifetime - because I'm sure Chris Anderson would never allow this to happen again - to buy the naming rights to the talk you are watching right now. At the time, the talk didn't have a title or much content, and no hints about the theme were given. So what you get is: Your name here: You have no idea what my TED talk is about, and its content will ultimately determine whether or not I screw it up. If I embarrass you and your company, the likelihood is high. But on the other hand, this is a great advertising opportunity. Do you know how many people watch TED talks? There are a lot of people. By the way, this is just a provisional title for the talk. Despite this statement, I still believe someone will buy the naming rights. If you had asked me a year ago, I wouldn't have been so bold. But in my new project, my new film that I'm preparing, we're going to explore the marketing and advertising world. As I said before, I've put myself in terrible situations over the years, but compared to that, the most challenging, the most bitter, and the most dangerous experience is being in the same room with these people. You see, I have a film concept like this. Morgan Spurlock: I want to make a film about product placement, marketing, and advertising. And the film's sponsorship will come from product placement, marketing, and advertising. The name of this film will be "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold." "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold" from top to bottom, from start to finish, is filled with brands - from the sponsors at the beginning of the film, like Brand X, Qualcomm Stadium, Staples Center... These people's lives are forever linked to this film - forever. This movie explores the idea - Michael Canzoniero: This is repetitive. - Repetitive? (Michael Canzoniero: This is repetitive.) I tend to repeat myself. (Michael Canzoniero: I'm just teasing.) It's to emphasize that it's "forever. forever." But we're not just going to point out a certain brand sponsor, we're going to sell every line of products that brand has in the film. That way, we sell a pair of shoes and those shoes become the most comfortable shoes ever sold... The cars in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold" will be the best cars ever driven, and the drinks will be the best ever tasted, making the movie the greatest ever sold. Xavier Kochhar: So, it's not just about showing that brands are a part of people's lives, but getting those brands to sponsor the movie? (Morgan Spurlock: Getting those brands to sponsor the movie.) Morgan Spurlock: Actually, we're going to show the entire marketing process. The purpose of making this movie is transparency. In the movie, you will witness the entire brand marketing process. That's the whole concept of the movie. From beginning to end, it will be threaded through the movie. I hope CEG can lend me a hand. Robert Friedman: What's interesting is, when I first heard this idea, I thought it was the most respectful thing you could do to the audience, but I don't know if people will accept it. Xavier Kochhar: Do you have any expectations - I don't want to use the word "stance" because it sounds negative - what kind of result do you think this movie will have? (Morgan Spurlock: I don't know.) David Cohen: How much money will it take to make this movie? One and a half million dollars. (David Cohen: Okay.) John Carman: I think it will be very difficult to deal with these big brands, but seeking their support is definitely worth a try. Xavier Kochhar: Who knows, after your movie is made, we might end up looking like a bunch of fools. Morgan Spurlock: Do you think they'll say yes? Stuart Rutherford: Most of them will say no. Morgan Spurlock: Is it because of the movie itself or because of me personally? John Carmen: Both. Morgan Spurlock: This doesn't look good, gentlemen. Can you help me? I need help. Michael Karnjanaprakorn: I can help you. Morgan Spurlock: That's great. Michael Karnjanaprakorn: We have to lock down the brands. Sherlock: Exactly. (Michael Kenison: It's very difficult.) Those people you're going to deal with... Michael Kenison: We have some connections. (Sherlock: Okay.) Turn off the camera. Sherlock: I thought "turn off the camera" meant to have a private discussion, but it actually meant "we don't want anything to do with your film." Sherlock: And just like that, one by one, all these companies disappeared. Not a single one was interested in supporting this project. I was very surprised. I thought the idea and essence of advertising was to showcase your product to as many people as possible and let as many people as possible know about it. Especially in today's world where old and new media intersect and in the fragmented media world, shouldn't we use a new way of delivering information to the general public? No, that's just my personal opinion. The problem is, you see, my idea has a fatal flaw. The flaw is right here. Actually, no, there's nothing wrong with it. This isn't the problem. This is acceptable. But this image represents the problem. You see, if you search "transparency" in Google Images, this is one of the top results -- this is it. I like your style, Sergei Brin. Here's the problem: transparency -- no fakery. Transparency and openness. Simple and easy to understand. It has the characteristics of visible and easy-to-obtain information, and is closely related to business operations -- the last one may be the biggest problem. You see, lately we've been hearing a lot about transparency. Our politicians, our president, and even our CEOs are using this term. However, when it comes to putting it into practice, the situation suddenly changes. Why? Transparency is a fierce beast - like this bear that is frozen in time but still roaring. It is unpredictable, just like this strange country road that looks so dangerous. So what else is dangerous? Eating a whole bowl of Cool Whip ice cream is pretty dangerous. When I started talking to the company and told them we wanted to tell this story, they said, "Oh, of course we want you to tell stories. We want you to tell our story. would say, "Son, every story has three sides: your story, my story, and the real story." You see, we hope to tell the real story through this movie, and only one company is willing to help me--because I have had many years of friendship with John Bond and Richard Curtis. I realized that it's better to rely on myself than others. I have to skip the middlemen and negotiate directly with those companies with my team. Suddenly, or when I started to realize, you start to understand--or when I started to understand--that understanding your own brand when you start talking to these companies is a common problem. Spurlock: I have two friends who make big Hollywood movies. I also know friends who make low-budget independent films like me. My friends who make Hollywood movies tell me that the reason their movies are successful is because of their brand sponsors. My friends who make low-budget independent films ask, "How can we make these big Hollywood movies?" And such a movie is called "the most popular movie in history." So how will we look at the brand Ban in the film? Whenever I'm about to go out, whenever I open the cabinet, you'll see Ban deodorant. Whenever I have a conversation with someone, I'll say, "Are you feeling fresh enough for our talk today? Are you ready? You look a little nervous. Let me help you relax. Maybe you can use some before our talk." We'll put out these pleasant deodorants, whether it's "Floral Breeze" or "Heavenly Essence." There's always one that suits you. We'll introduce these products to both men and women - solid, roll-on, or cream deodorant, all available. That's the general situation. Now, I'll answer any questions you may have so that you can learn more about it. Karen Frank: We are a relatively unknown brand, just like you mentioned with low-budget movies. We are a brand that has just started out, and we don't have the financial resources of other big brands to conduct the kind of promotion that would generate attention for Ban. That's what makes it attractive to us. Morgan Spurlock: How would you describe the Ban brand? What's so special about Ban? Karen Frank: Good question. (Everyone laughs) Woman: State-of-the-art technology. Morgan Spurlock: Technology isn't the best descriptor. Deodorant is a product that people put under their arms. Man: We talked about boldness, freshness. I think "freshness" is a positive portrayal of this product line, which corresponds to "inhibiting odor, dryness and comfort." It makes you feel fresh. How do you keep your body fresh for a long time - more fresh, three times fresh? All of these can have positive effects. That is a business group with assets of several million. But what about me? How do I think as an ordinary person? I need to ask people on the street. They, like me, are ordinary passers-by. They need to tell them their own brand. Spurlock: How would you describe your brand? Man: My brand? I don't know. I like really good clothes. I like the retro style of the 80s. Unless today is laundry day. Sherlock: Okay, Grey, what is a brand? Grey: Different from others. (Sherlock: Different from others) Man: I think it's my unique style. It should be "Dark Fascination". I like black, gray, and similar things. I usually wear accessories like sunglasses. I also like crystal accessories. Woman: If Dan is a brand, he might be a classic convertible, like Mercedes-Benz. Man 2: My brand, I would call it "Unconventional". Woman 2: A bit hippie, a bit yoga, and a bit of a Brooklyn girl's taste - I don't know. Man 3: I like to keep pets. My pet toys are sold all over the country, even around the world. I think that's my brand. In this twisted little industry, that's my brand. Man 4: My brand is "FedEx," I'm a delivery guy. Man 5: "Drunken, down-and-out writer" brand. Does that count? Lawyer: My brand is lawyer. Tom: I'm "Tom's brand". Sherlock: But we can't all be "Tom's brand," but I often find myself a combination of "dark and charming" and "unconventional". I realized that what I needed was an expert. I needed someone who could understand what I really wanted, someone who could truly help me understand the concept of "brand personality". So, I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburgh. They have helped brands like Nestle, Procter & Gamble's Febreze, Herman Miller, etc. discover their brand personality. If they could help those brands, then they could certainly help me. Abigail: Did you bring the pictures with you? Sherlock: Yes, I did. The first picture is a family portrait of mine. Abigail: Can you tell me how this picture relates to how you feel about yourself? Sherlock: These people helped shape my view of the world. Abigail: What kind of world is that? Sherlock: This world? I think your world is the world you live in - all the people around you, your friends, family, your lifestyle, your work. All of this has a place where it grows and takes root. For me, that place is my home in West Virginia. Abigail: And the next picture? Sherlock: The next one: this is my happiest day. Abigail: What does this have to do with how you see yourself? Sherlock: It's related to what kind of person I want to be. I like new and strange things. I like weird things. Abigail: Tell me "why" - how does this help us? What does the curved blade represent? Which phase of gestation are you in now? Rebuilding and regrouping, why is it so important? What does the color red represent? Please explain this part. Tell me what doesn't match your style. What transformations have you gone through? It doesn't necessarily have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you riding? Sherlock: Yikes...! (Abigail: Thank you.) No, thank you. Abigail: Thank you for your patient cooperation. (Sherlock: You did great.) Abigail: Really? (Sherlock: Thank you very much.) Okay. Well, I don't know how it's going to end up. There are too many complex and intricate things involved. Lindsay Zoltan: The initial impression of this idea is that there are two very different but complementary sides to your brand personality -- the Morgan Spurlock brand is both thoughtful and irreverent. Combining these two aspects is very effective, but they can also be contradictory. I think some companies tend to focus only on one of their strengths and neglect the other. Most companies tend to avoid things they are unsure about or afraid of, but you do the opposite and turn them into positive factors, which is great. What are some similar brands? The first one is the most classic, Apple. There is also Target, Wii Mini Coopers' Mini, and JetBlue. Some brands are "playful", while others have depth of thought, and these brands do not last long. But a brand that has both depth of thought and playfulness is very powerful. Sherlock: A brand that is playful and thoughtful. So, how would you describe your brand positioning and personality if someone asked you to do so? Are you high-profile? Do you make people excited? Or are you a low-key brand? Is your brand more calm, reserved, and conservative? High-profile brands are generally more playful, like Fresh Prince, novel, fashionable, adventurous, avant-garde, bold, agile, flexible, worldly, and domineering, like Errol Flynn, magical and mysterious like Gandalf. Or is your brand more low-key, thoughtful and worldly-wise like James Bond? Are you famous, traditional, diligent, conservative, and emotional like Oprah? Are you trustworthy, stable, familiar, safe, reliable, sacred, full of thought and wisdom like the Dalai Lama or Yoda (Star Wars character)? In this film, we found over 500 high-profile or low-key brands that said "no" and did not want to be associated with the film, mainly because they did not have control over the final product. But in the end, we got 17 cooperating companies who were willing to give up control. They were willing to work with someone like me who had both ideas and a devil-may-care attitude. They gave us the power to tell stories - stories that advertisers had never explored in depth. They let us tell stories about neuromarketing. In the film, we introduced how they use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology to find the areas of your brain that control desires, and then make advertisements and marketing films. We went to São Paulo, a city that has banned outdoor advertising for a full five years. There were no billboards, posters, or any promotional materials. We went to the school district, where companies try to advertise in every financially strained school in America. What surprised me the most was that the things that got the most feedback or the greatest returns were the things I personally dealt with. These brands did things differently. They skipped intermediaries because they believed that these intermediaries might not have put their interests first. I negotiated directly with artists and created an extraordinary film with them, allowing people to gain insights from it. This will overturn our view of the world. What impact did this have on people? Was it successful? The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Let's take a look. According to data from Burrelles, since the film's premiere in January, and this isn't even the full film, we've received 900 million media impressions about the film. All the coverage adds up to two and a half weeks. And this is just online – it doesn't include newspapers, magazines, or television. The film hasn't even been released yet. It's not available online or in any other countries. In the end, this film has received widespread attention. It's a good achievement for a film like this. All of the advertising companies we talked to at the time advised their clients not to participate. I have always believed that if you dare to try, dare to take risks, these risks will become opportunities. I believe that when you don't let people take risks, you are pushing them towards failure. I believe that when you educate your employees not to take risks, you are putting the entire company's interests in danger. I think that in order to make progress, we must encourage people to take risks. We must encourage people not to be afraid of seemingly dangerous opportunities. Ultimately, we must move forward courageously. I believe we must face our fears, put the bear in the cage, face our fears, face the risks one by one, and eventually, we must embrace transparency. Now, more than ever, a little bit of integrity can produce strong vitality. As I've said, through honesty and transparency, my entire talk "Embrace Transparency" was sponsored and broadcasted by my friends at EMC. They purchased the naming rights for $7100 on eBay. EMC: Turning big data into huge opportunities for the benefit of global enterprises. Thank you so much. Joan Cooney: So, Morgan, in the spirit of transparency, where did that $7100 go? Spurlock: That's a great question. I have a check in my pocket for $7100 from the TED parent company, the Sapling Foundation, as my appearance fee for next year's TED.
The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually very simple. We do not want Iran to have nuclear weapons. The main facility where they are developing these weapons is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The gray box that you see is a real-time control system. If we can somehow infiltrate the system that controls the speed of the centrifuges and the valves, we can actually cause a lot of problems. This gray box cannot run Windows software; they use completely different technology. But if we can somehow put a Windows virus on a laptop used by a device engineer to configure this gray box, then we can start to take action. This is the conspiracy behind the Stuxnet virus. So I started with a Windows injector. It carried the virus to the gray box, destroyed the centrifuges, delayed the Iranian nuclear project - and the mission was accomplished. It's easy, right? I want to tell you how we discovered this. When we started studying the Stuxnet worm six months ago, we knew nothing about its purpose. The only thing we knew was that its Windows component and injector component were very, very complex and used multiple zero-day exploits. It seemed to want to do something to these gray boxes, these real-time control systems. This caught our attention, and we launched a lab project to infect our systems with the Stuxnet worm and examine it carefully. Then some very interesting things happened. The Stuxnet worm behaved like a cheese-averse laboratory rat - it sniffed the cheese, but didn't want to eat it. I didn't understand it. After we experimented with different cheeses, I realized that this was a targeted attack. It's completely targeted. The injector actively infiltrates the gray box, even if the actual program it's trying to infect is doing the same thing. If it doesn't find a target, the Stuxnet worm does nothing. This really caught my attention, and we worked around the clock to study it, because I felt we still didn't know its target. The target may be, for example, a US power plant or a German chemical plant. So we'd better find out its target as soon as possible. We extracted and decompiled the attack code and found that it contained two digital bombs -- one smaller and one larger. And we also discovered that they were made very professionally by people who knew all the insider information about the target they wanted to attack. They even knew the shoe size of the operator. They know everything. If you've ever heard that the quake network virus injector is complex and high-tech, let me tell you: the virus it carries is very complex. It far exceeds the technology we have ever seen. Here you can see an actual fragment of the attack code. We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code. It looks a lot like old-style assembly language. I want to tell you how we figured out this code. The first thing we're looking for is system function calls, because we know what these functions do. Then we need to find timers and data structures and try to connect them to the real world - to potential real world targets. Therefore, we need a target theory that we can use to confirm or deny. To obtain a target theory, we remembered that this would absolutely cause severe destruction, so there must be a high-value target, and it is likely located in Iran, because the most virus infections have been reported there. Not many targets will be found in this area. Basically, the target can be narrowed down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and the Natanz uranium enrichment plant. So I said to my assistant, "Give me a list of all the centrifuge and power plant experts in our client group." I called them and asked them to help analyze our findings in the code and data using their professional knowledge. This was very useful. We were able to link this small digital warhead to the rotor controller. This rotor is the moving component inside the centrifuge, the black object you see. If the speed of this rotor is controlled, it can actually crack the rotor and even eventually cause the centrifuge to explode. We also saw that the purpose of the attack was to make all of this terrifying thing happen slowly - apparently this would drive maintenance engineers crazy, and they couldn't find the problem quickly. The large digital warhead - by carefully observing the data and data structure, we have the opportunity to understand it. For example, the number 164 is very eye-catching in these codes; it cannot be ignored. I started to study how these separators were built in the scientific literature related to Natanz, and found that they were organized into something called a hierarchy, each level containing 164 centrifuges. This is a bit clear and matched. Even better matched. In Iran, these centrifuges are divided into 15 so-called units. Guess what we found in the attack code? Almost identical unit structures. Therefore, it matched well again, giving us more confidence in the work we are doing. Now don't get me wrong, it's not done like this. These results contain weeks of our hard work. We often hit dead ends and end up back where we started. In any case, we found these two digital warheads that target the same target from different angles. The small warhead selects a level, accelerates the rotor, slows it down, and then the large warhead selects six levels and manipulates the valve. Overall, we are very confident that we have identified the target. It's Natanz, and it can only be Natanz. We are not worried about other possible targets that the Stuxnet virus might attack. Some of the things we've seen are really cool--things that really surprised me. Here below is a gray box, and what you see above it is the centrifuge. he thing is, it intercepts input values sent from sensors, such as pressure and vibration sensors, and provides legitimate code that will continue to run during the attack, along with fake input data. In fact, this fake input data was pre-stored by the Stuxnet virus. It's like a heist scene in a Hollywood movie, where a camera is shown displaying pre-recorded footage. Pretty cool, isn't it? Its intention is clearly not just to fool operators in the control room. It's actually more dangerous and aggressive. Its intention is to bypass digital security systems. We need digital security systems where human operators cannot act quickly enough. For example, in a power plant, when a huge steam turbine is spinning too fast, a safety valve must be opened in one millisecond. Obviously, human operators cannot do this. Therefore, digital security systems are needed here. And when they are compromised, the real problem arises. The power plant will explode. Neither the operator nor the safety system will notice. This is scary. But it will get worse. What I'm about to say is very important. Think about it. This type of attack is universal. It doesn't require anything specific to centrifuges or uranium enrichment. It will also work, for example, in a power plant or a car factory. This is very common. As an attacker, you don't need to spread the virus with a USB drive, as we saw in the case of Stuxnet. You can also use traditional worm techniques to spread it as widely as possible. If you do this, you will eventually have a massive network weapon of mass destruction. These are the consequences we have to face. Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for these attacks are not in the Middle East. They are in the United States, Europe, and Japan. All these green areas are target-rich areas. We have to face these consequences, and we'd better start preparing immediately. Thank you. Chris Anderson: I have a question. Ralph, it's widely believed that Mossad is behind this. What do you think? Ralph Langner: Well, you really want to know? Yes, well, I believe Mossad is involved, but the leading force is not Israel. The leading force behind it is a cyber superpower. There's only one, and that is the United States - very fortunately, very fortunately. Because otherwise, the problem we're facing would be even more severe. Chris: Thank you, Ralph, you scared us there for a moment. Thank you.
I want everyone to imagine a wearable robot that can provide you with superhuman abilities or allow wheelchair users to stand up and walk again. We call these robots exoskeletons at the Berkeley Bionics company. There is nothing else like it. When you put it on in the morning, it will provide you with extra strength, it will increase your speed, it will help you, for example, control your balance. In fact, it truly integrates humans and machines. But not only that, it will also integrate and connect you to the outside world, connecting to other devices. This is not just some wild imagination. To show you what we are currently working on, let's talk about American soldiers who can carry about 100 pounds on their backs and are being asked to carry more equipment. Obviously, this leads to some concurrent problems -- 30% of soldiers have back injuries -- chronic back injuries. So we think we should face this challenge and create an exoskeleton that can help solve this problem. So now let me introduce you to the HULC -- the human load-bearing exoskeleton. Soldier: After using the HULC exoskeleton, I can carry up to 200 pounds and walk for hours in complex terrain. Its flexible design allows for squatting, crawling, and highly mobile movements. It can sense what I want to do, where I want to go, and then enhance my strength and endurance.Ether Edge: We and our industry partners are ready to introduce this new exoskeleton this year. This is real. Now let's turn our attention to wheelchair users, which is a part that I personally love very much. There are an estimated 68 million wheelchair users in the world, about 1% of the total population. This is a conservative estimate. What we're talking about now is that young people with spinal cord injuries hit a wall in their prime years—20s, 30s, 40s—and the wheelchair becomes the only option. Moreover, the aging of the population is causing this number to multiply. And this only option, roughly - when people have a stroke or other illnesses - is a wheelchair. In fact, it's been a very successful introduction for the last 500 years, I must say. Therefore, I think it's time for us to start writing a new chapter in mobility. Now let me introduce you to eLEGS, which is worn by Amanda Boxtel. She suffered a spinal cord injury 19 years ago, which left her unable to walk for 19 years until now. Amanda Boxtel: Thank you. Ether: As I said, Amanda is wearing our eLEGS. It has sensors - completely non-invasive sensors within these supports - that send signals to the onboard computer mounted on her back. There is also a battery pack that provides power to the electric motors located in her hips, including the electric motor at her knee, which allows her to walk with smooth, natural steps. Amanda: At the peak of my life at the age of 24, I fell while speed skiing, and I became paralyzed. In that moment, I lost all sensation and mobility below my pelvis. Soon after, a doctor walked into my hospital room and told me, "Amanda, you will never walk again." That was 19 years ago. He took away every bit of hope I had. Adaptive technology allowed me to learn how to speed ski again, climb mountains, and even ride a hand cycle. But there was no invention that could make me walk, until now. Thank you. Ether: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platform to sit on, which has already been discussed with everyone. It's in our hands, and we have all the potential to change the lives of our offspring -- not just for soldiers, or for Amanda and all wheelchair users, but for everyone. Amanda: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that holds the secret of human survival. In this community, women are in charge of everything, announcing when they want to have sex, and play is the order of the day - playing joyfully is a serious and solemn matter. No, this is not about burning desires in men, nor is it about San Francisco. Ladies and gentlemen, meet your close relatives. This is the world of wild bonobos, located in the jungles of Congo. Bonobos and chimpanzees are our closest living relatives. This means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolved grandmother who lived about 6 million years ago. Now, chimpanzees are known for their aggression. Unfortunately, we have overemphasized this aspect in the history of human evolution. However, what bonobos show us is the other side of the coin. When chimpanzees are led by big and intimidating male chimpanzees, bonobo communities are led by female bonobos. These bonobos can live together peacefully, forming a highly inclusive society. In this community, fatal violent behavior has not been observed. Unfortunately, bonobos are one of the most difficult to understand among apes. They live deep in the jungles of Congo, so studying them is very difficult. Congo is a contradictory body- it is a land that nurtures extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but it is also a dark heart- scenes of violent conflict have been going on for decades, taking many lives just like World War I. Not surprisingly, this destruction also threatens the survival of bonobos. The trade of hunting for meat and deforestation means that we cannot provide a small habitat for the only remaining bonobos in the world - in fact, we cannot even be sure if there is a small habitat. However, in this land full of violence and chaos, you can hear faint laughter swaying in the trees. What kind of animal are these close relatives? We know they are "make love, not war" apes, so they have frequent and casual sexual activity, and bisexual intercourse to handle conflicts and solve social problems. I am not saying that this is the solution to all human problems - because for bonobos, play means much more than just pleasure. Bonobos, like humans, love to play throughout their lives. Play is not just child's play. For us humans and bonobos, play is the foundation for building close relationships and cultivating tolerance. It also teaches us trust and the rules of the game, enhances creativity and adaptability, and is all about generating diversity - the interaction of diversity, diverse behaviors, and diverse connections. When you see bonobos play, you can see the evolutionary roots of human laughter, dance, and ritual. Play is the glue that binds us together. Now, I don't know how you like to play, but I want to show you two special clips just filmed in the wild. First, this is a bonobo-style ball game - and I'm not talking about football. Here, a young male and female bonobo are playing a chasing game. Look at what she's doing. This might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase "she's playing with his balls." I can only imagine he really likes it that way, right? Yes. So, sexual play is commonplace in both bonobos and humans. This video is really interesting because it proves how creativity can arise from introducing unusual elements into a game - such as testicles - and how games can seek and cultivate trust while being fun. But play is a transformative process. Play can transform into many playful games, some of which are quiet, imaginative, exploratory - perhaps the wonder of play is discovering new things. I want everyone to see this, this is Fuku, a young female bonobo, and she's quietly playing with water. I think that, like her, we sometimes play alone, exploring the boundaries between our inner selves and the external world. It is the novelty of play that drives us to explore and to interact. The unexpected connections we form are the true incubator of creativity. So these are just a taste of the profound insights brought to us by bonobos to explore our past and present. But they also hold a secret to our future, as we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through unprecedented creativity and more collaboration. This secret is that play is the key to possessing these abilities. In other words, play is the universal card for our future adaptation. To successfully adapt to a changing world, we need play. But should we play as much as possible? Play is not trivial; play is essential. Like chimpanzees and humans, life is not just about blood-red teeth and sharp claws. It is often when it seems least appropriate to play that play is most urgently needed. So, my primate siblings, let us embrace this gift of evolutionary heritage and play together, rediscovering creativity, camaraderie, and wonder. Thank you.
In New York, I am the Director of Development for a non-profit organization called "Robin Hood". In addition to fighting poverty, I also fight fires. I am the Deputy Commander of the volunteer fire department in our small town, where every volunteer is a successful person. You have to get to the scene very early to have a chance to join the battle. I remember my first fire; I was the second volunteer to arrive at the scene. I could have possibly entered the fire, but I had to outrun other volunteers to find the Chief and get him to assign me a job. When I finally found the Chief, he was completely absorbed in discussing with the homeowner, who was obviously having the worst day of her life. It was the middle of the night, and she was standing in pouring rain in her pajamas, barefoot, holding an umbrella. Her house was burning fiercely. Another volunteer who arrived before me, let's call him Lex Luther, had already reached the Chief and was assigned to go into the fire to save the homeowner's little dog. A dog! I was so jealous. The lawyer or financial manager can tell others for a lifetime that he or she entered the fire and saved a living dog, just because he or she arrived five seconds earlier than me. Okay, it's my turn now. The chief called me over and said, "Bezos, I need you to rush into the fire. I need you to go upstairs, past the flames, and get a pair of shoes for this lady." It's true, I swear. This wasn't the image in my mind, but I went. I went upstairs, walked to the end of the corridor, and passed by the "real" firefighters who had almost extinguished the fire. I walked into the master bedroom and got a pair of shoes. I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero. I took my task downstairs and met the man who arrived five seconds earlier than me, along with the dog he rescued. We walked towards the front door with our treasures. As expected, he received more attention than me. A few weeks later, our department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for our heroic actions in saving her home. She specifically mentioned a heartwarming detail that someone even brought her a pair of shoes. Whether it's my work at Robin Hood or my side gig as a volunteer firefighter, I've witnessed many acts of kindness and generosity. I've also seen firsthand how one person's courage and compassion can make a tremendous difference. You know what I've learned? They're all equally important. As I look around at all of you successful or soon-to-be successful people, you all have achievements that are worthy of admiration. And I want to remind you: don't wait. Don't wait until you've earned your first million to start making a difference in someone's life. If you have something to give, start giving now. Whether it's providing food for the poor or setting an example for others, Not every day we have the chance to save someone's life, but every day we have the opportunity to impact someone's life. So come on, let's save that pair of shoes. Thank you, Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back. Thank you all.
It may sound a bit strange, but I am a fanatic of cement bricks. The first cement brick was produced in 1868, originating from a very simple idea: to assemble fixed-sized blocks made of cement together. Soon, cement bricks became the most widely used building unit in the world, allowing us to make things far larger than ourselves, buildings, bridges, and so on, built brick by brick. Cement bricks have essentially become the building blocks of our time. In about 100 years, in 1947, LEGO brought us what was then called the automatic binding bricks. And in just a few short years, LEGO bricks have conquered every home, with an estimated production of over 400 billion LEGO bricks - or 75 LEGO bricks per person worldwide. You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful houses, bridges, or buildings. LEGO made it possible. Essentially, LEGO is taking the concrete brick, this real-world building block, and applying it to the building blocks of our imaginations.Coincidentally, that same year, a new revolution was about to be announced at Bell Labs—the next generation of building blocks. The transistor was a small plastic component that would take us from a world of static brick stacking to a world where everything could be interactive. Like concrete bricks, you could use it to build larger, more complex circuits, one transistor at a time. But there was a major difference: only experts could play with transistors.I personally couldn't accept that the building blocks of our era were something that only experts could play with, so I decided to change it. Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started thinking about how to give artists and designers the same power that engineers had. A few years ago, I started developing littleBits. Let me show you how it works. LittleBits are electronic modules, each with a specific function. They are all preset as light, sound, motor, or sensor. The best part is that they are magnetically connected, so it's impossible to assemble them incorrectly. These small blocks are color-coded. Green is output, blue is power, pink is input, and orange is a connector. So all you have to do is connect the blue to the green, and soon you can start making larger circuits. Connect blue to green and you've made a light. You can add a knob in the middle and create a small dimmer. Remove the knob and replace it with a pulse module, and here, you have created a small signal light. Add this buzzer for some extra effects, and you've created a noise machine. I have to stop here. In addition to simple play, littleBits' functionality is actually powerful. You don't need to program, wire, or solder. LittleBits allows you to program with simple intuitive actions. For example, to speed up or slow down this flicker, you just need to turn this knob, which actually pulses faster or slower. The idea behind LittleBits is that it is a growing database. We want to make every individual interactive function in the world into a readily available building block. Light, sound, solar panels, motors - everything should be at your fingertips. We once gave LittleBits to children and watched them play. It was an incredible experience. The best thing is that they start to understand how the electrical appliances around them work, which they can't learn in schools. For example, how does a night light work, or why can an elevator door stay open, or how does an iPod respond to touch. We have also brought littleBits to design schools. For example, we once let designers who had no electronic experience use littleBits as materials to start playing. As you can see, using felt and paper cups, Jodi made... A few weeks ago, we took littleBits to the Rhode Island School of Design and gave it to some designers who had no engineering experience, just some cardboard, wood, and paper, and told them to "do something." This is the project they completed - an action-triggered confetti cannon. And this is actually my favorite project. It's a lobster made of clay, and it's afraid of the dark. For these non-engineering professionals, littleBits became another material, and electronics became just a material. Moreover, we want to make this material available to everyone. So LittleBits is open source. You can go to our website and download all the design files and make them yourself. We want to encourage a world where everyone is a creator, inventor, and contributor. Because the world we live in, this interactive world, belongs to each and every one of us. So don't hesitate, start inventing. Thank you, everyone.
Today, I want to talk about some unexpected discoveries. I work in the solar energy industry now, and my small company has just been founded. We are seeking ways to integrate with nature, which can be achieved through focusing on... focusing on crowdsourcing. This short video showcases the work we have done. Oh, wait a second, it takes some time to load the video. Maybe we can skip it-- I will skip the video... Oh no, don't do that, this is... Okay. Solar energy technology is... Wait, my time is up? Well, thank you very much.
A few years ago, I launched a project that allowed some talented tech and design people to work within an environment that should represent everything they hate - government agencies. The project was called "Code for America," kind of like the Justice League. We select a few people each year and then have them work for the government. Not the third world, but the city hall. There, they create great applications and work alongside municipal employees. But their real purpose is to demonstrate the possibilities of what technology can create today. This is Al. Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Burlington. Here it may look like it's waiting for its date, but what it's really waiting for is someone who can dig it out when it's buried deep in the snow because it knows that its ability to fight fires diminishes when it's buried in four feet of snow. How did it seek help in such a unique way? Last year, we had a team working in Burlington for "Code for America." They were there in February, which happened to be a heavy snow month. They noticed that the fire hydrants in the city were rarely shoveled out. One of the team members, Erik Michaels-Ober, noticed another phenomenon: citizens would shovel out the snow on the sidewalks in front of these fire hydrants. So he did what any good programmer would do: he wrote an app. It's a cute little app that lets you adopt a fire hydrant. You agree to shovel it out after it snows. If you do so, you can name it; he named the first one Al. But if you don't shovel it out, someone else can steal it from you. So it has some little gaming aspects to it. This is a relatively small program, perhaps the smallest of the 21 programs written by that team that year. But it did something that no other government technology could do; it spread like a virus. Someone who worked in the IT department in Honolulu, Hawaii saw the program and realized that it didn't have to be used to shovel snow, it could also be used to have citizens adopt tsunami warning sirens. These tsunami warning sirens are important, but often people steal the batteries inside them. So he had citizens voluntarily check them. Then Seattle decided to use it to have citizens clear blocked storm drains after heavy rain. Chicago only began using it to have people shovel snow off sidewalks. We now know of nine other cities that plan to use it. It spread smoothly, naturally, and organically like this. If you have some knowledge about government technology, you would know this is not a common outcome. Developing a software often takes several years. Last year, a team of three in Burlington spent two and a half months to complete a project that helps parents determine which public school is best for their children. Afterwards, we were told that if this project went through normal channels, it would take at least two years and cost nearly two million dollars. And that's just a small figure. California's court system has a project that has cost taxpayers two billion dollars to date, and it still cannot operate normally. And at every level of government, there are similar projects. So, a program that only takes a few days to program and spreads like a virus is a warning to government agencies. It witnessed that the government could become more efficient - but not more like a private company, as many people think. It is not even like a tech company, but more like the network itself. This means no approval, openness, and productivity. And this is very important. But what this program represents, even more importantly, is that a new generation of people is looking for ways to solve government problems as a collective action, rather than as a rigid institution. And this is good news because the fact is that we are very good at operating as a digital technology group. There is now a very large group building tools that can make us more efficient. It's not just "Code for America" employees, there are hundreds of people across the country writing programs in their own communities every day and applying them to their own communities. They have not given up on the government. Although they are very disappointed about it, they do not complain, but try to improve it. These people know something we've lost, that when you strip away everything that makes us angry, such as our feelings about politics and the lines outside the DMV, government, at its core, as Tim O'Reilly puts it, "can help us achieve things that we can't do as individuals." Many people have given up on the government completely. If you're one of them, I hope you'll reconsider because a lot of things are changing. Politics hasn't changed, but government is changing. And because the power of government comes fundamentally from us, the people, how we view it will affect how it changes. When I started this project, I didn't know much about the government. Like many people, I thought the government was just elected officials working in departments. Two years later, I came to a conclusion. The government, especially local government, is about the nut and bolts. Here is the hotline center for services and information. If you dial 311 in your city, you'll be connected to this place. If you have the opportunity to work at your city's hotline center, like our colleague Scott Silverman did for this project--in fact, they all need to do this service--you'll find that people call the government for very different reasons, including being trapped by a negative rat in their home. Scott received this call. He entered "negative rat" into the official information database. There was nothing. He started with the animal control center. In the end, he said, "Why don't you open all your doors, play loud music, and see if the thing will leave?" And it worked. Scott, well done. But that's not the end of the negative rat story. Boston doesn't have a hotline center. It has a program, a website, and a mobile app called "Citizen Connect." We didn't write this program. It was created by a group of smart people in the New Urban Mechanics department in Boston. One day - this is a true story - this message was posted: "There's a rat in my trash can. Can't tell if it's dead. How do I get rid of it?" "Citizens Connect" handles these types of issues differently. Scott's previous work involved person-to-person communication. But with "Citizens Connect," everything is public, so anyone can see it. This time, a neighbor saw it. The next report we received said: "I walked by the location and found the trash can behind the house. Rat? Seen it. Definitely alive." Tipped the can over and walked home. Goodnight, little rat." It's that simple. So this is good. This is a good example of the intersection of the real world and the digital world. It is also a good example of the government joining the crowdsourcing game. But it is also a good example of the government being a communication platform. Here I am not talking about the technical definition of the platform. I just want to mention a platform that allows people to help each other. One citizen helps another citizen, and the government plays an important role in connecting the two." It can help people in need through government facilities and services, but a neighbor is much simpler and more effective than government services. When a neighbor helps another, our social connections are strengthened. If we call the animal control center, we will only spend a lot of money. One important thing we need to think about is that the government is not the same as politics. Many people understand this, but they still think that politics is the input port of the government. The input port of the government system is through voting. So far, how many political leaders have we elected - and sometimes we spend a lot of energy supporting the election of a new political leader - and then we expect the government to do something that reflects our values and our needs, but in the end, there are not many changes? That's because the government is like a huge ocean, and politics is only the top layer. Below is what we call the bureaucracy. We speak of this word with such disdain. But it is this disdain that keeps us from getting what we have and paying to maintain it, and it always goes against our wishes, and we are losing our own energy because of it. People seem to think politics is sexy. If we want this department to serve us, we must make the bureaucracy sexy too. Because that's where the real work of government happens. We must participate in the government system. And that's what the Occupy SEC movement did. Have you seen these people? They are a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed, 325-page report in response to the SEC's request for financial reform legislation. This is not political participation, but active participation in the bureaucracy. Now, for those of us who have given up on the government, it's time to ask ourselves what kind of world we want to leave for our children. Everyone must realize that they need to face huge challenges. Can we really achieve our goals before we improve the institution that can represent our actions? We cannot be without government, we need it to become more efficient. The good news is that technology is making this feasible by fundamentally redefining the function of government, and through it we can strengthen our civil society. The current generation is growing up in the network, and they know that it is not difficult to do two things at the same time, just need to build the system well. Our staff's average age is 28 years old, so I am almost older than most of them by one generation. This generation is accustomed to advocating for themselves as they grow up. They no longer need to go through the battle of who can have freedom of speech in our generation; they all have freedom of speech. They can express their opinions through any channel at any time, and they do so. So when they face the flaws of the government, they don't care much about advocating with their right to speak. They will use their hands. They are using their hands to write programs that can make the government work better. And these programs allow us to improve our society with our own hands. It can be digging fire hydrants out of the snow, pulling weeds, or tipping over garbage cans with rodents. Of course, many people have already begun to dig fire hydrants out of the snow. But these programs are like small digital alarms that remind us that we are not just consumers. We are not just consumers of the government, paying taxes in exchange for services. We are not just that; we are citizens. Before we improve the government, we must take responsibility as citizens. So here I leave you with a question: when we face something big, important, and requiring us to work together, will we be just a group of people with the right to speak, or will we also be a group of people working together to get things done? Thank you.
I'm honored to be here. Most of the time, I am in correctional facilities, in prisons, in death row. Most of the time, I work in low-income communities, doing projects that have no future in hopeless areas. Today, coming to TED and seeing and hearing these inspiring speeches, it gives me a shot in the arm. In this short time, I notice that TED has its own positioning. You can see what happens here that affects the whole world. Sometimes, when things happen on the TED stage, it's more meaningful and impactful than if it happened elsewhere. I bring this up because I think self-positioning is important. We've heard some wonderful speeches, and we understand that as a teacher, your words carry weight. If you're a compassionate teacher, your teachings carry extra meaning. As a doctor, you can help people. If you are a doctor who cares for patients, you can help even more. So, I want to talk about the importance of positioning. I did not learn how to self-position from being a lawyer or from doing other projects. I actually learned it from my grandmother. My family is a traditional black family with only one female head, my grandmother. She was tough and strong, with an imposing presence. She had decision-making power in our household, but she also initiated a lot of things. Her parents were actual black slaves in Virginia in the 1840s. My grandmother was born in the 1880s, and the experience of her parents' enslavement determined her perspective on the world. My grandmother is forceful, but she is also kind. When I was a little boy, she hugged me every time she saw me. She held me so tightly that I couldn't breathe, and then she would let go. One or two hours later, when I saw her again, she would come up to me and ask, "Can you still feel my hug?" If I said, "I can't feel it," she would attack me again until I said, "I can feel it," and then she let me go. She has this ability to make you always want to be close to her. The only challenge is that she has ten children, and my mother is the youngest among them. It is often challenging to get her attention and have her spend time with me when I want to get close to her. My cousins were always around. I remember one time when I was eight or nine years old. I woke up in the morning and ran to the living room. All my cousins were there, and my grandmother was sitting at the other end of the room, staring at me. At first, I thought we were playing a game, so I smiled back at her. But my grandmother was very serious. About 15 or 20 minutes later, she stood up, crossed the room, took my hand, and said, "Come on, Brian, let's talk." It's like it happened yesterday. I will never forget it. She took me aside and said, "I want to talk to you about something. You can't tell anyone." I promised her, "Okay, grandma." She said, "Promise me you will never tell anyone." I replied, "I promise." Then we sat down and she looked at me and said, "I've been watching you for a while." Then she said, "You're a special child." She said, "I'm sure you can do anything." I will never forget this. Then she said, "I want you to promise me three things." I said, "Okay, grandma." She said, "First, I want you to promise me that you will always love your mother." She said, "Your mother is my heart, and you have to promise me that you will always take care of her." I love my mother very much, so I said, "Okay, grandma, I will." She continued, "The second thing is that I want you to promise me that you will always walk the right path, even when it's a difficult choice." I thought for a moment and replied, "Okay, Grandma, I will." Finally, she said, "The third thing is that I want you to promise me that you will never drink alcohol." I was only nine years old, and I promised, "Okay, Grandma, I promise." I grew up in the countryside in the South with an older brother and a younger sister. When I was around fourteen or fifteen years old, my brother brought home half a dozen beers one day - I didn't even know where he got them - and he took my sister and me to the woods to play and run around like crazy. He took a sip of beer, gave it to my sister, and she drank it. Then they offered it to me, but I said, "No thanks. You guys drink. I won't." My brother said, "Come on, let's all drink today. You're always on our side." He took a sip of beer, then handed it to my sister, and she drank some. Then they handed it to me. I said, "No, I don't want any. You guys drink. I'm not drinking." My brother stared at me and asked, "What's wrong with you? Just have a little." Then he scrutinized me for a while and asked, "Oh, are you still thinking about the promises grandma asked you to make?" I said, "What are you talking about?" He said, "Grandma tells every grandchild that they're special." It made me sad. Now I want to confess something to everyone, but maybe I shouldn't say it here. Even though this speech will be broadcasted everywhere. I am fifty-two years old this year, and I have to admit that I have never had a drop of alcohol. I'm not saying this to show how moral I am; I'm saying this to demonstrate the power of self-identity. When we have the right self-identity, we can make the world accept things that they couldn't have imagined before. We can do things that they thought were impossible. When I think of my grandmother, she naturally thought that each of her grandchildren was special. My grandfather went to jail for breaking the law, and more than one of my uncles died from alcohol-related illnesses. These were principles that my grandmother believed we should adhere to. What I want to introduce to everyone is our criminal justice system. Compared to forty years ago, this country has changed a lot. In 1972, there were only 300,000 people in prison. Today, there are 2.3 million. The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. We have seven million people on probation and parole. In my view, this massive sentencing has completely changed our world. In poor communities and communities of color, there is despair. This despair is caused by these changes. One-third of black men between the ages of 18 and 30 are either in prison, on probation, or on parole. In cities across the country - Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington - 50 to 60 percent of young people of color are either in prison, on probation, or on parole. Our justice system has not only changed but also distorted around race and poverty. The justice system in this country will treat you differently if you are a guilty rich person rather than an innocent poor person. The wealth, not the fault itself, determines the ultimate outcome. However, we are quite comfortable. Politicians who manipulate fear and anger have convinced us that it's none of our business and we should ignore it. I'm very interested in this. In our daily work, we can see some interesting changes. In Alabama, where I live, like many other states, if you're convicted of a crime, you lose your right to vote for life. Now in Alabama, 34% of black men have permanently lost their voting rights. Looking ahead ten years, the percentage of disenfranchisement will be as high as it was before the Voting Rights Act was passed, but no one is talking about it. I represent children in court. Many of my clients are very young. The United States is the only country in the world that can sentence a thirteen-year-old child to life imprisonment without parole. Our country imposes life imprisonment without parole on children, and they cannot be released on parole. We are actually helping these people appeal their cases now, which is unique in the world. I also handle cases for death row inmates. The issue of the death penalty is thought-provoking. We learn from various sources that the fundamental question is whether people should pay with their lives for the crimes they have committed. This is a very reasonable question. But on the other hand, the problem is our self-positioning. Another way of thinking about the problem is not whether people should pay for their crimes with their lives, but whether we deserve to kill them. I mean, this issue is very shocking. The death penalty is often mistaken in the United States. For every nine people sentenced to death, one will later be proven innocent and spared from execution. This error rate - one in nine people is completely innocent - I have to say, is very shocking. People who study aviation know that if one in every nine planes crashes, we definitely wouldn't let people fly on it. But inexplicably, we can ignore the problem of the death penalty because it's not our own problem. On the one hand, it's not our own trouble, it's not our own struggle. I have talked about many issues, such as race, and whether we deserve to execute the death penalty. It's very thought-provoking. When I teach African American history, I talk to my students about slavery and I talk to them about terrorism - the era that began in the late Reconstruction period and continued until World War II. We don't really understand that history, but for black people in this country, it was a white terror era. In many communities, people were afraid of being lynched at any moment, and they were afraid of being attacked by bombs at any time. That white terror era changed their lives. The people from that time are now older and they come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you're out there talking all the time. You need to tell people that it's not 9/11 that is the first time this country has had to deal with terrorism." They say to me, "We grew up with terrorism." That era of terrorism, of course, ultimately became an unbridgeable chasm. Decades of racial discrimination and segregation. However, our country does not like to discuss existing problems. We do not like to discuss history. As a result, we cannot truly understand what we have done in our history. We continue to generate conflict, and to create tension. We cannot discuss the issue of race. I believe it is because we are unwilling to face a series of facts, unwilling to achieve reconciliation. In South Africa, people know that we cannot forget apartheid unless we face it honestly and reach reconciliation. Even in Rwanda, people still face it honestly even after genocide. But in the United States, we are not willing to do so. I also talked about the death penalty in Germany. The result was amazing because after the talk, a scholar stood up and said, "You know, it's painful to hear you talk about this." She said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany. Of course, we will never have the death penalty in Germany." The whole audience was silent. The woman said, "Because of our history, we can never decide to systematically kill people. To carry out the death penalty openly and subconsciously is morally unacceptable to us. I thought about this issue. If I watched Germans killing people all day and senselessly slaughtering Jews, how would I feel?" I cannot bear it. That is too unreasonable. However, in our country, in various southern states, we are really slaughtering - when the chances of being sentenced to death increase tenfold just because the victim is white, not black, and when the chances of being sentenced to death increase twenty-one times just because the defendant is black, not white - in these states, there are buried people who were lynched everywhere. However, we still don't care. I believe this shows that we have a crisis of orientation. When we ignore these thorny issues, we still care about the positive things as usual. We love innovation, technology, creation, and entertainment. But in the end, these good realities are plagued by pain, abuse of power, deprivation of human rights, marginalization, and shadow. For me, the integration of the two is necessary because ultimately what we are talking about is how to deal with the various challenges of living in this complex society with more hope, security, and contribution. For me, this requires time for thought and discussion about the poor, marginalized groups, and those who never have a chance to come to TED. But we think that in some sense they are integrated into our lives. We must know that in the end, we must believe in things that we have not seen with our own eyes. We have to. As a rational and intelligent society, innovation, creation, and development are not just empty ideas in our minds. They are products of the combination of wisdom in our minds and beliefs in our hearts. I believe that this integration of intelligence and wisdom will drive us to not only focus on bright things, but also on dark and tricky things. Václav Havel, the outstanding leader of the Czech Republic, has talked about this issue. He said, "When we try to solve the problem of forced oppression in Eastern Europe, we hope to accomplish a lot. But most importantly, we need hope, a spiritual orientation, an attitude that does not shy away from experiencing despair, and a willingness to leave a historical record." This spiritual orientation is my core belief, and our TED society should also participate. There should be nothing that separates high-tech and perfect design from our humanity. As long as we can still pay attention to pain, poverty, constraints, injustice, and grievances, I want to remind everyone that this positioning is very challenging. It will affect you. When I was a young lawyer, I had the privilege of meeting Mrs. Parks. Mrs. Parks used to come to Montgomery from time to time, and each time she would meet with two friends, older women. There was Mrs. Jeanne Carle, a very excellent black woman who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott, and Virginia Durr, a white woman whose husband, Clifford Durr, was Martin Luther King's lawyer. These ladies often gathered together to discuss issues. Sometimes Mrs. Carle would call me and ask, "Mrs. Parks is back. Would you like to come and listen to us talk?" She would ask, "What are you doing here?" and I would say, "I just want to listen." And then I would go and just listen. These gatherings were always very exciting and inspiring. One time I was there listening to their conversation and a few hours later Mrs. Parks asked me. She said, "Bryan, tell me about your equal justice initiative. Tell me what you plan to do." And I started talking and talking. I said, "We want to challenge unfair treatment. We want to help people who have been wrongly convicted." We want to fight bias and discrimination in the criminal justice system. We want to end the sentence of life imprisonment without parole for children. We want to make changes to the death penalty system. We want to reduce the prison population. We also want to put an end to the excessive use of incarceration." I gave a full and unedited speech, and when I finished, she stared at me and said, "No, no, no." She said, "These will make you tired, tired, and tired." Then Mrs. Carlin leaned over and placed her hand next to my face and said, "That's why you have to be very brave, very brave, very brave." I am convinced that our TED community needs to be more courageous. We need to find a way to face these challenges, these problems, and these pains. Because in the end, our collective humanity depends on each individual's humanity. In my work, I have learned some very simple principles. I have come to understand and believe that none of us is defined by our worst act. I believe that if someone tells a lie, it doesn't make them a liar. If someone takes something that doesn't belong to them, it doesn't make them a thief. Even if you kill someone, it doesn't make you a cold-blooded killer. Because I believe in the basic dignity of human beings, the law must respect that. And I also believe that in many places in our country, and certainly in many places in this world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth. I don't believe in this. I think that, in many places, the opposite of poverty is justice. Ultimately, I believe that even though technology is very loud and exciting, and it stimulates us, we will not be judged by technology itself, nor will we be measured by design. We will not be scored by wisdom and philosophy either. Ultimately, people will judge our society not based on how we treat the rich and privileged, but based on how we treat the poor, the condemned, and the imprisoned. It is at this convergence point that we truly begin to understand what kind of people we are. I often lose my balance. I'd like to end my speech with a story. Sometimes, I work too hard and get tired, just like everyone else. Sometimes, there are too many thoughts, and I can't keep up with them. The result is very serious. I once defended these children who were sentenced to heavy punishment. I went to a correctional facility and saw that all of my defendants were 13 or 14 years old. They were treated as adults. I started to wonder, what's going on? How can a judge declare someone a different person? The judge said he was an adult, but I only saw a child. One night I couldn't sleep, I kept thinking, oh my god, if a judge can make you into someone else, that judge must have magic. Brian, that judge has magic. You better learn something. Because I slept too late and my mind was fuzzy, I started working on a proposal. I had a defendant, a 14-year-old black kid. I started to defend him, with the headline: "Proposal: My 14-Year-Old Poor Black Child to be Seen as a 75-Year-Old Executive of a White Corporation." In this proposal, I said that the prosecutor's office, police station, and court all mishandled the case and that the court had no sense of justice. It was all deliberately judged wrongly. The next morning, I woke up and thought, did I dream that or did I really write that proposal? Terrifyingly, not only did I really write it, I also sent it to the court. A few months passed and I forgot about it. Finally, I decided, oh my god, I have to go to court to argue this case. I got into the car and felt nervous, very nervous. I drove to the court and thought that it would be a tough battle, very painful. Finally, I got out of the car and started walking towards the court. As I climbed the stairs, an elderly black janitor, a court cleaner, saw me and ran up to me and asked, "Who are you?" I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You, a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir." This old man leaned over and gave me a hug. He whispered in my ear, "I'm so proud of you."I have to admit that this gave me a shot of adrenaline. His words reminded me of my self-positioning and reminded me that everyone should contribute to society and a better future. So I ran into the courtroom, and as soon as the judge saw me, he said: "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy proposal?" I said, "Yes, sir, I did." We began to argue. People started to pour into the room because they were angry. I had written some pretty strong things. The police came in. The assistant prosecutor came in. The clerk came in. Before I knew it, the entire courtroom was filled with people who were furious because we were talking about issues of race, poverty, and inequality. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the janitor outside walking back and forth, looking in. He could hear the complaints of the people. Finally, the old black man came in. He sat down behind me with a worried look on his face and almost touched the defense table. Ten minutes later, the judge proposed a break. During the break, a deputy sheriff felt that the janitor coming into the courtroom was disrespectful. The deputy sheriff jumped up and ran over to the old man, saying, "Jimmy, what are you doing here in the courtroom?" The old black man stood up, looked at the deputy sheriff, looked at me, and said, "I came in here to tell this young man to keep his eyes on the prize, hold on." I'm here today at TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long but it bends towards justice. We cannot truly evolve until we care for human rights and dignity. Our survival and the survival of everyone is intertwined. Our technological and design prospects, our vision for entertainment and creativity must be combined with humaneness, charity, and a commitment to justice. Most importantly, for every person who is fixated on something, I just want to say, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on. Thank you, everyone. Chris Anderson: You should hear and see the willingness of these audiences and this group to help you and make contributions. Besides writing a check, what else can we do? Bryan: There are many opportunities. For example, if you live in California, there will be a big effort this spring about reallocating the money we spend on punishing people. For instance, in California, we will spend $100 million over the next five years, and 46% of homicide cases have no resolution, and 56% of rape cases cannot be solved. This initiative is an opportunity to change the status quo and propose to spend this money on law enforcement and security. I think we can help with this opportunity.Chris Anderson: In the past 30 years, the crime rate in the United States has significantly decreased. Some people say that it's partially due to the significant increase in the incarceration rate. What do you say to those who hold this view?Bryan Stevenson: Actually, the crime rate hasn't really changed. The significant increase in the incarceration rate in this country is not due to violent crime, but rather to the abuse of drugs, which is the main reason for the increase in our prison population. We have gone too far with fancy forms of punishment, and we have the three-strikes rule that can permanently imprison some people just because they stole a bike or a small amount of property. We don't give them the opportunity to make restitution to the victims. I believe we need to give more help to people who commit crimes instead of taking away what little they have. I think today's philosophy of criminal law doesn't benefit anyone. I think this general direction needs to change. Chris: Brian, you really shook everyone up today. You're a very inspiring guy. Thank you very much for coming to TED. Thank you.

Peter Diamandis: These are some of the videos I've collected over the past six months. Similar clips could easily be collected over six days, or six years for that matter. The key point is that the news media tends to feed us negative information because our brains are particularly prone to paying attention to it. Of course, there is a good reason why our brains do this. Every moment, our "sensors" collect so much information that our brains cannot process it all. And there is nothing more important than information related to survival. The first stop for all information input is a very primitive part of the temporal lobe called the amygdala. The amygdala is our early warning detector and danger sensor. It categorizes and carefully examines all information, detecting any potential threats in the environment. So every time we open a newspaper, we unconsciously read all kinds of negative information. The saying about newspapers in the past, "If it bleeds, it leads," is actually quite reasonable. And now we have various digital devices that constantly feed us negative news. No wonder everyone is so easily pessimistic. No wonder people feel like the world is regressing. But the fact may not be so. The information we receive is distorted. Under the influence of a series of events in the last century, the huge progress that our society has made is constantly accelerating. In fact, such speed gives us the possibility to create a prosperous world in the next thirty years. I am not saying that these problems do not exist - the climate crisis, species extinction, and shortages of water resources and energy have indeed occurred. As humans, we are too good at making various predictions about crises, but we will eventually eliminate them. Let us review what happened in the last century to understand what direction we are moving towards. Over the past few hundred years, the average life expectancy of humans has more than doubled, and the per capita income of the world has increased by three times after adjusting for inflation. The infant mortality rate has dropped by ten times. The cost of food, electricity, transportation, and communication has decreased by ten to a thousand times. Steven Pinker pointed out that we are living in the most peaceful era in human history. Charles Kenny also mentioned that the global literacy rate has risen from 25% to 80% in the past 130 years. We do live in a great era. However, many people forget this. We keep setting higher and higher expectations. In fact, we have changed the meaning of "poverty." Think about it, in today's United States, most people living below the poverty line still have electricity, drinking water, toilets, refrigerators, televisions, cell phones, air conditioning, and cars. The richest robbers of the last century, the emperors of this planet, could never imagine such a luxurious life. And all of this is based on technology. And modern, exponential growth technology. My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any information technology tool follows this curve, namely Moore's Law, and undergoes a doubling of cost-effectiveness every 12 to 24 months. That's why your mobile phone in your pocket is 1 million times cheaper and 1000 times faster than the supercomputers of the 1970s. Let's take a look at this curve. This is Moore's Law over the past few hundred years. I want everyone to notice two things that this curve represents. First, it's incredibly smooth - regardless of whether times are good or bad, whether there's war or peace, economic recession or growth. This is because the result of faster computers is used to make even faster computers. It doesn't slow down because of the enormous challenges we face. Although it shows a logarithmic curve on the left, it's still curved upward. The acceleration of technological progress itself is also getting faster and faster.On this curve of Moore's Law, there is a series of powerful technologies available to everyone. Cloud computing, which my friend at Autodesk calls infinite computing; sensors and networks, robotics; 3D printing, which gives us the ability to deploy personalized production on a global scale; artificial life; new fuels, vaccines, and food; digital medicine; nanomaterials and artificial intelligence. How many people in the audience saw IBM's Watson supercomputer win on Jeopardy? That was truly amazing. I looked at various newspaper headlines and found my favorite. I like this one: "Watson conquers human opponents." Jeopardy is not an easy competition. The key to winning is understanding the subtle nuances of human language. You can imagine the scene where artificial intelligence like this exists in cloud computing and is available to anyone with a mobile phone. Four years ago at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I founded a new university called "Singularity University." We teach students about various technologies, especially how to use these technologies to solve the huge challenges facing humanity. Every year, we require students to create a company, develop a product, or provide a service that can have a positive and practical impact on the lives of one billion people within ten years. Imagine a group of students who can influence the lives of a billion people today. This sounded ridiculous 30 years ago. Today, we can list dozens of companies with such achievements. When I think about creating a prosperous society, it's not about creating luxurious lives for everyone on the planet, but creating lives full of possibilities. It's about turning scarce resources into abundant ones. Scarcity is relative, and technology is a force that liberates resources. Let me give you an example. This is a story about Napoleon III in the mid-1800s. He invited the King of Siam to dinner, shown on the left. All of Napoleon's soldiers used silverware to dine, while Napoleon himself used gold utensils. However, the King of Thailand used aluminum utensils. Aluminum used to be the most expensive metal in the world, even more expensive than gold and platinum. That's why the top of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum. Even though aluminum makes up 8.3% of the Earth's total weight, it does not exist in its pure metallic form. It is always combined with oxygen or silica. But then, electrolytic technology emerged, making aluminum so cheap that we now treat aluminum products as disposable. Let's apply this metaphor to other areas and think about energy scarcity. Ladies and gentlemen, on this planet where we live, we receive energy that is equivalent to more than 5,000 times our average annual energy consumption. Every 88 minutes, 16 terawatts of energy are projected onto the surface of the earth. The problem is not energy scarcity, but accessibility. Now, there is some good news. This year, for the first time ever in India, the cost of solar power generation has decreased to half that of fossil fuel power generation - 8.8 rubles compared to 17 rubles. Last year, the cost of solar power generation decreased by half. Last month, MIT released a research report showing that by 2020, in areas of the United States with ample sunshine, the cost of solar power would drop to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour compared to the national average of 15 cents. If we have sufficient energy, we will also have an abundance of clean water. Let's talk about the water wars. Do you remember? In 1990, when the Voyager spacecraft passed Saturn, Carl Sagan turned it around to face Earth and took a famous photo. What was it called? "Light blue dot." Because we live on a "water planet," 70% of the earth's surface is covered with water, yes, 97.5% is saltwater, 2% is icebergs, and we are fighting for 1.5% of the world's water resources, but we still have hope. A technology is ready to be put into use, not 10 or 20 years from now, but now. It is a nanotechnology. This morning, I had a chat with a great DIY inventor, Dean Kamen. I want to share with you - with his permission - the technology he developed called "Slingshot," which some of you may have heard of. It is a small room-sized refrigerator that can produce a thousand liters of clean drinking water every day from any water source - seawater, polluted water, public toilets. The cost per liter is less than 2 cents. The chairman of Coca-Cola recently instructed the testing of hundreds of "Slingshot" devices in several developing countries. If the test is successful, and I am confident it will be, Coca-Cola will deploy the device in 206 countries worldwide. This is the innovation driven by technology that exists today. We see this in mobile phones. Oh my goodness, by the end of 2013, the mobile phone penetration rate in developing countries will reach 70%. Imagine that. A Maasai warrior in central Kenya has better mobile communication than President Reagan had 25 years ago. If they use a smartphone to access Google, they will get more knowledge and information than President Clinton got 15 years ago. They live in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have predicted in the past. And even better, what we spend thousands of dollars on - GPS, HDTV, graphics and images, and medical diagnostic technology - is dematerialized and non-commercially entered into your mobile phone. Perhaps the best part of this is healthcare. Last month, I was honored to announce the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder XPRIZE with the Qualcomm Foundation. We challenge teams around the world to combine these technologies into mobile devices. You can talk to it because it has artificial intelligence, or cough or prick your finger to check your blood. To win the competition, this device needs to provide better diagnosis than a group of committee-validated physicians. Imagine this device applied in developing countries where there is a shortage of physicians and only 1.3% of medical personnel carry 25% of the disease burden. If this device cannot identify the virus RNA or DNA after sequencing, it will call the disease control center to prevent the outbreak of a large-scale epidemic in the first time.And there is the power that can create a prosperous world. I call it "the rise of the billion." This white line represents the population. The world's population recently exceeded 7 billion. By the way, the best way to prevent explosive population growth is to educate people around the world and become healthier. In 2010, we had nearly 2 billion people connected to the network. By 2020, internet users will increase from 2 billion to 5 billion. 3 billion new users that have not been noticed. They will participate in this global conversation. What do they want? What will they consume? What are their desires? What we will welcome is not a recession, but the biggest injection of economic vitality. These people represent hundreds of trillions of dollars in purchasing power that will flow into the global economy. They will be healthier because of using handheld mobile analyzers, more educated because of watching Khan Academy, and more productive than ever before with 3D printing and infinite computing. What can 3 billion healthy, educated, and productive human society members bring us? A series of new thoughts that we have never encountered before. It also provides the first opportunity for the suppressed or otherwise disadvantaged people to receive attention and assistance. What will these 3 billion people bring? Perhaps it is a contribution that we have not yet been able to foresee? One thing I learned in organizing the X competition is that small teams with clear goals and passion can achieve outstanding results that were previously only achievable by large companies and governments. Let me share a story to conclude, a story that has me very excited. Some of you may have heard of this project before. It's a game called Foldit from the University of Washington in Seattle. It allows individuals to obtain an amino acid sequence and analyze how the protein folds. The folding determines the structure and function of the amino acid, which is critical to medical research. Until now, this has been a problem only solvable by supercomputers. Initially, the game was played by university professors. Then, hundreds and thousands of people went online to play the game. It also demonstrates that to this day, human pattern recognition is still better than the best computers. When everyone ranked the best protein folder experts, it wasn't a professor from MIT or a student from Caltech, but a British woman from Manchester who worked as an administrative assistant at a rehabilitation clinic during the day and was the best protein folding expert in the world at night.Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me great confidence in the future is that we are all empowered as individuals to challenge the world's problems. We have rapidly advancing technology and tools, as well as the passion of DIY inventors. Everyone is capable of becoming a technology-philanthropist. At the same time, 3 billion new users have come online to work with us to solve great challenges and do what we must do. We are about to usher in a period of excellence in the next few decades. Thank you, everyone.
I'm going to talk about a very small concept that relates to changes in benchmarks. This concept can be explained in one minute, so I'll start by telling three stories to fill some time.The first story is about Darwin, one of my idols. He visited here, as you all know, in 1935. You might think he was here to study birds, but actually he was here to fish. He said that one particular fish was "common." It was a grouper that was caught in large numbers until the 1980s. Now, this fish has been listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. We have heard this story many times, in the Galapagos Islands and elsewhere. There is nothing new about it. The problem is, do we still go to the Galapagos Islands and think that it is still in its original state? Tourism brochures still say it is undeveloped. What is the situation there?The second story is about another concept, called the "shifting baseline syndrome." (Laughter) In 1971, I was in West Africa studying a lake. I went there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted to work in Africa. I thought I could blend in with the local society. I also got a sunburned patch. As a result, I discovered that I was indeed not from Africa. That was the first time I got sunburned. This marsh lake is surrounded by palm trees and you can see some mangroves. There are tilapias here, about 20 centimeters long. This type of tilapia is called the black-chinned tilapia. People fish for tilapias, which allows many fish to survive. They are thriving, and fishing income in Ghana is above average. Twenty-seven years later, I returned there and found that the size of these fish had been reduced by half. They only grow up to five centimeters long now, and their development has been genetically altered. There are still fish there, and they are still doing well. The fish also like to live there, and it seems like nothing has changed, but in fact, everything has changed. The third story is about introducing trawl fishing to Southeast Africa. I had a part in this. In the 1970s - actually, the early 1960s - Europe carried out many development projects, including fisheries development, which meant forcing countries with up to 100,000 fishermen to engage in industrial fishing. This ship, the Mutiara 4, was quite ugly. I boarded this ship and we conducted surveys along the South China Sea, especially the Java Sea. We caught things that we couldn't even name. Now I know that what we caught was seabed organisms, 90% of which were sponges and other animals fixed to the seabed. Most of the fish were actually the little dots among the debris. They were the fish living in the coral reefs. The seabed was lifted onto the deck and then thrown back into the sea. These photos were of great significance because the change process was very fast. In less than a year, another survey was conducted, and then the fishing industry started again. The seabed changed. Hard seabed or soft coral turned into a muddy puddle. This is a dead sea turtle. They were not eaten, but were thrown away because they died. Once we caught a live one that had not drowned. They wanted to kill it because sea turtle meat is very delicious. This pile of debris is what the fishermen have brought up. Every time they enter unexplored waters, they can catch these things, but this is not recorded. We have changed the world but do not take responsibility. We adjust the baseline to a new level and forget about the previous level. To summarize, the Y-axis represents good things such as biodiversity, the number of right whales, greening of your country, and water supply that change over time due to human activities or natural changes. Every generation takes the conscious picture at the beginning as the standard and extrapolates forward. The gap they produce is considered a loss, but they do not see what happened before as a loss. A series of changes occurred, and in the end, you hope to protect the last surviving creatures, which is largely what we need to do now. We want to protect what has disappeared or changed. People should now realize that this issue will certainly affect them. They hunt and kill animals, and it takes several generations to realize what they have done. Obviously, before an animal becomes extinct or endangered, there are still many of them, so you will not lose a large number of animal species. What you lose are rare animals, so the disappearance of these animals is not considered a major loss. Over time, we have focused on large animals. In the ocean, this refers to large fish. We fish, causing their numbers to decrease. After a period of time, we only have a small number of fish left. We use this number as the baseline. The problem is why people are so complacent about this. This is because they do not know that the situation has changed. In fact, many people, especially scientists, oppose this view. They object because the evidence presented in the previous analytical model is not what they want to see. For example, someone tells a story that a certain captain found many fish in a certain area. This story cannot be used as evidence, and fisheries scientists usually do not adopt it because it is not "scientific". This creates a situation: people know nothing about the past. Although we live in a civilized society, they do not believe the source of information about the past, nor do they understand the significant role of marine protected areas. Because we actually reshape the past through marine protected areas. We have reshaped the past, making it impossible for people to imagine what it was like in the past because the baseline has changed dramatically, becoming extremely low. This applies to those who see a marine protected area and those who benefit from its deeper meaning. This enables them to reset their baseline. But what about those who cannot do this? They have no way of knowing. For example, people in the Midwest. I think art and movies can fill this gap. There is also a primitive simulation. This is a primitive simulation of Chesapeake Bay. Long ago, gray whales lived in Chesapeake Bay. That was 500 years ago. You will notice the color tone is very similar to "Avatar" (laughter). I won't talk about the story of "Avatar" and why people are moved by the images in it. It's because it evokes something we have lost. My only suggestion is that I hope Cameron's "Avatar 2" can be filmed underwater. Thank you very much, everyone.
Hello. I'm Kevin Allocca. I'm the Trends Manager for YouTube, and my job is to watch YouTube videos. That's true. So today we're going to talk about why some videos become viral and even important. We all want to be stars - celebrities, singers, comedians - and when I was young, that was very, very difficult to do. But now, online video makes it possible for anyone to create something they want and instantly become famous, becoming part of world culture. Any of you can become famous online, even next Saturday. But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute. Among them, only a tiny fraction will become viral and get millions of views, becoming a sudden cultural phenomenon. How does this happen? Three elements: Trendsetters, Community Participation, and Unpredictability. Okay, let's take a look. Mr. Vasquez: Oh, my goodness. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Wow! Oh, gosh! KA: Last year, Mr. Vasquez uploaded this video, filmed outside his home in Yosemite National Park. In 2010, this video was viewed 23 million times. (Laughter) This chart shows the popularity of the video when it first went viral in late summer. But Mr. Vasquez had no intention of making a viral video. He just wanted to share a rainbow. Because that's what people who call themselves "Yosemitebear" do. He's also uploaded many videos of natural landscapes. This video was actually uploaded in January of last year. So what happened in between? Jimmy Kimmel. A tweet from Jimmy Kimmel helped make this video a hit. Trendsetters like Jimmy Kimmel introduce new and interesting things to us, allowing the audience to discover these things. Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday.♫ ♫ Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend, weekend.♫ ♫ Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday.♫ KA: If it weren't for this video, you might not be thinking about what we're talking about next. Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the biggest videos of the year, attracting nearly 200 million views. This chart shows the trend of its popularity. Similar to Mr. Vasquez's "Double Rainbow", this video suddenly went viral out of nowhere. So, what happened that day? Oh, it was a Friday, the real Friday. If you wonder about those peak periods, they were all on Fridays. But on that particular Friday, what happened? Tosh.0 featured it, and many blogs discussed it. Michael John Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 was the first to mock the video on his Twitter. The key is a group or individual trendsetters who, after watching the video, share their views with the wider audience, speeding up the video's rise to fame. And as this group forms, they share jokes and keep sharing, not only discussing it but also creating their own parodies. So now there are tens of thousands of spoof versions of "Friday" spreading on YouTube. Even from Monday to Sunday, there are different comical imitations. Unlike the one-way entertainment media of the twentieth century, this is a collective participation that makes us a part of the national phenomenon - through dissemination or autonomous innovation. This "Nyan Cat" is a looping animation with continuous background music. That's it, just like that. It has been watched as many as 50 million times this year. If you think this is incredible, you will find it even more difficult to imagine that there is a three-hour version of this video that attracted four million viewers. There are even cats watching this video. Cats watching other cats watching this video. But the most important thing is the technology that inspires creativity, the geek network culture. There are also remixes, nostalgic versions, and international versions. The whole remix group became popular and turned this originally foolish joke into something that everyone can participate in. Because now, we not only indulge in it, but we also participate in it. Who could have predicted all of this? Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black, or even "Nyan Cat" (meow meow meow) would become so popular? What kind of script would you write that would include these creations? In this network video world where enough content for two days is uploaded every minute, only unique and unimaginable videos can attract attention. A friend of mine strongly recommended a great video made by someone protesting New York City's bike fines, and I have to admit I wasn't initially interested. Cassie Neistat: I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane, but there are so many obstacles that make it impossible to ride properly in the bike lane. Kevin: In an unexpectedly humorous way, Casey Neistat attracted five million viewers with his interesting ideas and arguments. This approach applies to everything we innovate. So it raises this question for us... Mr. Vasquez: What does this represent? Oh... Kevin: What does it mean? Trendsetters, creative communities, and eccentrics are the characteristics of new media and culture, where everyone can participate and let the audience define what is popular. As I mentioned earlier, now the most popular artist, Justin Bieber, also rose to fame on YouTube. Your idea doesn't need permission from anyone. In the self-created popular culture, we all have the autonomy. However, all of this is not a feature of the old media, nor can it fully represent today's media, but it will definitely become the entertainment form of future media. Thank you.
10 minutes may not be enough for me to tell you about the bond between three generations of women and the amazing power of this bond. It tied together a 4-year-old girl, her younger sister, mother, and grandmother for five days and nights on a small boat drifting in the China Sea over 30 years ago. The memory has stayed with the little girl and she now resides in San Francisco, telling you a continuing story that is like a puzzle being pieced together. Please allow me to share a few pieces of it.The first image that comes to mind is a man working hard, putting all his effort into it. He was a poet and playwright who devoted his entire life to the unification and freedom of his country. As a communist, he imagined himself entering Ho Chi Minh City and faced with a life completely abandoned and friends' ridicule, he remained silent. As history, he is long gone, and I never truly knew him in life. But our lives are richer than memories, and my grandfather has left me with a legacy that I will always remember. My responsibility is to ensure that his experiences were not in vain, and that I learn from them. Yes, history has tried to break us, but we have endured.The next puzzle piece is a small, flat boat quietly sliding into the sea at dawn. My mother, Mai, was 18 years old and had just lost her father. She went through a series of marriages and had two little girls. For her, the sole purpose of life was to escape her family and start a new life in Australia, which seemed like a distant dream. Therefore, after four years of contempt, a small boat glided away from the fishing boat and into the open sea. The adults knew the danger of the journey. The greatest threats were pirates, rape, and death. Like all adults, my mother brought a small bottle of poison. If we were caught, my sister, mother, grandmother, and I would take the poison one by one and die. My first memory comes from the small boat -- the steady rhythm of the engine, shallow waves, and an endless horizon. I don't remember how many times the pirates came, but they were scared off by the men on the boat's bluster. The engine stalled and could not be restarted for six hours. But I remember the light reflecting off the oil rig; the young man from the Malaysian coast who died of exhaustion, ending his journey early; and the first apple I tasted, given to me by a man on the same boat. I never ate such a delicious apple again. After three months in a refugee camp, we settled in Melbourne. The next puzzle piece is about the new life created by three generations of women. We settled in Footscray, a working-class suburb primarily made up of immigrants. Unlike settling in other middle-class suburbs, I forgot about my existence, let alone my rights. The smell emanating from the shops seemed to come from another world. People communicated with each other in the same broken English. One thing was the same, we started again. My mother worked on a farm at first, and then she went to work on the car assembly line, working six days a week with two shifts. Sometimes she squeezed in time to learn English and obtained an IT qualification. We were very poor and saved every penny. The leftover money was used to pay for English and math tuition. No matter how difficult it was, even if we had no new clothes to wear, we wore second-hand ones. We wore two pairs of socks to school, one pair covering the holes in the other. The school uniform covered our knees because it had to last for six years. Although rare, the corners of searching for the hymn, occasionally graffiti said, "Asian, go home!" Go home where? Something pierced my heart. A force was gathering, and a quiet voice was saying, "I will surpass you." My younger sister, my mother, and I slept on the same bed. Every night, my mother came home exhausted, but we shared our experiences of the day, listening to the sound of our grandmother's room. My mother has always been plagued by nightmares about the boat. My job is to stay awake and wake her up when she has a bad dream. She opened a computer store, learned beauty, and plans to open a beauty salon in the future. The story about men is without transition, angry, stiff, and problematic like two different worlds. Seeking funding and support, the center was established. I live in a parallel world. On the one hand, I am a typical Asian student, particularly cruel to myself; on the other hand, I am entangled in the dangers of reality, the sadness of violent conflicts, drug abuse, and racial segregation. But after so many years of help, when I graduated as a law student, I was selected as the Australian Young Representative of the Year. I jumped directly from one fragment to another, without a beautiful connection. Tan Le, an ordinary resident of Footscray, now a refugee and social activist, was invited to give a speech and go to a place she had never heard of, a place that is hard to imagine whether it exists. I don't know about protocols, don't know how to use knives, don't talk about wine, and can't speak. I want to return to the comfortable life in the unnamed suburbs where my grandmother, mother, and two daughters have been living for more than 20 years. We talk about the past, gradually fall asleep, and still sleep in the same bed. I told my mother I can't do it. She reminded me that when she took us abroad by boat, I was exactly the same age as I am now. There was no choice. "Let go and be yourself," she said. So I talked about issues of youth unemployment and education, ignoring marginalized groups and deprived political rights. The more frank I am, the more people invite me to speak. Meeting people around me, doing what I love, living even if I completed my studies, I realized that I could not limit myself to the legal profession. There is another fragment of the puzzle here. At the same time, I realized that as an outsider, it is also possible. Recently, the news on the screen is not only possible, but also thanks to the experience from a small boat. Because as an insider, it is too easy to give up your perspective and too easy to accept your assumptions. I have to stand far enough outside the comfort zone now, yes, the world is beginning to break, not as you fear. Do not allow rashness or encourage the amplification of possibilities. There is energy here, ruthless optimism, mixed with humanity and courage. Follow my intuition. I gathered a group where the "impossible" label was our only challenge. For a whole year, we were not cultured. At the end of each day, I made a big pot of soup for everyone to share. We worked hard every night. Most of our ideas were crazy, but there were a few wise ones, and we pushed through. I felt my intuition succeed once again after moving to the US following a trip. Three months after arriving, I continued to adventure. Finally, let me talk about my grandmother. The era she grew up in was dominated by Confucianism and the local Mandarin was prevalent. Life had not changed for centuries. When she was born, her father passed away, and she was raised by her mother alone. She married a Mandarin at the age of 17 and became a concubine, suffering from her mother-in-law's abuse. Without her husband's support, she sued herself in court, causing a sensation, and won the case, which made her famous. (Applause) "Impossible" became possible. When she passed away in Melbourne, 600 miles away, I was taking a shower in my hotel room in Sydney. Through the glass, I saw her standing across the street. I knew she had come to say goodbye. My mother's call came a few minutes later. A few days later, we went to the Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat next to her coffin. We told stories and promised to accompany her. At midnight, the monk told us that he had to cover the coffin. My mother asked us to feel our grandmother's hand. She asked the monk, "Why is my grandmother's hand warm while the other parts are so cold?" "Because you've been holding her hand since morning," he said, "you never let go." If our family has a driving force, it must come from the women. Considering our own selves and the shaping of our lives, we can now foresee that a man must defeat us before he can blend in with us. He must defeat us. Failure comes too easily. Now I want my own child, my own little boat. Who wouldn't want that? However, I'm afraid of privilege, comfort, and rights. Can I bravely paddle the oars that give them life, rowing into every wave with a natural and steady engine, with a broad vision and without any guarantees? I don't know. But I can let go and watch them pass safely, which is also what I hope for. At the same time, Tan also came to the scene today and sat in the fourth and fifth rows.
My story happened in Rajasthan, about two years ago. I was in the desert, under a starry sky, with a Sufi singer, Muttiah Ali. Our conversation was about how nothing has changed since the ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata. Back then, when we wanted to travel, we hopped on a chariot and flew through the sky. Nowadays, we can do the same thing with airplanes. At that time, when the great Indian warrior Arjuna was thirsty, he pulled out an arrow and shot it into the ground, and water would come out. Now we do the same thing with drills and machines. The conclusion we come to is that magic has been replaced by machines. This makes me feel sad. I realize that I am a bit of a technophobe. I fear that I will lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without a camera or Weibo, a social media platform. I feel that technology should be used to create magic, not stifle it. When I was a little girl, my grandfather gave me his small silver pocket watch. This 50-year-old technological gadget became the most magical thing to me. In my imagination, it became a golden gate that led me to a world full of pirates, shipwrecks, and imagination.So I think that our smartphones, our fancy watches, and our cameras stop us from dreaming. They take away our inspiration. Therefore, I delve into the world of technology to see how we can use it to create magic instead of stifling it. I started illustrating books when I was 16, and when I saw the iPad, I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers from all over the world. It knows how we hold it, where we are. It combines images, text, animation, sound, and touch. Storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensory. But what can we do with it? So I actually launched Khoya, an iPad interactive program. It says, "Place your finger on each light," then-- it says, "This box belongs to..." So I enter my name, and I become a character in the book. On different pages, a small letter falls down for me-- because of GPS, the iPad knows where you live and marks it for me. My child was very excited by all these possibilities. Now, I have been talking about magic, not the kind with witches and dragons, but the magic of children, those ideas that we had as kids. For some reason, the idea of fireflies in a jar always excited me. Here, you need to tilt your iPad to let the fireflies out, and they can light up your whole book. Another fascinating idea is when I was a child, the whole galaxy was wrapped up in a marble. So here, every book becomes a little marble, and I put them into this device and it opens up a map. And now, all magical books have maps, but these maps have always been static. This is a map that changes and heats up, becoming your guide for the rest of this book. At some point in this book, it will also show itself. So I'm ready to enter. Another really important thing for me is to create content that is very Indian but also very modern. Here, these are flying beings. We've all heard of fairies and goddesses, but how many people outside of India know about their counterparts, the flying beings? These poor flying beings have been trapped in Indra's little house for thousands of years in an ancient, musty book. So we brought them back and brought them into stories that are contemporary with children. Stories that solve new problems, such as the environmental crisis (music). Speaking of the environmental crisis, I think one of the biggest problems of the last 10 years is that children are stuck in their rooms, glued to their computers, and they can't go out. But now, with mobile technology, we can use technology to take our children out into the natural world. One of the interactions in this book is a directive that requires you to go out into the world with your iPad's camera and collect pictures of different natural objects. When I was a child, I collected various things, such as twigs, rocks, pebbles, and shells. I don't know why children don't collect anymore. So, I brought back this ritual from childhood, and you need to go out and take a picture of a flower in one chapter, then name it. In another chapter, you need to take a picture of tree bark and label it. What happens next is that you actually create a digital collection of photos. You can put it online. A child in London posted a picture of a fox, saying, "Oh, I saw a fox today." A child in India said, "I saw a monkey today." It creates a social network around this digital photo collection you took. With this magic, there are endless possibilities for connecting the earth and technology. In this book, we plan an interaction where you use the video on your iPad and through augmented reality, you see a layer of lively and moving fairies appear on the potted plants outside your house. At some point, your screen is covered with leaves, so you need to make a wind sound to blow them away and then read the section below. We are moving, moving to a world where natural forces and technology are becoming closer, where magic and technology can get closer. We use the energy of the sun to bring our children and ourselves closer to the natural world. And we bring magic and joy, as well as the love of childhood, through a simple media story. Thank you.
I want to talk to everyone about the reasons for the failure of numerous electronic healthcare projects. I think the most important thing is that we haven't listened to the voices of patients. One thing we did at the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands was to appoint a Chief Listening Officer. Not in a very scientific way - she would pour a cup of coffee or tea and ask the patient, family, or relatives, "How are you doing lately? Is there anything we can help with?" I think we would like to believe that this is one of the main reasons why almost all electronic healthcare projects fail - because we don't listen. This is my WiFi weight scale, which is a very simple gadget. It has a switch and every morning I sit on it to weigh myself. Not bad, I set a target for myself. You can see it here. I set my weight target to 95kg. In fact, the whole operation is very simple. As soon as I sit on it, it sends my data to Google Health, and my general practitioner can also receive it. Then he can see if there are any problems with my weight, not wait until something urgent like a heart attack happens before thinking about checking my weight. Instead, he can pay attention to it all the way.But there's one more thing. Some of you may know that I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter. So every morning, I weigh myself with a WiFi-enabled scale. People start talking to me before I even get on the train. "I think you should keep it simple for lunch today, Lu Xian." But that's actually a good thing because it's peer pressure. Peer pressure can help patients - it can help treat obesity and quit smoking. On the other hand, it can also bring people together to participate in some game-like activities to better maintain their health.This feature will be launched next week. There will be a small blood pressure monitor like this that can be connected to a smartphone or other device. Then people can measure their blood pressure at home and send the data to their doctors, and also share it with others. For only a hundred dollars, this is the key. When patients are in their respective positions collecting data, they can not only control themselves but also help us deal with the challenges faced in healthcare, such as skyrocketing medical costs or doubling demand and so on. We need to make technology easy to control to encourage patients who have entered the track. You can achieve this through such technology, or assign tasks to the general public. Today, I will show you a short film about a project we have done. We all have navigation devices in our cars, and even on our phones. We know the location of all ATMs and gas stations in Maastricht, and of course fast food restaurants. But where are the recently developed automatic external defibrillators that can save patients? We asked around, but nobody knew. Now, the automatic external defibrillators that can save lives can be found. We have assigned a task to the public for the entire Netherlands. We created a website that tells people, "If you see an automatic external defibrillator, please mark its location online and note its opening hours." Note that it may not be open 24 hours a day. Over 10,000 AEDs have been marked in the Netherlands. The next step is to develop the corresponding applications. We have developed an iPad application, a Layar application that expands the reality to search for AEDs. If you see someone collapse in Maastricht, you can use your iPhone, and in a few weeks, Microsoft phones can also find the nearest AED to save lives. Today, I want to introduce not only AED4U, which is the name of the product, but also aed4.us. We plan to promote this project globally, and we also call on colleagues and universities from all over the world to help us. Let us work together to identify AEDs worldwide. This way, when you are on holiday and see someone collapse, it may be your relative or just a passerby, you can find the AED. We also want to call on companies around the world to help us verify these AEDs. For example, maybe ask couriers or telegram staff to check if the marked AEDs are still in place. So please help us with this project so that we can not only be healthier but also master it with confidence. Thank you everyone.
Today, I would like to share with you my photography work. Or should I say, is this even a photograph? Because it's clearly a picture, but one that you cannot take with a camera. However, my interest in photography began when I got my first digital camera at the age of 15. It was mixed with my previous passion for painting, but with a difference. When using a camera, the entire process has already been planned out beforehand. When you pick up the camera to take a photo, the process ends when you press the shutter button. So in my opinion, photography is more about the appropriate location and time for shooting. I think anyone can do this, so I wanted to do something special. The special thing is that when you press the shutter button, the whole process has just begun. Like this photo: construction is taking place beside a busy road. (The subject matter is ordinary,) but the technique is unexpected. Despite this, it still retains a sense of realism. Or photos like this, with both dark and colorful elements, but their purpose is to preserve a sense of realism. When I talk about realism, I mean photographic realism. Because this is not something you can really grasp. But I always want it to look like it can be captured in some way. These photos require you to quickly identify the techniques behind them. So it's more about capturing an inspiration than capturing a real moment. But what is the technique that makes these photos look very realistic? Is it about details? Is it about color? Is it about lighting? What leads to this kind of illusion? Sometimes different perspectives create different illusions, but ultimately it comes down to how we understand the world and how this understanding can be expressed in a two-dimensional space. This is not about what is true, but about what we think looks like the truth. So, I believe that these basic principles are actually quite simple. I see it as a puzzle of the real world where you can put together different fragments of the real world to create another kind of reality.Let me give you a simple example. Here are three completely imaginable and real objects that we can find in the real three-dimensional world. But if we combine these objects in a certain way, we can create a visually three-dimensional object that looks like it could exist, but at the same time, we know it cannot exist. So this is how we deceive our own brains because our brains refuse to accept the fact that this object does not actually exist. The same goes for composite photos. They are indeed just a combination of different images from reality. Thus, what makes a photo look realistic are those things that we normally do not think about, but are found everywhere in daily life. However, when we combine photos, it is worth our special attention, otherwise the result will look awkward. What I want to say is that we need to follow three simple principles to achieve a realistic effect. You see, these images are not particularly special, but when combined, they can create such a picture. Therefore, the first principle is that all combined photos must have the same perspective. Second, the combined photos must have the same lighting. These two photos meet these two requirements. The third principle is to make it difficult for people to discern the joints between these different photos, making the joints look seamless and causing anyone to be unable to tell how the picture was created. By matching the color, contrast, and brightness of different photo edges, and adding some photographic flaws, such as depth of field, desaturation, and noise, we can eliminate the boundaries between different photos and make them look like a single photo. Even if one photo can contain hundreds of layers, here is an example. Some people may think that this is just a landscape photo with the lower part processed, but this photo is actually composed of many different photos taken in different places. Personally, I think it is easier to create a place than to find it because you don't have to compromise with your own brain's ideas. But this does require a lot of planning. When I came up with this idea last winter, I knew I had a few months to plan it, and basically had to go to different places to find the pictures needed for this puzzle. Like this fish was captured during a fishing trip, the coast was photographed at a different location, and the underwater part was taken at a quarry. By the way, I also adjusted the color of the houses on the island to red to make it look more Swedish. To achieve a realistic effect, I think planning is the most important thing. There is always a rough idea or concept first, and then different photos are combined. Each image here has been carefully planned. If you can capture good photos, the effect will be beautiful and realistic. So, all the tools are there, and the only thing limiting us is our imagination. Thank you, everyone.
Since I often explain to people how wonderful the upcoming new technologies will be, I want to share my true thoughts with my friends here and try to review and understand how this happened with the amazing technological progress. Technological advances seem to be so fast that we can hardly keep up with their pace. Let me start with a boring page of technology slides. Then the slides can start to be shown. This is just one that I randomly selected from my files. What I want you to see is not its details, but its overall form. This is what we did on the slide about the power analysis of RISC processors and local networks. Interestingly, this slide, like many slides we are familiar with, is a straight line on a semi-logarithmic curve graph. Each layer here represents a level of performance size. Discussing technology on a semi-logarithmic graph is new and somewhat peculiar. This is basically what I'm going to say next. Can you please turn on the lights? Can you turn up the lights a little bit because I need to use a piece of paper. Why do we use logarithmic curves to depict technology curves? Well, the answer is, if I use an ordinary curve to draw, we say, this is the year, this is some point in time, this is some measure of technology that I'm going to draw, it looks a bit silly. It looks something like this. And it doesn't provide much information. Now, if I draw, say, another kind of technology, like transportation, on a semi-logarithmic curve, it looks stupid, like a flat line. But if there's a qualitative change like this. If transportation technology improves as fast as microprocessor technology, then tomorrow I'll be able to take a taxi and get to Tokyo in 30 seconds. But it hasn't improved that fast. In the history of technological development, there's no precedent for this self-sufficient, doubling every few years kind of growth. Now, what I want to ask is, if you look at these exponential curves, they don't go on forever. Things can't keep changing that fast. Two things can happen, either it will become this typical S-curve until some completely different situation emerges, or it will become like this. That's all that's possible. Now, I'm an optimist, so I think it's very likely that it will become like this. If that's the case, it means that we're in a transitional period. We seem to be on this line, in the transition from the past to the future of the world. All I've been asking myself is, where is the future path of the world? What will the new era it tends to be like? Because this change seems very, very confusing when we're in it. When I was a kid, growing up, the future was like 2000, and people were all talking about what would happen in 2000. Now, at this conference, people are talking about the future, and you can find that the future still refers to that "2000." That's as far as we can get. In other words, in my lifetime, the future is getting shorter and shorter. I think the reason is that we all feel that something is happening. Change is happening. We can all sense it. We know it's pointless to think about the next 30 or 50 years, because everything will be so different that speculating about the future will no longer make sense. So I'm going to talk about what it will be like, what the changes we are going through will be like. To achieve this goal, I have to introduce a bunch of things that have nothing to do with technology and computers. Because the only way I can understand this is to look back and stretch the timeline. The timeline I want to look at is the span of time on Earth's life. I think this picture makes sense if you look at it from a span of several billion years each time. So if you go back about 2.5 billion years, the Earth was so big, a barren piece of rock floating with some chemical substances on it. If you observe how these chemical substances are combined, we begin to understand how they are formed. I think some theories start from understanding how life evolves from nucleic acids, but I want to tell a simple story of life, that at that time, there were droplets of oil floating around, with various combinations of different chemical components inside. Some of these oil droplets contained a special chemical composition, which allowed them to gather chemical substances from the outside and slowly grow. Oil droplets like this began to differentiate and separate. The most primitive ones formed cells to some extent, these tiny oil droplets. But so far, these oil droplets are not really alive, at least not in our current understanding, because each one is a random synthesis of chemical substances. Every time they divide, the chemicals inside are not evenly distributed. So every oil droplet is a bit different. In fact, the different ways of the oil droplets make them better integrate the surrounding compounds, grow larger, absorb more, and divide more. So they live longer and perform more. This is a bit like a very simple chemical form of life, but the process becomes interesting when these oil droplets learn a technique that provides information. Somehow, in a way we cannot fully understand, these small oil droplets learned to record information. They learned to record the secret of cell formation on a special substance called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). That is to say, they came up with a spontaneous way of evolution to write down the way their genetic information is recorded so that this recording method can be replicated. Amazingly, this recording method seems to be stable and has evolved 2.5 billion years ago. In fact, the composition of our genes is exactly the same code, the same recording method. In fact, any organism is recorded with exactly the same letters and codes. In fact, what I am doing is just a fun thing, which is that we can use this code to record events. I have 100 micrograms of white powder here, and I will do my best to prevent airport security from finding them. But there is a code inside. What I am doing is that I am holding this code, which contains the standard letters we use to mark it, and then I write my business card on a strand of DNA and magnify it 10 to the 22nd power. So if anyone needs millions of my business cards, I have enough for everyone here, even everyone in the world, right here. If I were an arrogant person, I would put it in a virus and spread it around the room. So what's the next step? Recording DNA is an interesting step. It led to the formation of cells - and they have been happy for billions of years. But there is another interesting stage, things began to become completely different, that is, these cells began to exchange and communicate information, thus forming cell communities. I don't know if you know this, but bacteria can actually exchange DNA. That's why, for example, antibiotic resistance has evolved. Some bacteria know how to avoid penicillin, then it creates this DNA information and travels around in other bacteria, and now we have many bacteria that are immune to penicillin, because bacteria communicate information. In this way, these communications lead to the formation of communities, and in a sense, they are on the same boat; they cooperate. Therefore, they survive together or die together, that is to say, if a community succeeds, all individuals in the community can replicate more and evolve more advantageously. So the turning point is reached when these populations are very close, in fact, they come together and decide to write down the composition spectrum of the entire population on a strand of DNA. The next interesting phase in life will take billions of years. In this period, there are multi-cellular communities, which are communities of many different types of cells that cooperate as organisms. In fact, we are such a multi-cellular community. We have many cells, and they are no longer just for their own survival. Skin cells are useless without heart cells, muscle cells, brain cells, and so on. So these communities began to evolve. What happens is interesting evolution that no longer involves only single cells, but instead, we call it a community of organisms. What happens next is within these communities. These cell communities, once again, begin to extract information. They begin to construct a very special structure specifically for processing information within the community. These are called neural structures. So neurons are the information processing devices established by these cell groups. In fact, experts and special structures begin to emerge in the community that are responsible for recording, understanding, and learning information. This is the brain and nervous system of these cell groups. This gave them favorable conditions for evolution. Because of this, for each individual, learning can occur within the time span of a single organism, rather than the entire evolutionary time span. So an organism can, for example, learn not to eat a certain fruit because it tastes bad and made them sick last time. This can happen in the lifespan of a single organism, whereas before the building of this special information processing structure, it would have taken thousands of years of evolutionary learning through individuals dying after eating that fruit. So the fact that the nervous system and biological construction of this special structure greatly accelerated the process of evolution. Because from here, evolution can happen within the individual. It can occur within the time span of learning. But what happens next is that every individual discovers, of course, the secret of communication. For example, the most sophisticated version we know of is human language. Think about it, it's a wonderful invention. I have a complex, confusing, and bewildering idea in my head. I am sitting here, basically just speaking words, hoping to create in your minds a similar kind of confusion to the one I have. But we are converting something very complex into sound, a series of sounds that produce very complex things in your brain. So now we are starting to operate as individual organisms. In fact, what we have accomplished is that we, as humans, have begun to separate ourselves. We are going through the same stage as a multicellular organism - extracting the way we record, display, and process information. For example, the invention of language is a small step in this direction. Telephones, computers, DVDs, CDs, and so on are our special mechanisms that we are constructing in society to process information. These all connect us, making us larger, faster, and more capable of evolution than before. So now evolution can occur on a subtle time scale. You have seen Ty's little example of evolution, which seems to be displayed on the convolution program right in front of you. So now we are speeding up the time scale again. The first step of the story I am telling took billions of years, each step taking many billions of years. The next step, such as the development of the nervous system and brain, took millions of years. Following that, the development of language and other things took less than a million years. The next step, like electronic devices, seemed to take only a few decades. This process is self-sustaining, and I think it should be described as self-catalytic, as the rate of change accelerates as things change more. I think this is the exponential curve we are seeing here. We see this process feeding back on itself. Now my job is to design computers that I know could not have been designed without recent advances in computer technology. Now, what I'm doing is designing objects that are so complex that they cannot be designed in the traditional sense. I don't know the function of each transistor on the machine. There are billions of transistors. In fact, what I'm doing is what machine designers do. We think it is for some degree of information extraction and then pass it on to the machine, which applies it to a deeper and faster extent than we could before. In fact, sometimes the methods it uses are not well understood by us. One especially interesting thing that I have been using recently is evolution itself. What we are doing is putting an evolutionary process into the machine, which can happen over subtle time spans. For example, in most extreme cases, we can actually evolve a program starting from a random sequence of instructions. So I can say, "Computer, generate 100 million random instruction sequences. Now run all these random instruction sequences, run all the programs, and pick the one closest to what I want." That is, I define what I want. Assuming I need to classify data, this is a simple example that I have experimented with. Find the program that is closest to classifying the data. Of course, a random sequence of instructions is very unlikely to classify data, so none of them will be able to do it. But there might be one that gets lucky and manages to order two numbers in sequence. I say, "Computer, please now select the top 10 percent of sequences that perform best. Save these and delete the others. Now let's replicate the best-performing classifiers. Use a similar recombination process to mating to produce offspring. Take two programs, exchange their subroutines, and let them generate offspring that inherit the characteristics of the subroutines from both programs." So I get a new generation of programs that are made up of combinations that work better. Say, "Please repeat this process." Do it again. Perhaps introduce some mutations. Try again and apply it to the new generation. Each program in this generation only needs a few milliseconds. So in a few minutes on the computer, I can do an evolution process equivalent to millions of years, or, in more complex situations, complete it in a few hours. At the end, I get the program that perfectly classifies the data. In fact, these programs are more efficient than any program I write by hand. Now, if I read these programs, I can't tell how they work. I've tried reading and explaining how they work. They are very abstract and strange. But they can do the job. In fact, I know, I am confident, they can do the job because they come from millions of programs that can do what we think. In fact, their lives depend on this job. Once I sat on a 747 with Marvin Minsky, and he pulled out a card and said, 'Look, look at this. It says, 'This aircraft has many precision components working together to ensure your safety during the flight.' Does this give you confidence?' In fact, we know that the engineering process is complicated and does not work well. So we start to rely on computers to do a process that is very different from engineering. It allows us to produce more complex things than ordinary engineering can produce. However, we still do not understand its choices." From a certain perspective, computers are ahead of us. We are now using these programs to create faster computers so that we can run this process faster. So it is self-reinforcing. It is getting faster and that is why I feel like computers are somewhat elusive. Because all these technologies are feeding back into themselves. We are taking off. We are at a point in time that is like the moment when a single-celled organism is turning into a multicellular organism. We are like a caterpillar. We don't know what we are creating. We are at a turning point. But I think there is something following us. "I think it worships us and sees us as the ultimate product of evolution. I believe that all of us are part of reproduction, no matter what the next step is. Lunchtime is almost here, so before I'm chosen, I think I'll end it here."
In today's medical culture, I think a part of the culture needs to start changing, and that change can start with a doctor like me. Perhaps it's because I've been practicing medicine for many years, and I can afford to give up some empty fame and fortune to start such a change. Before getting to the point, let's talk about baseball. Why not? The regular season is almost over, and the World Series is about to begin. We all love baseball, don't we? The world of baseball is filled with thousands of jaw-dropping statistics. The upcoming movie "Moneyball" is all about statistics and how to build a great team based on these data. I want to talk about a statistic that I hope everyone has heard of called batting average. When we say that a hitter has a batting average of .300, we mean that the player is very consistent and gets a hit three times out of every ten at-bats. A hit means that the ball is hit into the outfield and is not immediately caught, and is not thrown back in time before the runner reaches first base. Three hits out of ten at-bats. Do you know how Major League Baseball comments on players with batting averages above .300? It's great, very great, like a star player. Do you know how they refer to a player with a batting average of .400, which means that they get four hits out of every ten at-bats? He is a legend - a legend like Ted Williams - he was the last player in Major League Baseball to have a batting average of over .400 during the regular season. Now let's go back to my world - the field of medicine. This is a field I am familiar with, but what I am about to say next troubles me. Suppose you have appendicitis, and you are referred to a surgeon with a batting average of .400 in appendectomy surgeries. That sounds strange, doesn't it? Now, suppose you live in a remote area, and both of your loved one's coronary arteries are blocked. Your family doctor refers her to a cardiologist with a batting average of .200 in angioplasty procedures. But wait, did you know? Her performance has improved greatly this year, and her level is also recovering. Her batting average has reached .250. But even so, this is still unacceptable. And now I want to ask you a question. Do you think that the "batting average" of a cardiac surgeon, a professional nurse, an orthopedic surgeon, an obstetrician-gynecologist, or an emergency medical technician should be? 100%? Very good. In fact, no one in the medical community knows what the "batting average" of a good surgeon, physician, or emergency medical technician should be. We put each of them, including myself, on the professional position and admonish them to demand perfection -- absolutely, absolutely cannot make a wrong diagnosis -- but we let them think about the details and how to achieve such standards. This is the information I received in medical school. I am a student with OCD tendencies. In high school, a classmate once said that Brian Goldman would review for a blood test. And I did. I completed my studies in a small attic in the nurse's residence of the Toronto General Hospital, not far from here. I memorized everything. I memorized the origin and extension of every muscle mentioned in anatomy class, the branching system of every artery extending from the aorta, and all obscure or common differential diagnoses. I even knew how to differentiate between different types of renal tubular acidosis. During this time, I accumulated more and more knowledge. I performed well and graduated with honors. When I graduated from medical school, I felt that as long as I remembered and understood everything - or, to take a step back, almost everything - my chances of making a medical error would be extremely low. And I didn't make a mistake for a while. Until I met Dr. Drucker. When Dr. Drucker was brought to the emergency room of a teaching hospital in Toronto, I was working there as an intern. At the time, I was on rotation in the cardiology clinic due to my cardiology rotation. My job was to diagnose patients in the emergency room when emergency medical personnel needed specialized consultations on the heart and to report back to the attending physician in charge. When I saw Drucker, her breathing was already very weak. When I spoke with her, I heard wheezing in her breathing. When I listened to her chest with a stethoscope, the crackling sounds on both sides told me that she had congestive heart failure. This is because the heart, after failing, cannot pump out all the blood completely, causing some of the blood to flow back into the lungs. The lungs are filled with blood, causing shortness of breath. This is not a difficult diagnosis. After making the diagnosis, I began to treat her. I prescribed aspirin and gave her medication to relieve the burden on her heart. I also gave her diuretics, commonly known as water pills, to help her eliminate excess water in her body. In the next hour or two, she began to feel better, and I felt happy as well. However, at this point, I made my first mistake: I let her go home. To be precise, I made two mistakes. I let her go home before reporting to my attending physician. I didn't do what I should have done, picked up the phone and called my attending to let him see this case and have the opportunity to personally meet this patient. My attending knew her, so he could provide more detailed medical history. Maybe I had a reason to do this. Perhaps I didn't want to be a supervised intern. Perhaps I wanted to be independent and take care of his patients without communicating with my attending. And my second mistake was even more serious. When I let her go home, I ignored a tiny voice inside me. This voice tried to tell me, "Goldman, this is not good, don't do this." Actually, at that time I lacked so much confidence that I even sought advice from the nurse who was taking care of Mrs. Drucker: "Do you think it's okay to send her home?" The nurse thought for a moment, then said matter-of-factly, "Hmm, I think it's fine." All of this still feels like it happened just yesterday. I signed off on the discharge papers and the ambulance came and the paramedics took her home. Afterwards, I went back to work at the clinic. In the following day, that afternoon, my stomach was churning. But I continued to work as usual. When I finished work, I tidied up and left the hospital. On my way to the parking lot to get my car, I did something I don't normally do. I borrowed a coat from the emergency room. And it was there, from another nurse, not the one who had taken care of Mrs. Drucker, that I heard the three words most emergency room doctors dread. Other doctors in other departments also fear these three words, but because the patients that emergency room doctors see come and go in a hurry, these three words have special significance for us. Those three words are: Do you remember?"Do you remember the patient you sent home?" The nurse asked matter-of-factly."She's back." She said it in such a casual tone. And she was back. Back on the brink of death. About an hour after I sent her home, she collapsed on the ground, and her family called 911. The paramedics brought her back to the emergency room. By then, she was in severe shock, with a blood pressure of only 50. Her breathing was extremely faint, and her face was blue. The paramedics tried everything they could. They gave her medication to raise her blood pressure and connected her to a respirator. I was shocked and scared out of my mind. After they stabilized her condition, they sent her to the intensive care unit, and I was like riding a roller coaster because I hoped she would wake up. But in the next two or three days, the likelihood of her waking up became increasingly slim. Her brain had suffered irreversible damage. Her family gathered together. In the next eight to nine days, they slowly accepted the fact. On the ninth day, they chose to let her leave this world -- Mrs. Drucker, a wife, mother, and grandmother. Some people say you never forget the names of those (who passed away due to your negligence). And that was the first time I realized the reality of this statement. In the following weeks, I was extremely depressed and experienced for the first time the dangerous shame that exists in medical culture - I felt lonely and helpless. It was not the healthy kind of shame that you can discuss with your colleagues. It was the kind of shame that you feel when you break a promise to keep a secret from your best friend, and they find out. Even though you may argue and fight, the feeling of guilt remains, and you tell yourself that you will never make the same mistake again. This shame has a teaching function. The kind of shame I felt at the time made me feel ashamed of myself. It told me that it wasn't just what I did that was wrong, but that I was a bad person. And it wasn't because of my attending physician; he was a very good person. He talked to the family well, and I'm sure he smoothed things over for me to ensure that I wasn't sued. But I kept asking myself these questions: Why didn't I contact my attending physician at the time? Why did I let her go home? And when I felt even more frustrated, I would ask: Why did I make such a stupid mistake? Why did I choose to enter the medical field? Slowly but steadily, that awful feeling began to fade. I started to feel better. Then on a cloudy day, when I saw a beam of sunlight peeking through the clouds, I thought, maybe I could feel good again. Then I made a promise to myself: if I double my efforts to be perfect and not make mistakes again, please let that self-blaming voice go away. And the voice did stop. I went back to work. But the mistake happened again. Two years later, when I was working as a resident in the emergency room of a community hospital in north Toronto, I saw a 25-year-old man with a sore throat. The clinic was busy at the time, so I was also in a hurry. He kept pointing to his throat. I took a look and his throat was slightly swollen and red. I prescribed him penicillin and sent him on his way. Even as he walked out the clinic's door, he seemed to be pointing at his throat. Two days later, it was my turn to be on duty in the emergency room. At that time, my supervisor asked me to come to her office for a private conversation. She said those three words: "Do you remember?" "Do you remember? That patient with the sore throat you saw?" As it turns out, he did not have strep throat. He had a potentially life-threatening condition called epiglottitis. You can search for it on Google, but it is not a throat infection but an infection of the upper respiratory tract, which can cause airway obstruction. Fortunately, he did not pass away. After being arranged to receive intravenous antibiotics for a few days, he recovered. And I returned to that time of guilt and self-blame, and then returned to my job after my emotions subsided, until these mistakes happened again. During the same emergency room shift, I twice failed to detect that patients had appendicitis. It is hard to imagine such a thing happening, especially when you are working in a hospital where you only see fourteen patients in one night. Although I did not let either of them go home, I do not think there were any gaps or mistakes in the treatment process. I diagnosed one of them with kidney stones. My colleague re-diagnosed one of them with kidney stones and arranged for a kidney X-ray, but the results were normal. When he noticed that the patient's lower right abdomen was a bit soft, he contacted a surgeon. Another patient had severe diarrhea. I gave him some fluids to help him replenish his fluids and asked my colleague to take another look. He did. When he noticed that the patient's lower right abdomen was a bit soft, he also contacted a surgeon. Both patients underwent surgery and recovered. But whenever I think of these two cases, that feeling of torment still gnaws at me. And I also hope that I can tell you that the most serious mistakes I have made only happened in the first five years of my medical practice, as many of my colleagues have said. But that's complete nonsense. In the past five years, I have made some mistakes too. I still feel lonely, ashamed, and helpless. But the crux of the problem is: If I cannot sort out and discuss the mistakes I have made, and if I cannot find that still small voice that can tell me the source of the mistakes, how can I share my experience with my colleagues? And how can I teach them so that they don't repeat my mistakes? When I enter a gathering - like now - I have no idea how you view me. When was the last time you heard someone talk about their failures, again and again? Yes, you may hear idle chatter about other doctors' errors at a party, but you will never hear someone talk about their own mistakes. If I were to walk into a room full of my colleagues right now and seek their help, and began telling them what I just told you, perhaps before I got through two stories, they would start to feel very uncomfortable. Someone would tell a joke, and then they would change the subject. In fact, if I or one of my colleagues knew of a hospital orthopedic surgeon who had mistakenly amputated a patient's leg, believe me, I wouldn't be able to look him in the eye when I met him. This is the system we have - a complete system of denial of error. In this system, there are only two types of people - those who make mistakes and those who don't, those who can tolerate sleep deprivation and those who can't, and those who have bad outcomes and those who have good outcomes. It's almost like a self-reaction of the immune system, like antibodies attacking that different person. We have an idea: when we kick out all the people who make mistakes from the medical profession, we will have a safe system. But this idea leads to two problems. In my over 20 years of medical broadcasting and news work, from my first article for the Toronto Star to my program "The White Coat, The Black Art," I have personally researched all the medical errors and omissions that I could find. And what I have learned is that errors are absolutely everywhere. We work in a system where mistakes happen every day. Hospitals have a one in ten chance of giving the wrong drug or dose, and the number of cases infected in hospitals is increasing, causing unnecessary harm and death. In this country, nearly 24,000 Canadians have died from preventable medical errors. In the United States, according to the medical college's statistics, the number is over 100,000. Even so, these two figures are still too low because we have never delved into this problem as deeply as we should. The point is, in a hospital system where medical knowledge doubles every two to three years, we cannot keep up with the growth of this knowledge. The situation of insufficient sleep is absolutely very common, and we cannot escape from this problem. Our own intuitive biases can also directly affect our conclusions. For example, I can record a perfect medical history for a patient with chest pain. But if the same patient with chest pain was rambling and had a slight smell of alcohol on his breath at the time, the medical record I wrote would carry a hint of contempt. And this medical record would be completely different. I am not a robot, I will not do the same thing every time. My patients are not cars, they will not describe their symptoms in the same way every time. Therefore, mistakes are inevitable. If we really follow the system I was taught and kick out all medical professionals who are prone to making mistakes, then no one will remain in this field. Another issue is that people are reluctant to talk about their worst mistakes. In my show "The Magic of the White Coat", I've grown accustomed to saying, "This is my worst mistake." I say it to everyone from EMTs to chief cardiac surgeons: "This is my worst mistake, and so on." Then I pass the microphone to them and ask, "What about you?" Their pupils dilate, they recoil, then they look down and swallow hard before telling me their stories. They want to tell their stories, they want to share their stories. They want to be able to say, "Listen, don't make the same mistake I did." They just need a place to do it. They need a redefined medical culture, starting with one doctor and then another. The redefined doctor is also a human being, who understands that she is human and accepts it. She doesn't think it's honorable to make mistakes, but she can learn from them and teach others. She shares her experiences with others and offers support when others talk about their mistakes. She doesn't have a mentality of kicking someone when they're down, but instead points out others' mistakes in a caring and understanding way that can benefit everyone. The medical culture she works in acknowledges that the entire system is run by people, and when people run a system, mistakes are inevitable from time to time. This is the only way for the system to continue to evolve and reform, and to create remedial plans that make it easier for people to detect these unavoidable errors. At the same time, we can cultivate a caring work environment and encourage everyone who observes our healthcare system to point out potential errors at any time. Especially for people like me, who are encouraged to face and correct our mistakes head-on when we make them.I'm Brian Goldman, I'm a redefined doctor. I'm human and I make mistakes. I'm sorry for that, but I'll try my best to learn from them and teach others. I still don't know how you all perceive me, but I think I can accept that. Finally, let me end with my own three words: I remember.
Do you know how many decisions you make on average every day in your daily life? Do you know how many decisions you make on average every week? Recently, I conducted a survey among over 2000 Americans, and the results showed that a typical American makes an average of 70 decisions per day. In addition, there was a recent study of CEOs in which scientists followed CEOs for a week and recorded all the different activities and tasks they participated in and completed, as well as the time they spent making decisions related to these tasks. From this, scientists found that each CEO on average completes about 139 tasks per week, each consisting of many small decisions. Of these decisions, 50% were made in nine minutes or even less. Only 12% of the decisions took an hour or longer. Think about the decisions you make every day. Do you know how many of them are "nine-minute decisions" and how many are one-hour choices? How are you doing in managing these choices? Today, I want to talk about the most serious choice problem we face in modern society: having too many choices. I want to talk about these problems and some feasible solutions. Now I am going to ask you some questions, and I hope to get your answers. So when I ask you a question, don't raise your hand unless you just want to burn some calories since I can't see you. (Laughter) Otherwise, if your answer is "yes," I hope you can applaud. So, the first question I have for you today is: Are you ready to hear about the problem of having too many choices? (Applause from the audience) Thank you. When I was an undergraduate student at Stanford University, I used to go to a very high-end grocery store, at least at that time it seemed very high-end. Its name is Draeger's. Going to that store was like going to an amusement park. They had 250 different types of mustard and vinegar, over 500 different types of vegetables and fruits, and more than 24 different types of bottled water, and that was in the days when we were still drinking tap water. I used to love going to this store, but one day I asked myself, "Why don't you ever buy anything?"This is the aisle where they sell olive oil. They have over 75 different types of olive oil, including some that are locked in boxes and come from olive trees that are 4,000 years old. So one day, I decided to visit the manager of this store, and I asked him, "Is this model of providing people with all these choices really useful?" Then he pointed to the throngs of tourists who come every day, camera in hand. We decided to do a small experiment and chose jam as the test product. This is the aisle where they sell jam. They have 148 different types of jam. At the entrance of the store, we set up a small tasting table. There, we displayed six or 24 different flavors of jam, and then we observed two things: first, in what circumstances were people more willing to stop and taste some jam? Comparatively, about 60% of people stopped at the aisle with 24 types of jam, while only 40% did so when there were only six types of jam. The other thing we observed was in what circumstances were people more willing to buy a jar of jam. This is when we noticed the opposite result. Among the people who stopped at the aisle with 24 types of jam, only 3% actually bought any jam. Meanwhile, among those who stopped at the aisle with six types of jam, we found that 30% of them bought jam. Now, if you do the math, the tendency to buy jam increased at least six times when there were only six choices compared to 24. Choosing not to buy jam may be a good thing for us, at least for our waistlines, but the results prove that too many choices can even affect us in very important decisions. We might even choose to give up our options even if it goes against our best interests. So now, let's introduce our topic today: financial management. I'm going to tell you about a study I did with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamerica, and Wei Jang, on the choices made by nearly a million Americans among over 650 different pension plans across the United States. We studied whether the number of fund options in these plans affects people's likelihood to save for the future. We found that there was indeed a correlation. So we selected 657 different plans that offered 2 to 59 fund options. We found that, in fact, the more fund options offered, the lower the participation rate. So if you look at the extreme case, plans that offer only two funds have a participation rate of around 70%, which is still not as high as we expected. Plans that offer close to 60 fund options have a participation rate of only 60%. Thus, even if you do choose to participate in a plan, having too many options can still have a negative impact. So for those who choose to participate, the more options they have, the more likely they are to completely avoid stocks or similar funds. The more options there are, the more likely people are to put their money into a simple savings account. Now, neither of these extreme choices is a good choice when considering the future life of a friend. In the past decade, we have observed the negative impact caused by providing people with more and more choices. They are increasingly likely to delay the process of making choices, even if doing so would harm their own interests. People are more likely to make worse choices - worse financial choices, medical choices. People are more likely to choose options that they are not satisfied with, even if objectively speaking, those choices are not that bad. This is because, although we enjoy seeing rows of high walls built by mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, and jam, we are unwilling to compare them ourselves and make choices in such a large display. So today, I want to introduce you to four simple techniques - they are reliable techniques that you can easily apply in business and have been tested many times. First: Simplification. You may have heard of it before, but this concept has never been as applicable in previous societies as it is today - "less is more." Every time I say "simplification," people always get angry. They are worried that doing so will lead to them losing their own space. However, in fact, what we have observed is that the more willing a person is to give up unnecessary choices, the more the turnover increases and prices decrease, and the more the principle experience improves. When a cleaning company reduced the number of different types of Head & Shoulders shampoo from 26 to 15, sales increased by 10 percent. When Gold Cat company stopped selling its ten worst-selling cat food products, profits increased by 87 percent - a win-win solution that both increased sales and reduced costs.As you know, a typical grocery store now offers you 45,000 products to choose from. A typical Walmart offers you 100,000 products. However, the ninth-largest retailer in the world today is Aldi, which offers customers only 1,400 products - one type of canned tomato sauce.In the world of finance, I believe the best example of how to manage choices most effectively is David Laibson's deeply invested project at Harvard. Every Harvard staff member is automatically enrolled in a life-cycle fund. Those who choose to do so have 20 different fund options instead of 300 or more. You know, people love to say, "I don't know how to simplify." "These are very important choices." So the first thing I did was ask these employees, "Tell me what makes these choices different from the others. If your employees cannot tell the difference, your customers certainly cannot."This afternoon before the event started, I talked to Gary for a while. Gary told me he was willing to offer everyone here today a trip to the most beautiful road in the world, and completely free. I want you to read the description of this road. Now I'll give you a few seconds to read it yourself. If you're willing to accept Gary's proposal, please applaud. Okay, is anyone willing to accept his proposal? No one else? Okay, anyone willing to accept his proposal? No one else? Alright, let me show you a little more about this. You knew it was a trick, right? (Audience applauds) I thought I would hear more applause. In fact, objectively speaking, you received more information the first time than the second time, but I dare to guess that you feel the second time is more real. Because those pictures make you feel more real. And this example is the second technique we are going to talk about today for dealing with too many choices - concretization. In order for people to better understand the differences between many choices, they must understand the consequences that each choice will bring, and these consequences must be very clear and specific. Why do people spend an average of 15% to 30% more time on ATMs or credit cards than they did today? Because it doesn't feel like real money. So, making the experience more concrete used to be a good way to get people to save. So, in a study that Shlomo Benartzi, Alessandro Previtero, and I conducted with all ING employees, we conducted a study with everyone attending a meeting to register for 401 employee benefits. During the process, we added a little something while keeping each meeting completely the same. What we added was to have each person imagine the wonderful things that could happen in their life if they saved a little more. By doing just that, participation increased by 20%, and the amount people were willing to save, or the amount they were willing to put into their savings accounts, increased by 4%. The third technique: categorization. We can easily handle more categories than choices. For example, we conducted a study on magazine aisles and found that in the Northeast corridor of Wegmans department store, there were 331 to 664 different magazines in the magazine section. But did you know that only a few categories of magazines accounted for 90% of sales? If I showed you 600 magazines first, and then divided them into 10 categories, and then showed you 400 magazines, but divided them into 20 categories, you would believe that when I showed you the 400 magazines, there were more choices and a better selection experience than when I showed you 600 magazines. Because categories help me distinguish their differences.Here are two different jewelry displays, one called "Jazz" and the other called "Swing." If you think the left one is "Swing" and the right one is "Jazz," please applaud. Well, there are some. If you think the left one is "Jazz" and the right one is "Swing," please applaud. A little more this time. You are correct. The left one is indeed "Jazz," and the right one is "Swing," but do you know? This is a very useless classification conspiracy. Categories must tell the chooser something, not create the chooser. You may see this problem in those lengthy lists of funds. Who is the one who should receive the information? My fourth technique is: from simple to complex. In fact, we can handle more information than we think, and what we need to do is to approach it easily. We must gradually increase the complexity. Now I'll give you an example. Let's make a very, very complex decision together: buying a car. Now there is a German manufacturer willing to let you customize a completely personalized car. You have to make 60 different decisions to make this car good. These decisions include the choices provided by each decision. There are 56 choices for the color of the car and the interior color alone. There are four engine and gearbox options. What I'm going to do now is change the order of these decisions to be made. So, the general audience should start with decisions that offer more choices-56 colors and then move on to decisions with fewer choices-four gearbox options. The other half of the audience should start with decisions with fewer choices, four gearbox options, and then move on to 56 car colors, decisions with more choices. What do I want to observe? How active you are. If you keep choosing the default option, it means you have been overwhelmed by choices, which means I am losing your participation. You will find that those who start with decisions with more choices and end with decisions with fewer choices will keep choosing the default option. We will gradually lose them. Those who start with decisions with fewer choices and end with decisions with more choices are still insisting. But the information they get is exactly the same. The choices to be made are also the same. The only thing I did was change the order in which the information appeared. If I give you an easy start and teach you how to choose, even if choosing a transmission option cannot explain my preference for the color inside the car, it can still teach me how to choose. Another thing that excites me is that I have to build such a behemoth, so I become more motivated to participate. Let me summarize the key points. I talked about four tips that can alleviate too many choices - simplify - abandon useless choices; specific - make choices more real; classification - the categories we can afford are more than the choices; simplify complexity. All the techniques I've talked about today are designed to help you manage your choices better - using these techniques is better for you and for the people you serve. So I believe that the key to benefiting most from your choices is to be a little more picky about them. The more picky we are about our choices, the better we become at the art of choosing. Thank you very much.
In the 1980s, in Communist East Germany, if you had a typewriter, you had to register it with the government. You had to provide a sample of text produced by that typewriter. By doing so, the government could track where the text came from. If they found a piece of paper with incorrect views written on it, they could track who had produced those views. In the West, we can't understand how someone could do such a thing, as it would severely restrict freedom of speech. We would never do this in our own country. However, today in 2011, if you buy a color laser printer from any major manufacturer, the printed page will have some small yellow dots printed on each page, which make that page unique to you and your printer. This is happening to us today, and no one seems to be surprised by it. This is an example of how our government is using technology to control us citizens. This is a problem with today's network. One of the three main sources is the online world. If we take a look at what's happening in the online world, we can group it based on the attackers. We have three main groups. We have online criminals. Here, we have Mr. Dmitry Golubov from Kiev, Ukraine. The motivation of online criminals is very easy to understand. These guys do it for money. They make a lot of money through online attacks, a lot of money. In fact, we have several cases of online millionaires, billionaires, who made their fortunes through online attacks. Here is Vladimir Sassen from Tartu, Estonia. This is Alfredo Gonzalez. This is Stephen Watt. This is Bjorn Sundin. This is Matthew Anderson, Talik Alde, and so on and so forth. These people made a lot of money online, but their money was illegal. They stole money from our accounts using Trojan horses similar to banks or by using keystroke logging to collect our credit card information when we conduct online banking or shopping on infected computers. The US Intelligence Agency froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain two months ago, which had 14.9 million US dollars in it when it was frozen. Mr. Jain himself is still at large; no one knows where he is. Today I assert that anyone among us could become a victim of online crime, even beyond the real world. And it's obvious that this situation is getting worse. In the future, most crimes will occur online. The second major group of attackers we are observing today are not motivated by money. Their motivation comes from elsewhere - from protest, from expressing their opinions, from being ridiculed. These anonymous groups have been very active in the past 12 months and have become the main participants in the field of online attacks. These are the three main groups of attackers: criminals for money, active anonymous attackers for protest, and the last group is national, government attacks. Let's take a look at an example, like what happened to DigiNotar. This is a typical example of a government attack against its own people. DigiNotar is a Dutch certificate authority, or it used to be. It went bankrupt last fall because it was hacked. Someone broke in and destroyed it completely. Last week, when I was meeting with representatives of the Dutch government, I asked a leader if he found it possible that someone could die as a result of the DigiNotar attack. His answer was yes. So how exactly can people's deaths be attributed to such an attack? DigiNotar is an authority certificate. They sell certificates. What do you use certificates for? You need certificates in situations where you have a website with HTTPS, SSL encryption services, similar to services like Gmail. Today, all or most of us use Gmail or any of its competitors, and these services are particularly popular in authoritarian countries such as Iran. Dissenters use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more reliable than local services. They encrypt their discussions through SSL connections, so local governments cannot spy on them. They can also issue fake certificates if they attack a foreign authority certificate. This is exactly what happened in the case of DigiNotar. What is the Arab Spring about? For example, what happened in Egypt? In Egypt, thugs looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011, and they found many documents during the looting. In these documents, there is a clip called FINFISHER. Some of the notes in the clip are from a German company that sold a set of tools to the Egyptian government for intercepting -- a large percentage of national public communications. They sold this set of tools to the Egyptian government for 280,000 euros. The company's headquarters are there. So Western governments provide tools to authoritarian governments to oppose their own people. But Western governments do the same to their own people. For example, in Germany, just a few weeks ago, a Trojan horse virus called Scuinst Trojan was found to be used by the German government officials to investigate their own people. If you are a suspect in a criminal case, it is obvious that your phone will be monitored. But today, things have gone beyond that. They will monitor your network connections. A Trojan virus called Scuinst Trojan was recently discovered, which was used by the German government to investigate their own people officially. If you are a suspect in a criminal case, your phone will obviously be monitored. But today, things have gone beyond that. They will monitor your network connection. They will use tools similar to Scuinst Trojan to infect your computer with a Trojan horse, allowing them to monitor all your communications, listen to your online discussions, and collect your passwords. When we think more deeply about these things, people's reaction is obviously "Yes, it sounds bad, but because I am a law-abiding citizen, it won't really affect me. Why should I worry? I have nothing to hide." This is where the argument lies, and it doesn't make sense. Privacy is self-evident. Privacy doesn't need to be discussed. This is not a privacy versus security issue, but a freedom versus control issue. In 2011, we trust our government. We will lose any power we give up forever. Will we trust future governments, blindly trust a government 50 years from now? These are the issues we need to worry about for the next 50 years.
This is where I live, Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi National Park. Behind me are my father's cows. Behind the cows is Nairobi National Park. The southern part of the park is not completely fenced, which means that wild animals like zebras can move freely outside the park. Predators like lions follow them and hunt our livestock. This is one of the cows that was killed at night. I found it dead in the morning and felt heartbroken because it was our only bull. Maasai people believe that we came from heaven with our animals and homeland, and we live with them, so that's why we value them so much. So I gradually became very disgusted with lions. The Maasai are all warriors, and they protect our families and livestock. But they are also frustrated with this problem and have no solution. So they decided to kill these lions. This is one of the six lions they killed in Nairobi National Park. I think this is why there are so few lions in Nairobi Park. In our clan, every boy between the ages of six and nine has the responsibility of defending their father's cows. The same thing happened to me. So I had to find a solution. The first idea that came to my mind was to use fire because I knew lions were afraid of fire. But I realized that this was not effective and actually helped the lions by exposing our cattle shed. However, I did not give up, and I persisted. So I came up with a second idea: to use a scarecrow. I wanted to deceive the lions and make them think that I was standing next to the cowshed. But lions are very smart. They saw the scarecrow on the first day and then left. But the next day, they came back and said, "This thing has never moved. He has been here all along." So they jumped in and killed the animals. One evening, I walked around the cowshed with a flashlight, but the lions did not come that night. I began to realize that the lions were afraid of moving light. So I had an idea. As I was a child at the time, I could spend a whole day tinkering in my room. I even dismantled my mother's newly purchased radio into pieces. She almost killed me that day, but I learned a lot about electronics.So I found an old car battery, an indicator, and a switch. The indicator was a small device found in a motorcycle that was used to control the turn signals and make the light blink. At the same time, I found a switch that could control the on and off of the light. The light bulb came from a broken flashlight. Everything was ready.As you can see, the battery is charged by a solar panel, and the battery provides energy to the indicator. I called this a "transformer." The indicator then causes the light to flash. You can see that the light bulb is facing outward because the lions come from that direction. When the lions approach at night, this is what they see. The flashing light deceives them, and they think I'm walking around the cowshed. In fact, at this time, I'm dreaming in my bed. Thank you. Two years ago, I installed this device in my home, and since then, we haven't had any trouble with lions preying on our poultry. My neighbors have all heard of this method. One of them is this old lady. Her house has a lot of poultry that were preyed upon by lions. She asked me if I could help her install such a light in her home. I gladly agreed. I installed these lights, and you can see behind me that these are the lion-chasing lights. So far, I have installed this lion-chasing light for seven families in our community, and they are very useful. Now, my method has been used by all Kenyans to drive away other similar predators, such as hyenas, leopards, etc. They are also used to drive elephants away from human farms. I was also fortunate to receive a scholarship for this invention, which was awarded by the best school in Kenya - Brookhouse International School. I am very excited about this. My new school has also joined in and helped me increase my visibility and raise more funds. I even brought my friends back to my community to help them install it in homes without lion lights. I taught them how to install it.A year ago, I was just an ordinary boy helping my father herd cattle on the tropical savannah. I often watched planes fly over and told myself: one day, I'll be in there too. Today, I made it. I got the chance to fly to TED for the first time. So, my great dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up.I used to hate lions, but now, because of my invention, which saved my father's cattle and the lions, we can finally coexist peacefully with them. Thank you very much (in Kenyan). In my language, it means "thank you very much!" Chris Anderson: You wouldn't believe how inspiring it is to hear your story. So you've got this scholarship. Richard Turere: Yes.CA: Are you working on another electronic invention? What's your next plan?RT: My next invention, I want to do an electric fence.CA: Electric fence?RT: I know, electric fence is already there, but I just want to do my own.CA: You've tried once before, right, but you--RT: I had tried before, but I stopped because it scared me.CA: It's going to be a battle. Richard Turere, you're special. We're cheering you on every step of the way, my friend. Thank you very much.RT: Thank you.
When I was a child, I believed that my country was the best in the world. As I got older, I learned a song called "No Envy" and felt proud of it. At school, we spent a lot of time learning about Kim Il-sung's history, but we never knew much about the outside world except that the United States, South Korea, and Japan were our enemies. Although I often dreamed of the outside world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until everything suddenly changed.When I was seven years old, I witnessed my first public execution, but I thought my life in North Korea was normal. My family was not poor, and I never experienced hunger myself. But one day in 1995, my mother brought home a letter from her colleague's sister. It read, "By the time you read this letter, all five of us in my family will have passed away. We haven't had anything to eat for two weeks." "We are lying together on the floor now, our bodies too weak, ready to die." I was shocked to hear about what people living in my country were enduring. Soon after that, when I walked past a train station, I saw a very sad thing that I could never forget. A dying woman lay on the ground, holding a weak child in her arms, who could only look hopelessly at his mother's face. But no one helped them because everyone was unable to take care of their own family.In the mid-1990s, North Korea experienced a severe famine. Unfortunately, more than one million North Koreans died of starvation. Many survivors lived by eating grass, insects, and tree roots. Power outages also became more frequent, and at night everything around me became pitch black, except for the bright lights of China, just across the river next to my house. I often wondered why they had electricity while we did not. This is a satellite image comparing North Korea and neighboring countries at night. This is the Yalu River, which is part of the border between China and North Korea. As you can see, the river is very narrow in some places, narrow enough for North Koreans to sneak into China. But many who attempted to do so died. Sometimes I saw bodies floating on the surface of the water. I can't reveal too many details about when I left North Korea, but I can only say that it was the most difficult years during the famine, and I was sent to live with distant relatives in China. At the time, I thought I was only separated from my family for a short period of time. But I never imagined that it would take us 14 years to reunite. In China, I, as a homeless little girl, lived a very difficult life. I had no idea what my future would be like as a North Korean refugee. But I soon realized that life was not only full of hardships but also incredibly dangerous. Because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China, I always lived in fear that my identity would be discovered. I could be deported back to North Korea and face a tragic fate. One day, my worst nightmare came true, and I was caught by Chinese police and taken to a police station for questioning. Someone accused me of being North Korean, so the police tested my Chinese language ability and asked me many questions. I was very scared at the time and felt like my heart was going to explode from fear. If anything was off, I would be imprisoned and sent back, and I thought my life was over. Nevertheless, I tried my best to hide my fear and worries and answered their questions. Afterward, one police officer said to another, "The report is wrong; she is not North Korean." Then they let me go. It was truly a miracle. Some North Koreans go to foreign embassies in China seeking asylum, but many are caught by the Chinese police and sent back to North Korea. These girls were lucky. Although they were caught, under great international pressure, they were eventually released. But some North Koreans are not so lucky. Every year, countless North Koreans are arrested in China and deported. After returning to North Korea, they are tortured, imprisoned, or publicly executed. Although I was fortunate enough to leave North Korea, many of my compatriots were not so lucky. It is a tragic fact that North Koreans must live in hiding, going to such lengths just to survive. Even if they learn Chinese and find work, their entire world can be turned upside down in an instant. This is why, after ten years of hiding my identity, I decided to take the risk and go to South Korea. And so, I began a new life once again. Settling down in South Korea was even more difficult than I had imagined and full of challenges. English was too important in South Korea, so I had to start learning a third language - English. In addition, I realized that there were huge differences between South and North Korea. Although we are both Koreans, our inner selves have become very different due to the 67-year division. I even questioned my own identity. Am I South Korean or North Korean? Where do I come from? Who am I? Suddenly, I seemed unable to proudly call any country my own. Despite the difficulties of adapting to life in South Korea, I decided to prepare for the university entrance exam. Just as I was beginning to get used to my new life, I received a shocking phone call. The North Korean government had intercepted part of the money I had sent back home, and as punishment, my family was going to be forcibly relocated to a remote rural area. They had to escape quickly, so I began to plan to help them. The road to freedom for North Koreans is so elusive. Crossing the border between North Korea and South Korea is almost impossible, so ironically, I flew to China and then traveled to the Sino-Korean border. Since my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to help them cross over 2,000 kilometers in China and enter Southeast Asia. Our bus journey lasted a week, and we were almost caught several times. Once again, our bus was stopped, and a Chinese police officer boarded the bus, checking everyone's ID and asking questions. I was afraid that my family would be caught because they didn't speak Chinese, so when the Chinese police officer was about to check my family, I instinctively stood up and told him that they were deaf-mute and I was their guardian. He looked at me suspiciously, but fortunately, he believed me. That's how we made our way to Laos, but I had to spend almost all my savings to bribe the border police in Laos. And even though we got past that obstacle, my family was still arrested and jailed for illegal entry. After I paid the fine and the money used for bribes, my family was released a month later, but they were soon caught again in the capital of Laos. "That was one of the lowest points of my life. I did everything in my power to help my family gain their freedom, but just when we were close to success, they were imprisoned again, this time in a jail close to the North Korean embassy. I went back and forth between immigration and the police station, trying desperately to get them out, but I didn't have enough money to bribe or pay fines anymore. I was completely hopeless. Then, I heard someone ask me, 'What's wrong?' I was surprised that a complete stranger would ask me with such concern. Using my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation to him without hesitation. He went to the ATM and paid the remaining fees for my family and two other North Koreans to be released from prison. I sincerely thanked him and asked, 'Why did you help me?' 'I'm not helping you,' he replied." "I'm helping the North Korean people." I realized then that it was a symbolic moment in my life. That kind stranger symbolized the hope that both I and the North Korean people needed. He made me understand that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are the rays of hope that we North Koreans need. Eventually, after a long journey, my family and I reunited in South Korea. But gaining freedom was only half the battle won. Many North Koreans and their families are separated, and when they arrive in a new country, they often have very little money or nothing at all. Therefore, we can receive help from the international community in terms of education, English training, job training, and more. We can also serve as a bridge of communication between the world and those who live in North Korea because many of us are still in contact with our families living there. The messages and money we send back are quietly changing North Korea from within. I was so lucky to have received so much help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help those dreamers in North Korea to have the opportunity to realize their dreams with international aid. I am confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeed on the world stage, including on platforms like TED. Thank you.
I live in the south area of Los Angeles. This is what the south area of Los Angeles looks like: liquor stores, fast food restaurants, and vacant land. So the city planners sat together to discuss changing the name of the south area of Los Angeles to represent something else, as if this would solve the real problems of the city. So they changed it to South Los Angeles. This is South Los Angeles - liquor stores, fast food restaurants, and vacant land. Like 26.5 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, South Los Angeles, the home of drive-thrus and drive-bys. Interestingly, more people are killed by drive-thrus than drive-bys. People are dying from curable diseases. For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher, maybe eight times higher than in Beverly Hills, which is less than ten miles away. I'm tired of these realities. At the same time, I'm thinking, what does it feel like if there is no way to get healthy food? What does it feel like every time you leave your house and see the negative effects of the existing food system in your community? I see wheelchairs being traded like used cars. "I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks. I don't think we can keep going like this. I think the answer is hidden within the problem. Food is the problem, and food is also the solution. Plus, I'm tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to buy an apple that hasn't been sprayed with pesticides. So what I did was plant a food forest in front of my house. It's on the greenbelt we call Park Road. It's 150 feet by 10 feet in size. The greenbelt belongs to the government, but someone needs to maintain it." So I thought, "Great! This is my responsibility, I have to maintain it, so I can do whatever I want with it!" That's why I wanted to maintain it. So my team, "Los Angeles Green Grounds," and I gathered together and started planting our own food forest, fruit trees, and nine different vegetables. We are a free organization composed of gardeners from different industries and cities. Everyone is a volunteer, and everything we do is voluntary. The garden is very beautiful, but soon someone complained. The government accused me and gave me a ticket notifying me that I must remove my garden, and then the ticket turned into a warning letter. I thought, "What's going on? Is this for real? Prohibit planting food on a small piece of land that no one cared about before?" Then I thought, "Cool, that's it." Because nothing really happened. So the Los Angeles Times reported it, and Steve Lopez wrote a story about it and talked to a member of the legislature and a member of a green organization. They uploaded a petition to Change.org and collected 900 signatures, and we succeeded! We succeeded with our own hands. The legislator even came to visit and expressed how much he appreciated and loved what we did. I mean, of course, how could they not? Los Angeles has one of the largest amounts of open land in the United States. It has 26 square kilometers of open space. That's 20 Central Parks. There's enough space to plant 750 million tomatoes. Why do they think it's not good to do this? Planting one tree can receive a thousand or even ten thousand seeds. Planting one green bean for a dollar can bring you a return of 75 dollars. This is my creed, and I tell people to grow their own food. Growing your own food is like printing your own money. (Applause) Look, I have a legacy in Los Angeles. I grew up there, and I raised my son there. I refuse to be a part of this reality that is created for me by others. I want to create my own reality. You see, I am an artist. Gardening is my graffiti; I create my own art with it. Just like graffiti artists beautify walls, I beautify lawns and green belts. I treat the garden and the land as my canvas, and the plants and trees are my decorations on the canvas. You may be shocked by what land can do if you treat it as your canvas. You can't imagine how miraculous sunflowers are and what kind of impact they will have on people. What will happen? I witnessed my garden become a tool for education and for reforming my community. To change a community, you must change the composition of the soil. We are the soil. You will be shocked by how children are affected. Gardening is the most beneficial and challenging activity for physical health, especially in the city center. Plus, you can also harvest strawberries. I remember once a mother and daughter sneaked into my vegetable garden around 10:30 p.m. When I came out and saw them, they looked very embarrassed. Their appearance made me feel very bad, and I told them that they didn't have to come and get food like this. This is why the vegetable garden is on the street. When I see people around me hungry, it makes me feel very ashamed. This strengthens my determination to do (food forests). People ask me, "Fin, aren't you afraid that people will steal your food?" I replied, "Of course not, I am not afraid that people will steal it, and that is why it is on the street. This is exactly what I want. I want people to take it, but at the same time, I hope people can regain their healthy bodies." Another time, when I placed a garden in a homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles, these guys helped me unload the goods. It was cool, and they shared stories about how the garden affected them and how they planted with their mothers and grandmothers. Seeing the garden change them was a really cool thing, just for that moment. Green spaces organization has started placing maybe 20 gardens. We have about 50 people on our team, all of them volunteers. If kids grow kale, they eat kale. If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. But when it's not presented to them, if they're not taught how food affects their mind and body, they blindly eat whatever is put in front of them. I see young people who want to work, but they're willing to put in time on this. I see kids of different colors who are following along, going down a path that someone else has designed for them. And they're never going to reach the end of that path. When you teach a kid to garden and care for something, they're going to look for ways to make sure that thing thrives. When I'm gardening, I see an opportunity to train these kids to take over their communities and live sustainable lives. Who knows? We may have the next George Washington on our hands. But if we don't change the composition of the soil, we'll never know. That's my next plan. That's what I want to do. I want to plant a vegetable garden in an entire block where people can share food. I want to transform shipping containers into healthy cafes. Don't get me wrong. I'm not thinking about free, because free is not sustainable. And the funny thing about sustainability is that you have to maintain it. What I'm talking about is getting people jobs, getting kids off the streets, teaching them the joy, honor, and glory of growing their own food, and opening farmer's markets. So what I want to do is make this plan even more attractive. I want us to be the renegades of the environmental revolution, the rogues, the rogue gardeners. We want to rewrite the definition of rogue. If you're not a gardener, you're not a rogue. How about being a rogue with a shovel? Let the shovel be your weapon of choice. (applause) Basically, if you want to see me, if you want to meet up, if you want to sit in a comfortable chair and talk about this and that, don't call me. If you want to see me, bring a garden shovel and we can plant something together. That's it, thank you! Thank you.
(Hammering sound) (Microwave sound)You may agree that this road is quite good. It is made of asphalt, which is a very good material to drive on, but not always, especially on days like today when it's raining heavily. Water splashes up on the asphalt road, especially when you're riding a bike and passing by cars. At the same time, asphalt roads produce a lot of noise. This material is a bit noisy, and if we were to build a road close to the city, like the roads in the Netherlands, we would want the noise to be reduced. The solution is to use porous asphalt to build the road.Porous asphalt is a material used on most highways in the Netherlands. It has small pores that allow water to seep through, which makes it easier to drive on when it rains, and there is no splashing water. The noise also disappears in these pores. Because it has many holes, the noise is cancelled out by each other, making the road very quiet. Of course, it also has its disadvantages. The disadvantage of this kind of road is that the asphalt may come loose. What does that mean? Look at this road, the stones on the road surface are falling off. Starting with one stone, then a few more, and more and more, and then—I won't demonstrate it. But they can damage your windshield, and you definitely won't be happy. Finally, this kind of looseness will bring more and more damage. Sometimes there are potholes on the road surface. Ha, he was prepared for that. Potholes will certainly become a problem, but we have a solution. Here you can see the damage that appears on this material. This is asphalt, as I said, there is a small amount of adhesive in the middle of the stones. Due to weathering, UV rays, oxidation, and other reasons, this adhesive, this asphalt, the adhesive between the aggregate will shrink. If it shrinks, there will be small cracks, and layering will appear starting from the blocks. If you drive on this type of road, you will bring out these aggregates--that's what we see. To solve this problem, we have considered self-healing materials. If we can make this material self-healing, there may be a solution. What we use is steel wool used for cleaning kitchen utensils. Steel wool can be cut into very small pieces, and we mix these small pieces into the asphalt. So now the asphalt has some small steel wool in it. You also need a machine like this, an induction motor--it can be used to cook. Induction motors can heat things up, especially good at heating steel. So what we have to do is heat the steel, melt the asphalt, and the asphalt will flow into those small cracks, and the falling stones will be glued back on. Since the induction motor is too big to bring up, I demonstrated it here using a microwave oven, which works on a similar principle to the induction motor. I put the sample in, now take it out and see what happened. This is what the sample looks like now. We have industrial machines in our laboratory to heat the samples. We have tested many samples, and the government has seen our results, and they decided, "This is interesting, we should try it." The government has granted us a section of the highway for free, 400 meters on A58, and we did material testing there. This is what we did. What you see is the experimental section of the road we made, and of course this road will not break down in the coming years. We confirmed this in practice. We took many samples on this road section and did various tests in the laboratory. We conducted aging experiments, added a lot of loads, and used our induction motor to heat and test them repeatedly. We can repeat many times. In fact, the conclusion of this experiment is that if we use our heating machine - the extra-large microwave oven - on this road section every four years, we need to move this machine onto the highway - we will double the life of the road surface every four years, and of course, save a lot of money. So, the conclusion is that we have developed a material using steel fiber, added with steel fibers and using induction energy, which effectively increases the life of the road surface, doubling its lifespan. This simple technique will save a lot of money. You may be curious if it is effective. Let's take a look at this sample. It's still a bit hot now. In fact, I have to let it cool down first before showing you whether the heating repair is effective. But let's give it a try. Look, it really worked, it's fixed. Thank you!
When I was 11 years old, I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in our home. My father was using his small gray radio, smiling, which was rare because most news only made him upset. "The Taliban are gone!" my father exclaimed loudly. I didn't know what that meant, but I could tell my father was very, very happy. "Now you can go to a real school," he said. I will never forget that morning. A real school. When I was 6 years old, the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school. So for the next five years, I disguised myself as a boy and accompanied my sister to a secret school since my sister was not allowed to go out alone at that time. This is our only way of education. We had to take different routes every day so that no one would suspect where we were going. We put our books in grocery bags so that others would think we were just going shopping. The school was in a house, and more than 100 of us crammed into a small living room. It was comfortable in the winter but extremely hot in the summer. We all knew we were risking our lives - teachers, students, and parents were all aware. Sometimes, the school would suddenly close for a week because the Taliban suspected something. We were always worried that the Taliban would find us. Were we being followed? Did they know where we lived? We were very afraid, but we still wanted to go to school. I was lucky enough to grow up in a family that valued education and daughters. My grandfather was an extraordinary man in his time. He was from a remote area of Afghanistan and had different views from others. He insisted that his daughter, my mother, go to school and was subsequently cut off from his own father. But my educated mother became a teacher. That's her. She retired two years ago but turned our home into a school for girls and women in the community. My father - that's him - was the first person in his family to receive an education. So there was no doubt that his children should receive an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban and the risks. To him, not educating his children was an even greater risk. During the years when the Taliban controlled Afghanistan, I remember feeling frustrated with my life, always afraid and unable to see a future. I thought about giving up, but my father would say, "Listen, my daughter, you may lose anything in your life. Your money may be stolen, and you may be forced to leave your home because of war. But the only thing you can protect is yourself. If we have to sell blood to pay for your education, we will not hesitate. Do you still want to give up?"Now I am 22 years old. The country where I grew up has been destroyed by decades of war. Less than 6% of women my age have graduated from high school, and if it weren't for my family's insistence, I would be like the vast majority of people. And now, I am a proud graduate of Mindy College. When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the old man who was expelled from his family for insisting on educating his daughter, was the first to congratulate me. He was proud not only because of my university degree, but also because I was the first woman to drive him around the streets of Kabul. My family trusts me, and my dreams are big, but their expectations of me are even higher. That's why I became a global ambassador for "10x10," a global organization dedicated to female education. It's also why I participated in founding SOLA, the first and possibly the only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan, because in Afghanistan, educating girls is still very dangerous.What excites me is seeing students in my school seizing opportunities and having big aspirations. I see their parents, especially their fathers, supporting them like my father did, even though I can sense their fear in their faces. For example, Ahmed, which is not his real name, and I can't show you his face, is the father of one of my students. Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were almost killed by a roadside bomb on their way back to the village from school. When he arrived home, the phone rang, and a voice warned him that if he sent his daughter to school again, the same thing would happen again. "He said, 'If you want, you can kill me now. But I won't let your backward thinking ruin my daughter's future.' For Afghanistan, I realized - something that even Western countries had not realized - that behind our success was a father like this, who recognized the value of his daughter and understood that her success was his own success. This is not to say that mothers are not important to our success. In fact, they are usually the first and most persuasive negotiators for their daughters' bright futures, but in societies like Afghanistan, we must have male support. Under Taliban control, there were only a few hundred girls going to school - and it was illegal. But today, over three million girls in Afghanistan are receiving an education. Afghanistan is very different from the United States. I found that Americans could see the fragility of our changes. I worry about how long these changes can last after the withdrawal of American troops. But when I return to Afghanistan and see my students and the parents who support and encourage them, I see hope for the future, and I see that this change will continue." To me, Afghanistan is full of hope and endless possibilities, and every day the girls studying at SOLA remind me of this. Like me, they have big dreams too. Thank you.
I will not forget the words my grandmother said to me before she died in exile: "Child, resist Gaddafi and fight against him. But do not become a revolutionary like Gaddafi." It has been two years since the Libyan revolution broke out, inspired by the active participation of the people in the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt. I joined my fellow Libyans at home and abroad in calling for an "anger day" protest and starting a revolution against Gaddafi's dictatorship. This is a great revolutionary movement. Libyan young men and women stand at the forefront of the revolution, demanding the overthrow of the authoritarian government and shouting slogans of freedom, dignity, and social justice. They showed exemplary courage in their struggle against the brutal Gaddafi regime. They demonstrated a high level of unity, with people across the country coming together from east to west and south. Finally, after six months of brutal warfare that cost 50,000 lives, we overthrew the tyrannical rule and ushered in the country's freedom. However, Gaddafi left us with a heavy burden. He left behind the habits of dictatorship and corruption, and sowed the seeds of division. Gaddafi's 40-year dictatorship destroyed Libya's infrastructure, as well as its culture and moral values. I am well aware of the destruction caused by Gaddafi's dictatorship and the challenges we face. Together with many passionate women, I am trying to rebuild Libya's civil society. We call for the spirit of tolerance and justice to be reflected in Libya to achieve democracy and national reconciliation.At and after Gaddafi's downfall, nearly 200 organizations were established in Benghazi and nearly 300 were established in Tripoli. After 33 years in exile, I returned to Libya with extraordinary passion. I organized workshops to discuss capacity building and leadership development in human development. Along with a group of remarkable women, I founded the Libyan Women's Peace Platform. This is a movement of women from all walks of life and leaders. We fight for women's right to participate in social and political life and for our right to equal participation in democracy and peace building.Before the election, the situation in the country was very bad. The polarization between the two levels of government was increasingly severe because our politics were selfish and full of control and exclusion. I proposed an initiative at the Libyan Women's Peace Platform, calling for a more inclusive electoral law to be implemented in Libya. Every citizen of Libya, regardless of background, should have the right to vote and run for election. Most importantly, I called for political parties to specify that male and female candidates take turns at all levels, forming a cross-list of candidates.Ultimately, our initiative was adopted and successful. In the first election in 52 years in Libya, women won 17.5% of the seats in the National Assembly. However, little by little, the joy brought by the election and revolution disappeared in our country because every morning we see news about violent acts. One day we saw news of desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi saints' tombs. Another day we saw news of the murder of the US ambassador and attacks on the US consulate. And yet another day we saw news of the assassination of military officers. Moreover, every day we are under the rule of the national army, enduring their continuous violations of prisoners' human rights and their contempt for the rule of law. Our society is deeply influenced by the mentality of armed revolution, becoming increasingly divided and abandoning the ideals and principles we initially upheld, namely freedom, dignity, and social justice. Narrow-mindedness, exclusion, and revenge have become the hallmarks of our society after the revolution. Today, I am not here to inspire everyone with the success of the cross-candidate list and the elections. I am here to be honest. The decision we made to overthrow the Gaddafi government was wrong, and we did not grasp the key issues. Because the elections did not bring peace and stability to Libya. Did the cross-candidate list we advocated bring peace and reconciliation between ethnic groups to Libya? No, it did not.So what is the key issue? Why is our society still deeply divided? Why is our politics still full of control and exclusion, even with the participation of both men and women? Perhaps we need not only women, but also women's values ​​- compassion, mercy, and inclusiveness. Our society needs a national dialogue to establish national consensus, which is more important for our society than elections, as elections only exacerbate division and fragmentation. Our society needs representatives with feminine traits, which is more important for our society than female representation in numbers. We need to stop our angry actions and stop calling for "Anger Day" marches. We need to start showing sympathy and mercy. We need feminine language that respects and implements sympathy, cooperation, and inclusiveness, abandoning revenge, competition, and narrow-mindedness. This is the urgent goal that war-torn Libya needs to strive for peace. Because peace has a unique way of being forged, it requires a close connection and constant interchange between the perspectives of both men and women. This is what true intersectionality means. And we need to establish this male-female intersectionality before we can operate in social and political life. A verse in the Quran says, "Salam," meaning peace, "comes from our most merciful Lord, Raheem." And in the traditions of all Abrahamic religions, the word "raheem," which is well-known, is derived from "rahem" in Arabic, which symbolizes the feminine nurturing and all-encompassing quality of motherhood that encompasses all humanity, men and women, as well as all tribes and nations that come from her. Just as the womb completely envelops the embryo growing within it, the divine, compassionate motherhood nurtures all things in the world. Therefore, the teachings we receive tell us, "My mercy encompasses all things." And the teachings we receive tell us, "My mercy overcomes my anger." May we all be blessed with mercy. Thank you.
Today, I want to talk about a disturbing issue, one whose answer is equally vexing. I want to discuss the secret of domestic violence, and the question I will answer is one that everyone has asked at some point: "Why did she stay?" "How could someone choose to stay with a man who beats her?" I am not a psychiatrist, social worker, or an expert on domestic violence. I am simply a woman with a personal story to share. At the time, I was 22 years old and had just graduated from Harvard. I had moved to New York City and started my first job as an editor and writer at Seventeen magazine. I had my own apartment for the first time, my first credit card, and a very big secret. The secret was that I had been held at gunpoint, too many times to remember, by a man I believed to be my soulmate. This man, whom I had loved deeply, pointed a gun at my head and threatened to kill me, and I can't recall how many times he did this. The story of this "crazy love" I am telling now is a psychological trap disguised as love, and every year millions of women, and even some men, fall into this trap. Maybe it's happening to you. I don't look like a typical domestic violence victim. I have an English degree from Harvard and an MBA in marketing from the Wharton School. I spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burnett, and The Washington Post. I've been married to my second husband for almost 20 years and have three children. I have a black Labrador Retriever and drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. Here's the first fact I want to tell you: domestic violence can happen to anyone, regardless of race, faith, income, or education level. It's everywhere. The second fact I want to share is that many people believe that since domestic violence happens to women, it must be the woman's problem. No, that's not true. More than 85% of abusers are men, and domestic violence only occurs in intimate, mutually dependent, long-term relationships, in other words, in the home, which is the last place we want or expect to see violence. This is one of the reasons why domestic violence is so disturbing. I thought I was the only one in the world who would continue to stay with a man who hit me, but the truth is that it's very common for someone my age. I was 22 at the time. In the United States, women between the ages of 16 and 24 are more than twice as likely to be victims of domestic violence as women of other ages. Also, in the United States, more than 500 women or girls are killed by their abusers every year, their boyfriends or husbands. I was a very typical victim and had no idea about the warning signs and patterns of domestic violence. I met Connor on a rainy night in January when it was very cold. We happened to sit together on the subway in New York City, and he struck up a conversation with me. He told me two things. The first was that he also graduated from an Ivy League school and worked at a very good Wall Street bank. But what impressed me most about our first meeting was his intelligence and sense of humor, although he looked like a farm boy. His cheeks were as red as big apples, with wheat-colored golden hair, looking very likable. The smartest thing Connor did in the early stages of our relationship was to make me believe that I was the dominant one in this relationship. Especially in the beginning, he made me feel like I was his idol. We started dating, and he liked everything about me, such as my intelligence, my Harvard experience, my passionate help for teenage girls, and my job. He was eager to know about my family, my childhood, my wishes, and dreams. The degree of trust Connor had in me, as a woman and a writer, was something I had never experienced from anyone else before. By revealing his unknown secrets, he created a unique atmosphere of mutual trust between us. He told me that his stepfather had been brutally physically abusing him since he was four years old. The abuse was so bad that he had to drop out of school in eighth grade, even though he was very smart at the time. It took him almost 20 years to rebuild his life. This is why his Ivy League degree, Wall Street job, and bright future mean so much to him. If someone had told me at the time that this smart, humorous, considerate, and loving man would one day command me to wear makeup, wear shorter skirts, live where, do what work, who to be friends with, and where to spend Christmas, I would have laughed at you because I couldn't see any signs of violence, control, or anger in Connor. At the time, I didn't know that seduction and deception were part of a domestic violence relationship. The first step was something I didn't even realize at the time. The second step was isolating the victim. Connor didn't come home and announce, "Hey, as great as the romantic stuff is, we need to move on to the next phase where I isolate and abuse you." "So I need you to leave your apartment, to keep your neighbors from hearing you scream, and I need you to leave this city where you have friends, family, and coworkers, or they will see your injuries." In reality, one Friday night, Connor came home and told me he had quit his job, his dream job, because of me. I gave him so much happiness and security that he no longer needed to prove himself on Wall Street. Now he just wanted to leave this city and the abusive, dysfunctional family behind and move to a small town in New England to start a new life with me. At the time, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York City and my beloved job, but for my soulmate, I felt I needed to make sacrifices. So I agreed and quit my job, and together with Connor, we left Manhattan. I thought I had fallen into crazy love and didn't yet know that I had stumbled into a carefully woven trap that would control my body, mind, and finances. The third phase of the domestic violence cycle is to start using violence as a threat and observe her reaction. That's what the gun was for just now. We had just moved to a small town in New England - I think Connor must have thought it was safe here - and he bought three guns. One was in the glove compartment of the car. One was under the pillow on the bed, and the third was always in his pocket. He said the childhood psychological trauma made him need these guns to feel safe. Those guns were a clear signal to me, even though he didn't pick up the gun and point it at me, I was always on the edge of danger. The first time Connor hit me was five days before our wedding. It was seven o'clock in the morning, and I was still in my pajamas. I was working on the computer, trying to complete a freelance writing task, and I was a little impatient. Connor used my anger as an excuse to put his hands around my neck, squeezing tightly, making it impossible for me to breathe or scream. He grabbed my neck from behind and slammed my head against the wall over and over again. Five days later, when the ten finger marks on my neck had just faded, I put on my mother's wedding dress and married him. Despite what happened, I still believed we could live a happy life together because we loved each other so much, and because he showed deep remorse. He just had too much pressure. Preparing for the wedding and the arrival of my family members made him feel suffocated. It was an accident, and he won't hurt me again. During our honeymoon, I was beaten twice. The first time, I drove to find a secret beach but got lost. He (sitting in the passenger seat) kept hitting my head so hard that my head kept hitting the glass of the driver's seat door. A few days later, on our way back home from the honeymoon, we got stuck in traffic, which made him very agitated, and he smashed a cold Whopper on my face. In our two and a half years of marriage, I was beaten once or twice a week. I used to think that I was the only one who had such an experience. In fact, one in every three American women is a domestic violence victim or potential target, and CDC reports that 15 million children are abused each year, 15 million. So, in fact, I am not an exception.Now back to my question: Why did I stay? The answer is simple. I didn't know he was abusing me. Despite holding a loaded gun to my head, pushing me down the stairs, threatening to kill our dog, pulling the keys out of the car on the freeway, and dumping coffee grounds on my head while I was preparing for a job interview, I never thought of myself as an abused wife. Quite the opposite, I was a strong woman who loved this troubled man, and I was the only person in the world who could help Connor face his demons. Another question that everyone wants to ask is why didn't she leave? Why didn't I run away? I had many opportunities. For me, this is the most heartbreaking and painful question people ask, but you cannot understand how dangerous it is to leave an abuser, only we victims know. Because the last step in domestic violence is to kill her. Over 70% of domestic violence murders occur after the victim has ended the relationship, after she has left, because the abuser no longer has any restraint. Other possible outcomes include long-term stalking, even after the abuser remarries (he will still stalk); refusal to provide financial support; and deception of the family court to intimidate the victim and her children. Children are often required by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother. Now we still ask, why didn't she run away? The reason I decided to leave was because the last brutal beating exceeded my limits. I realized that if I didn't resist, the man I once deeply loved would kill me. So I broke the silence. I asked everyone for help: the police, neighbors, my friends and family, complete strangers. I stand here today because each and every one of you helped me. We tend to describe victims as the terrible headlines in the news. "Why did she stay?" Some people actually mean, "It's her own fault," as if the victim intentionally and deliberately loved the man who abused her. But after the publication of "Crazy Love," many men and women told me their stories and wanted to tell others what they learned from what happened, and they started their lives again-happy lives-as employees, wives, and mothers, living like I am now, far away from violence. In fact, I am a typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor. I remarried a kind and gentle man and we have three children. I have a black Labrador retriever and drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. What I will never have again is a gun pointed at my head by someone who said he loved me. At this moment, you may be thinking, "Wow, this is amazing," or "Oh, she's really stupid," but in fact, I'm talking about you. I can guarantee that among those listening to me now, some are suffering from abuse, or have been abused as children, or you are the abuser. Abuse may be happening to your daughter, your sister, your best friend. I was able to end my "crazy love" story by breaking the silence. Today, I am still breaking the silence. This is how I help other victims and also my final request to you. Tell someone what you have heard today. Abuse can only thrive in silence. You have the power to stop domestic violence by lighting a spark. We victims need everyone's help. We need each and every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence. Discuss this topic with your children, your colleagues, your friends, and your family. Shine a light on abuse, help survivors rediscover their beautiful, lovable selves, and regain their future. Identify the signs of domestic violence and intervene seriously to reduce the likelihood of its occurrence, and provide a safe way out for victims. Let's join hands and make our beds, our tables, and our homes the safe and peaceful oasis they should be. Thank you.
Hi, I'm Cameron Russell. For the past little while, I've been a model. Actually, for 10 years. Now, I feel a discomforting nervousness in this room because I shouldn't have worn this dress. Luckily, I brought another outfit. This is the first time for a live TED wardrobe change, so I guess you're all lucky today. If some ladies are scared of what I'm wearing, don't tell me right now, I'll find out on Twitter soon enough. I also want to tell you that I'm lucky enough to be able to change my image in your mind in just 10 seconds. Not everyone can do that. These high heels are uncomfortable, and the good news is I don't plan on wearing them. The bad news is I have to tuck this sweater into my underwear because then you'll laugh at me. So, don't do anything while I change, okay? So, why am I doing this? It's weird. Um, hopefully not as weird as that photo. Images are powerful, but also surface-level. I just completely changed my image in your mind in six seconds. In this picture, I actually didn't have a boyfriend in real life. When the photographer asked me to arch my back and touch that guy's hair, I was very uncomfortable. The truth is, besides surgery or like I did two days ago, dyeing my hair brown for a job, we can't really change our looks. Our appearance, although superficial and fixed, still greatly affects our lives. So, for me today, being fearless means being honest. And I'm here today because I am a model. I am on this stage because I am a beautiful white female. In our industry, we call this a "sexy girl." I want to answer some of the questions people often ask me in an honest way. The first question is, how did you become a model? I always say, "I was discovered," but that doesn't really explain anything. The real reason I became a model is that I have excellent genes, I am the recipient of a legacy. You may be wondering what that legacy is. Well, for the past few centuries, our definition of beauty has not only included the elements we naturally admire, such as health, youth, and a symmetrical figure, but also tall, slim figures, a feminine air, and white skin. This is my legacy, and it is what I have been fulfilling. I know some of you may question this view. You may cite fashion figures like Naomi, Tyra, Joan Smalls, and Liu Wen. First of all, I want to commend your impressive understanding of the modeling industry. Unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a doctoral student at New York University calculated the number of employed models and found that out of 677 officially employed models, only 27, or less than four percent, were non-white. The next question people often ask me is, "Can I become a model when I grow up?" My first answer is, "I don't know because they didn't put me in charge of that." But my second answer, and this is what I want to say to the little girls who ask me, is "Why?" You know, you can be anything you want to be. You could be the President of the United States or the inventor of the next Internet or a ninja poet surgeon, which would be awesome because you would be the first one. If after all this, they still say, "No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model," I say, "Well, then you have to be my boss," because I cannot say anything. You could be the editor-in-chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H&M or the next Steven Meisel. Saying you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying you want to win the Powerball. It's not something you can control. Modeling is great, but it's not a career you can plan. I'm going to share some of my experiences from my 10 years in the industry with you all, because unlike being a ninja poet surgeon, it's all about being in the moment. So if the photographer is here, the light is here, like a beautiful mercury light, and the client says, "Cameron, I want a walking shot," you take that long leg, you put it in front, you take that hand, you put it back, you take that other hand and put it on your hip, and you look at your friend in your head and say, "Hey, this could be us." 300, 400, 500 times. It looks like this. I hope it's not as weird as the one in the middle. I don't know what happened with that one. The reality is that once you graduate and have a resume and a few jobs under your belt, you can't say anything else. So if you say you want to be the President of the United States, but your resume says you have ten years of experience as an underwear model, people will laugh at you. The next question people often ask is, "Do they edit the photos?" Yes, they edit almost all photos, but it's only a small part of the job. This is my first model photo and also the first time I wore a bikini. I hadn't even started my period yet. I know this is a bit personal, but I was young at the time. This photo was taken a few months ago with my grandmother. This is the day of the photo shoot. My friend was with me. This is a photo of me at a lingerie party a few days before I shot for French Vogue. This is a photo of me with the soccer team and V magazine. This is me now. What I want you to understand is that these are not my own photos. They are images created by a group of professionals: hairstylists, makeup artists, photographers, stylists, their assistants, pre-production, and post-production. They created these images, not me.The next question is, "Can you get free stuff?" I do have too much of it, 8-inch high heels I've never had a chance to wear. But the free stuff is what I get in real life, and that's something we don't want to talk about. I grew up in Cambridge. One time I walked into a store without my wallet, and they gave me a dress. When I was in my teens, my friend and I drove together. She was a terrible driver and ran a red light. We got pulled over, and I just said, "Sorry, officer," and we continued on our way.I got these things because of my appearance, not because of my status. Some people pay a price for their appearance, not their status. I live in New York. Last year, 140,000 young people were stopped and frisked. 86% of them were Black or Latino. Most were young boys. But in New York City, there are only 177,000 young Black and Latino men. So for them, the question isn't "Will I be stopped?" but "How many times will I be stopped? When will I be stopped?"When I was researching for this speech, I found that 53% of 13-year-old American girls don't like their bodies. By the time they're 17, that number goes up to 78%.So the last question is, "What's it like to be a model?" I guess they expect me to say, "It's really glamorous and I feel very lucky." And that's partially true. But it's not the whole truth. The reality is, I never say what I really feel. And I never say what I really think. I never say, "I'm insecure." I have to worry every day about how I look. If you ever wondered, "Would I be happier if my thighs were thinner and my hair was better?" Just look at the models, because they have the thinnest thighs, the prettiest hair, and the coolest clothes, and they still might be the most physically insecure women in the world. So as I prepared for this speech, it was difficult to find a balance of being truthful. On one hand, if I stand up here and say, "Look, I've been given so much because of my natural advantages," that doesn't feel good. But if I follow that up with, "But none of it makes me happy," that's also uncomfortable. But the hardest part is demonstrating the occupational traditions of gender and racial discrimination because I, myself, am the biggest beneficiary. But at the same time, I'm happy and respected standing here while the industry is putting up more and more barriers between me and the direct experience. Because by the time I'm 10, 20, or 30 years into my career, I might not talk about how I got my first job or how I paid for college, which seems so important now. If this speech can do anything, I hope it can inspire us all to embrace the power of imagery to define our own versions of success and our own versions of happiness. Thank you.
Since I was old enough to pick up a camera, I have been passionate about photography, but today I want to share with you 15 of my most cherished photos, none of which were taken by me. There was no art direction, no stylist, no retakes, and certainly no lighting. In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists we found.My story begins with an invitation to speak in New York City. My wife took a photo of me holding our daughter on her first birthday, standing at the corner of 57th and 5th Avenue. A year later, we found ourselves back in New York and decided to take the same photo. You can guess how it developed from there. Approaching our daughter's third birthday, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York for a father-daughter trip and continue this little tradition?" And that's when we started asking tourists we met on the street to take our photo.You know how uncommon and yet common it is to hand a camera to a complete stranger to take a photo. No one refused, and luckily, no one ran off with our camera. At that time, we didn't know that such a journey would deeply change our lives. For us, it gradually became sacred. This photo was taken a few weeks after 9/11. At that time, I was trying to explain to my five-year-old daughter what had happened on that day, trying to find a way to make her understand. So these photos are far more than just recording a moment, or a special journey. They are a way for us to preserve time, to remember a certain week in October, to reminisce about how we have changed year after year, not just physically, but in all aspects. Because every year, we take the same photos, but our perspectives are different. My daughter reaches new milestones, and I look at life through her eyes, see how she reacts and how she sees everything. This is our time together as parent and child, the most cherished and anticipated time of the year. On our most recent trip, we were walking down the street when she suddenly stopped. She pointed to a red awning of a toy store and said she loved that awning when she was little, starting from one of our previous trips. She described to me how she felt when she stood at the photo spot at the age of five. She said she remembers her heart almost jumping out of her chest when she first saw that place, which was nine years ago. ow she is focused on college campuses in New York because she has decided to go to school there. Suddenly, I understand: one of the most important things we create is our memories. So I want to share the idea of actively and consciously creating memories. I don't know about your situation, but personally, besides these 15 photos, I don't often appear in family photos. I'm always the one taking pictures. I hope to encourage everyone here today to get into the photos, don't hesitate, go up to strangers and ask, "Can you take a photo for us?" Thank you.
I want to talk to you about a very unusual animal. There are a total of ten thousand bird species on Earth. Vultures are the most endangered species among them. Whenever you see a vulture like this one, the first thing that comes to your mind is probably that it is a disgusting, insatiable, and flesh-eating creature that makes you think of politicians. I want to change this perception. I want to change the bad associations people have with vultures because they need our sympathy. They really do. Let me tell you why.First of all, why do they give us this bad impression? In 1832, Charles Darwin, during his journey across the Atlantic on the Beagle, discovered the Turkish vulture and said, "These disgusting birds with their crimson heads are always indulging in rotten flesh." It's hard to find a more vicious insult than that, and it was said by Charles Darwin himself. Do you know that Darwin changed his mind after returning to England? I'll tell you why in a moment. Vultures have also been picked up by Disney - anthropomorphized like Up's Dug, becoming a numb, stupid animated character. And recently, if you've been paying attention to the news in Kenya - (cheers) - Kenya's parliamentarians have been ridiculed as greedy and stupid like vultures. But I want to challenge it. I question it. Do you know why? Because parliamentarians cannot keep the natural environment clean. They cannot prevent the spread of disease. Almost no one adheres to the monogamous system. They are far from extinction. And, my favorite, vultures are much more attractive than politicians. There are two types of vultures in the world. New World vultures are mainly found in the Americas, such as the American vulture and the Venezuelan vulture, while on other continents, there are a total of 16 species of vultures, 11 of which are facing extinction.So why are vultures important? First of all, vultures play a crucial role in the ecological cycle. They clean the environment. Vultures are our natural garbage collectors. They eat all the flesh off the corpse, leaving only bones. They can eliminate all the bacteria on the body, absorb anthrax viruses, and stop the spread and spread of the virus, thus keeping a large number of livestock and animals away from death and disease. Recent studies have also shown that in areas where vultures do not exist, the decomposition of corpses takes three to four times longer, providing more opportunities for disease spread and spread.Vultures also have a lot of historical significance. They are closely related to ancient Egyptian culture. The goddess Nekhbet symbolizes guardianship and motherhood in ancient Egyptian culture. She usually appears with the goddess Wadjet, symbolizing the unity and unity of Upper and Lower Egypt. In Hindu mythology, the god of vultures is named Jatayu, who risked his life to rescue the goddess Sita from the hands of the ten-headed demon Ravana. In Tibetan culture, vultures are especially important for sky burial. In places similar to Tibet, where there are no conditions for burial or wood for cremation, vultures provide a natural corpse disposal system for local people. What problems do vultures face? Kenya is home to eight species of vultures, six of which are critically endangered. Many vultures are poisoned due to the ongoing competition for living space between humans and wildlife in Kenya. Herders use poison to deal with predatory animals, and after they are poisoned, vultures become the next victims. In South Asia, some countries, such as India and Pakistan, have listed four vulture species as critically endangered, which means they will be completely extinct within 10 to 15 years. The reason for their extinction is that vultures feed on livestock that have been fed with diclofenac-containing painkillers before their death. Now, animal medicines containing diclofenac have been banned in India, and the Indian government has shown a positive attitude. Due to the sudden decrease in the number of vultures, wild dogs have begun to proliferate around livestock burial sites. In areas where wild dogs are rampant, rabies can erupt like a time bomb at any time. The number of rabies cases in India has increased dramatically. Kenya is about to have the largest wind power plant in Africa: 353 turbines will be installed in the Lake Turkana area. I do not oppose the development of wind energy, but we should urge the government to reconsider this decision because wind turbines pose a threat to birds. The high-speed blades can "cut" birds in half. They are like bird shredders. In West Africa, some people callously sell dead vultures to meet the demands of witchcraft and collections. What are we doing? We are studying these vultures. We are installing trackers on them to try and understand their relationship with the surrounding environment and their movements. We found out that they travel between different countries, so if you just focus on one area, you may not make much progress. We need to work with governments across the region. We are working hard to communicate with local residents, to make them aware of the benefits of vultures and to appreciate the contributions these wonderful creatures make to nature. What can you do? You can take action and raise awareness. You can write to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these misunderstood creatures. Take the time to tell as many people as possible around you. When you leave this room, you will become a vulture expert. Tell your family and neighbors stories about vultures. They are so elegant. Charles Darwin once said that he changed his view when he saw the vultures' graceful and natural figure in the sky. Kenya, and the world, will suffer great loss if we lose these amazing species. Thank you very much. (Applause)
Everything I have done, whether in my personal life or my professional life, has been deeply influenced by the seven years I spent working in Africa as a young person, from 1971 to 1977. I may look young, but I am old -- I have been involved in numerous technical cooperation projects with various African countries, including Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, and Somalia. At the time, I was working for an Italian non-governmental organization. Every project we established in Africa failed. I was going crazy. At the age of 21, I thought we Italians were good people, working for the benefit of Africa. However, we got what we deserved. Our first project inspired me to write my first book, called "Ripples on the Zambezi River." In this project, we Italians decided to teach Zambians how to grow food. So we brought Italian seeds to southern Zambia, a magnificent and charming valley leading to the Zambezi River. We taught the locals to grow Italian tomatoes, zucchini, and so on. Of course, the locals showed no interest, so we paid them to work, and they came and went as they pleased. With such a fertile valley, we were surprised that the locals didn't farm. But we didn't ask why, we just exclaimed, "Thank goodness we're here." "We're reaching out to help starving Zambian people." Of course, everything grows very well in Africa. The tomatoes we planted were gorgeous. In Italy, a tomato is this big, but in Zambia, they grow this big. It's unbelievable. We told the Zambians, "Look, farming is so easy." When the tomatoes ripened and turned a beautiful red color, overnight, more than two hundred hippos came from the Zambezi River and ate all the tomatoes. We said to the Zambians, "Oh my god, these damn hippos!" The Zambians said, "Exactly, that's why we don't farm here." "Why didn't you tell us earlier?" "You didn't ask." I thought only the Italians failed in Africa, but when I learned about the Americans, the British, the French, and what they did, I felt very proud of our project in Zambia. At least we fed the hippos. You should see this garbage--you should see how much garbage we have given to these trusting African people. You can read this book called "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, a Zambian economist. The book was published in 2009. We Western aid countries have invested two trillion dollars in the African continent in the past fifty years. I don't intend to go into detail about the damage this money has caused. You can read about it yourself. See how much harm we have brought from the perspective of an African woman. We Westerners are imperialists, colonizers, and missionaries, and we only deal with people in two ways: by condescension or as parents. These two words come from the Latin root "pater," which means "father." But the meanings of the two words are different. Parenting means treating people with different cultural backgrounds as my children. "I love you, my child." Condescension means treating people from another cultural background as my servants. That's why white people are called "bosses" in Africa. When I was reading a book, I felt like I was struck by a blow. This book is called "Small is Beautiful" and the author is Schumacher. He says that the most important aspect of economic development is to let people be, if they don't want help, let them be. This should be the primary principle of aid. The primary principle of aid is respect. This morning, the gentleman who gave the opening speech for this conference placed a stick on the ground and said, "Can you--can you imagine a city that has not been invaded by neo-colonialism?" When I was 27 years old, I made a decision to provide assistance based solely on people's needs. I created a working system called "Enterprise Dream Factory". We do not act as founders, nor do we incentivize anyone. Instead, we serve the local people's entrepreneurial passion and help them find a better life orientation. So what we have to do--is shut up. When we enter a community, we don't impose any ideas on others, but sit down and communicate with the locals. Our workplace is not in the office. We meet with clients in restaurants and bars. We don't have any infrastructure construction. What we do is make friends with them and discover their interests and intentions. The most important thing is enthusiasm. You can propose your ideas to customers, but what can you do if they are not interested? The customer's enthusiasm for self-improvement is the most important thing. Their enthusiasm is built on the foundation of self-improvement, and this is the most important thing. Then we help them collect relevant knowledge and information, because a single thread cannot make a cord, and a single tree cannot make a forest. People with ideas may not understand relevant knowledge, but we can provide support. So many years ago, I had an idea. Why can't we listen to their ideas at least once, instead of imposing our own ideas on them? But this cannot be done in the form of a community meeting. Let me tell you a secret. There is a problem with community meetings. Entrepreneurs never attend, and they will never tell you at public gatherings where they plan to spend money or what business opportunities they see. Therefore, there is a blind spot in planning, and you may not even have the opportunity to meet the smartest people in the community because they simply do not participate in your public gatherings. Our approach is to work one-on-one with clients. To do this, we must build an unprecedented social infrastructure. We must create a completely new profession. This profession is equivalent to a family doctor for enterprises. The enterprise family doctor will face you one-on-one in your home, your kitchen table, or a coffee shop, helping you to mobilize resources to turn your entrepreneurial enthusiasm into livelihood skills. I conducted an experiment in Esperance, Western Australia. At the time, I was doing my PhD and trying to avoid that condescending nonsense that only involves bossing people around when you arrive. In my first year in Esperance, I just went out for a walk. During those days, I I got these five fishermen to work together, not selling delicious tuna at a low price of 60 cents per kilogram to Albany's canned food factory, but selling it to Japan for sushi at a high price of $15 per kilogram. Then there were farmers who came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them, can you help us?" Within a year, I did 27 projects. Government officials came to me and asked, "How did you do it? How can you--?" I said, "I did a difficult thing, which is to shut up and listen to them." So-- so the government people said, "Then keep doing it." We have launched this project in 300 communities around the world. We have helped establish 40,000 businesses. The next generation of entrepreneurs will accomplish nothing by working behind closed doors. Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history, died a few years ago at the age of 96. Before venturing into the business world, Peter Drucker was a philosophy professor. Peter Drucker once said, "Planning is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and a entrepreneurial economy." Planning is counterproductive for entrepreneurship. Now we are rebuilding Christchurch, but we don't know how the smartest people in Christchurch want to use their own money and energy. We must learn how to get these people to give their opinions. We must give them a promise of confidentiality and respect their privacy. We need to be good at providing them with assistance, so that they will come to us and be numerous. In a community of 10,000 people, we have 200 clients. Can you imagine how much intelligence and enthusiasm a community of 400,000 people can bring together? The most applauded speech this morning came from a local person full of entrepreneurial enthusiasm. So what I want to say is that the entrepreneurial spirit is the trend of today's society. When we were at the end of the first industrial revolution, we used non-renewable mineral fuels to develop manufacturing, but we suddenly realized that this kind of development is unsustainable. There will be a day when the fuel for the internal combustion engine runs out. Using CFCs to refrigerate food is also not a long-term solution. What we need to focus on now is how to meet the food, medical, education, transportation, and communication needs of 7 billion people in a sustainable way. The existing level of technology cannot achieve this. Who can invent the technology to achieve a green revolution? Universities? Don't count on it! Governments? Don't count on it! It's entrepreneurs, they are the ones fighting for it. Many years ago, I read an interesting article in a futurist magazine. In 1860, a group of experts were invited to discuss what the future of New York City would be like. It was 1860, and these people gathered together to make predictions about New York City 100 years later. Their conclusion was unanimous: New York City would no longer exist in 100 years. Why? Because they looked at the curve on a graph and said that if the population continued to grow at this rate, New Yorkers would need six million horses to travel, and the horse manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to handle. People would be inundated with horse manure. So in 1860, they believed that this dirty technology would strangle the life out of New York City. So what was the result? 40 years later, in 1900, the United States had 1,001 automobile manufacturers - as many as 1,001. Finding a new technology to replace the old is the key to development, but there are still many small factories that are stagnant. For example, the Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan. However, there is a secret to dealing with entrepreneurs. First, you need to give them a promise of confidentiality. Otherwise, they won't come to talk to you. Then you need to provide them with dedicated and enthusiastic service. You need to tell them the true essence of the entrepreneurial spirit. Whether it's a big company or a small business, you can do three things well: have excellent product quality, efficient marketing, and smart financial management. What is the problem then? No one in the world can excel in production, sales, and finance at the same time. Such a person does not exist. There are no superhumans like that yet. We conducted a survey and studied 100 benchmark companies in the world, including the Carnegie Training Company, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, General Electric, Ford Motor Company, and all these emerging companies such as Google and Yahoo. The only thing that all successful companies in the world have in common is that not a single company was created by one person alone.Now we teach 16-year-olds entrepreneurship in Northumberland County. We started by showing them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography. Their task is to underline and count how many times the word "I" and how many times the word "we" is used in Richard Branson's first two pages of his autobiography. "I" is not used at all, and "we" is used 32 times. When he started, he was not alone. No one can establish a business alone. No one. So we can build a community where we have support from auxiliary merchants with a background in small businesses in cafes and bars to give you advice. We can provide you with the help this ambitious gentleman received, and we will ask you, "What do you need?" What can you do? Can you produce it? Can you sell it? Can you manage finances? "Oh, I can't do that." "Shall I help you find someone to help?" We encourage entrepreneurship in various communities. We have a volunteer team to assist entrepreneurs in assembling resources and manpower for clients. We found that the wisdom of the local people can create miracles and change the culture and economy of the community, as long as you can make good use of people's enthusiasm, vitality, and imagination. Thank you.
Our surrounding community can help us in many ways to make our lives better. We may not always come into contact with our neighbors, so even if we live in the same public space, their wisdom can be difficult to pass on. Therefore, over the past few years, I have tried different ways, such as using stickers, posters, and chalk, to share more things with my neighbors in public spaces. These projects originated from some of my own questions, such as how much rent my neighbors have to pay, how we can borrow more things from each other without knocking on each other's doors at inappropriate times, how we can better share memories of abandoned buildings, and better understand the land we live on. How can we better express our expectations for vacant storefronts so that our community can reflect our current needs and dreams?I currently live in New Orleans and have fallen in love with this city. The evergreen giant oak trees always soothe my soul. For hundreds of years, lovers, drunkards, and dreamers have always rested under the trees. I firmly believe that this city, full of musical rhythm, feels like a parade every time someone sneezes. New Orleans has some of the world's most beautiful architecture, but at the same time, it is also the city with the most abandoned buildings in the United States. I live near this house, and I have been thinking about how to make it a better place in this community. I also thought about something else that completely changed my life. In 2009, I lost someone very dear to me. Her name was Joan, and to me, she was like a mother. Her death was sudden, and no one expected it. Then, I started thinking a lot about death and⋯⋯ It made me appreciate the time I have and showed me what really matters in my life. But I found it hard to maintain this mindset in my daily life. I feel that people are too easily trapped by the trivialities of day-to-day life and forget what is truly important. So, with the help of some new and old friends, I turned one side of this abandoned house into a giant blackboard. I filled it with the same fill-in-the-blank question, "Before I die, I want to⋯⋯" So every person who passes by can pick up a piece of chalk and leave a trace of their lives in public places, to share their innermost desires. I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but the next day, the entire wall was filled, and people kept adding new answers. I want to share with you some of the things people wrote on that wall: "Before I die, I want to be judged for my pirate behavior." "Before I die, I want to cross the international date line." "Before I die, I want to sing in front of millions of people." "Before I die, I want to plant a tree." "Before I die, I want to live a secluded life." "Before I die, I want to hug her one more time." "Before I die, I want to be someone's knight." "Before I die, I want to be completely true to myself." This once-forgotten building has become an incredibly constructive place. The hopes and dreams of these people make me laugh out loud and cry in sadness. They have given me comfort in times of hardship. This makes us believe that we are not alone and gives us a new, enlightening understanding of our neighbors. It creates a space for reflection and thought and reminds us of what is truly important in the ever-changing process of growth and change. This blackboard was created by me last year, and I kept receiving messages from passionate people saying that they wanted to create a similar wall in their own community. So, my colleagues and I created a small toolbox, and now, this wall has spread all over the world, including places like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, and Argentina. These signs show that if we have an opportunity to express ourselves and share with others, public space can play a huge role. We have two of the most valuable things: time and connection with others. In this age of materialism, it is more important than ever to strive to maintain our sense of self and remember the brevity of life and the fragility of existence. We are always too afraid to talk about death, and even more afraid to think about it. But I realized that preparing ourselves for death is one of the most powerful things we can do. Thinking about death can give us a clearer understanding of our own lives. Public space can better reflect what is truly important to us, both individually and as a community. With more ways to share our hopes, fears, and experiences, the people around us can not only help us create a better place but also help us live a better life. You're welcome!
Today, I only ask for one thing - don't call me a normal person. I want to introduce you to my two brothers. Remi is 22 years old, tall and handsome. He doesn't talk much, but he can convey happiness in his own unique way. He's the best speaker I've ever seen. Remi knows what love is. He shares his love unconditionally and without reservation. He's not greedy, nor does he care about people's skin color or religious beliefs. He's never told a lie. When he sings the nursery rhymes we used to sing as children and remembers the lyrics that I had forgotten, he reminds me that we know so little about the spiritual world, and that the unknown is so fascinating. Samuel is 16 years old, tall and handsome too. He has an extraordinary memory, but it's selective. He doesn't remember stealing my chocolate bar, but he remembers the release year of every song in my iPod. He also remembers a conversation we had when he was four years old, the time he peed on my arm while watching the first episode of Teletubbies, and Lady Gaga's birthday. Sounds amazing, right? But many people don't think so. The fact is, because their thinking doesn't conform to society's definition of normal, they're often isolated and misunderstood. But what makes me believe is that even if they're not seen as normal, it only shows one thing - they're extraordinary. Although they have autism, they're extraordinary. Some of you may not know the term "autism." It's a social disorder caused by complex brain function disorders, accompanied by learning disabilities and sometimes motor function disorders. Each case is unique, so Remi and Sam's situations are also different. Every 20 minutes, a new case of autism is diagnosed worldwide. Although it is one of the fastest growing diseases globally, we still don't understand its causes and treatments. I don't remember the first time I heard the word "autism," nor do I remember a time when I was completely ignorant of it. When I was three years old, my brother was born, and I was excited to have a new family member. But just a few months later, I realized he was different. He often screamed, didn't like playing like other babies did, and seemed uninterested in me. Remi immersed himself in his own world, using his own set of rules to find pleasure in even the smallest things, like arranging his toy cars around the house or staring at the washing machine and eating everything between him and the washing machine. As he grew older, he became even more unique, with his special qualities becoming more pronounced. In addition to frequent temper tantrums, frustration, and endless restlessness, he had an innocent and unbiased nature that allowed him to see the world as it was. He was a person who never lied. It's not easy. I cannot deny that my family has had difficult times. Sometimes I wish they were like me, but then I think about the things they have taught me about individuality, communication, and love. I realized that I don't want to trade these things for "normalcy." "Normalcy" overlooks the beauty of differences. Differences between people don't mean that one side is wrong; they just mean that there are different kinds of "right." To Remi, to Sam, and to all of you, I want to say that you don't have to be "normal." You can be extraordinary. Whether or not you have autism, the differences between us - every one of us - are what make us unique. Frankly, the pursuit of "normalcy" is the complete opposite of unlocking potential, excellence, progress, and change. It's the eradication of possibilities in our attempt to fit in with others. So don't call me "normal." Thank you.
Five years ago, I had an experience that was like wandering in Alice's Wonderland. Pennsylvania State University asked me, a communication professor, to teach communication to engineering students. I was scared. I was really scared. Their developed brains, the great works they read, and their long and obscure words all frightened me. But as the conversation progressed, my experience was like Alice's, following that rabbit hole down, and seeing that door leading to a whole new world. That was how I felt when I talked to those students. I was amazed by their ideas, and I hoped that others could experience this feeling in Wonderland too. I believe that the key to opening that door is to have good communication. To change the world, we urgently need good communication from our scientists and engineers. Our scientists and engineers are solving the biggest problems we face, from energy to the environment to healthcare, and so on. If we do not understand or comprehend their work, it will not mean anything to us, and I believe that we, as non-scientists, have a responsibility to interact and communicate with them. But if our scientists and engineers do not lead us into their wonderland, we cannot have good communication between us. So, scientists and engineers, please tell us what high technology is. I would like to share a few useful methods with you, to tell you how to ensure that we also find your science "sexy" and your engineering charming. The first thing you need to answer is our question: so what about high-tech? Tell us why your science is relevant to us. Don't just tell me you're studying bone trabeculae; tell me you're studying bone trabeculae because the network structure of this type of bone is important for understanding and treating osteoporosis. Additionally, when describing scientific principles, pay attention to the use of terminology. Terminology is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas. Of course, you can say "spatiotemporal," but why not just say "space and time"? That's much easier for us to understand. Making your ideas simple and easy to understand does not mean simplifying them. On the contrary, as Einstein said, make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. You don't have to change your viewpoint to clearly convey your scientific theory. You can consider using examples, stories, and analogies. These are ways to make your discussions attractive and exciting for us. Also, when presenting your research results with slides, don't use bullet points. Have you ever thought about why bullet points are called "bullets"? What are bullets for? Bullets can kill people, and they can also destroy your presentation. Such slides are not only boring but also too dependent on the language area of our brain, leaving us bewildered. On the other hand, this sample slide made by Genevieve Brown is much better. It shows us that the special structure of trabecular bone is super powerful, even inspiring the unique design of the Eiffel Tower. The trick here is to use simple and readable sentences, allowing the audience to grasp the main points even if they don't fully understand, and then provide some images that can stimulate our senses and give us a deeper understanding of the content being described. These are the keys I think can help all of us open that door and experience the wonders of science and engineering. Because the engineers I worked with taught me how to connect with my inner academic maniac, I want to summarize my views with a formula. Using the science you study, subtracting your bullet points and terminology, dividing by the relevant content, that is, to share content relevant to the audience, and then multiplying by your passion for the magical work you are doing, it will equal: interactive communication with full understanding and amazing results. Therefore, scientists and engineers, once you have solved this formula, find ways to talk to me about high-tech. Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English Dictionary is "snollygoster." Not just because it sounds great, but because it means "a shrewd politician." Although it's just a great definition given by a newspaper editor in the 19th century, his exact words were: "A snollygoster is a fellow who wants office, regardless of party, platform or principle, and who, whenever he wins, gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumancy."I have no idea what "talknophical" means, probably something related to language vocabulary, I assume. But language vocabulary is crucial to the workings of political centers, and all politicians understand that they must try to control their discourse. For example, it was not until 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report what politicians said in their debates. And in fact, this was all thanks to a brave man, the great name of Brass Crosby, who proposed it in Parliament. He was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned, but he still had the courage to propose it in Parliament, and in the end he won many supporters in London and won the victory. And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase "as bold as brass". Many people think this phrase comes from metal, but it actually comes from a champion of press freedom. However, to show how vocabulary and politics interact with each other, I would like to take you back to the early days of the United States when it had just declared independence. At that time, they had a problem of how to address George Washington, their leader. They didn't know what to call a republican leader. This issue was debated in Congress for a long time, and many suggestions were made, some of which seemed feasible. I mean, some people wanted to call him the Chief Executive Officer Washington, while others called him His Highness George Washington, and still others called him the Defender of the Liberties of the United Governments of America Washington. There was no name that really caught on. Some people just wanted to call him King. They thought that was a title that had been tried and tested in the past. They weren't even continuing with the monarchy, the idea was that you could be an elected king with a fixed term. You know, that might have worked. And everyone was so sick of it, in fact, because this debate went on for three weeks. I read the diary of one poor member of Congress who just recorded constantly, "This topic again." And the reason it got delayed and delayed was the House of Representatives versus the Senate. The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power. They didn't want to call him King, just in case he or his successor got any ideas. So they gave him a title that was the lowest, most insignificant, and most pathetic title they could think of. And that title was "President". They didn't invent this title. I mean, the title existed before, but it referred to the chairman of a meeting. Similar to the meaning of foreman or overseer. And it didn't seem very prestigious compared to "foreman" or "overseer". Although occasionally there were some small colonial meeting chairmen who had a hint of government management, it really was a title that meant nothing. And that's why the Senate opposed this title. They said it was really absurd. You can't call him a meeting chairman. This person has to sign treaties and receive foreign dignitaries. Who would take him seriously if he only had such a stupid little title, like the Chairman of the Government of the United States? After three weeks of debate, the Senate did not yield. As a compromise, they agreed to use the title "President" for the time being, but they also insisted that they would customise it to obtain a more respectable title through the Office of the Chief Executive Officer, regardless of whether the Democrats or Republicans were in power. This was out of respect for the practices and opinions of civilised countries. In addition, when communicating with foreign countries, the dignity of the American people might not be endangered by this peculiar title. We did not want to be seen as a bunch of freaks by future generations. From this story, you can learn three interesting things. First, and my favourite part, is that to date, the Senate has never formally recognised the title "President." Barack Obama's title of "President Obama" is still temporary, waiting for the Senate's sudden formal appointment. The second thing you can learn is that when the US government claims it is just a temporary measure, it will last for 223 years. The third and most important thing you can learn is that the title of President of the United States of America has never sounded lowly, has it? With control over more than 5,000 nuclear warheads, the world's largest economy, and a large number of warplanes and other military forces, the reality and history of this title have bestowed upon it a noble meaning. So in the end, the Senate won. They got the dignified title they wanted. And the other thing the Senate was worried about, the title sounded weird - oh, it sounded weird in those days. But now, do you know how many countries have a president? All because they wanted their title to sound like that guy with over 5,000 nuclear warheads, and so on. So in the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost because no one felt undignified when they were told they were now the President of the United States. And this is an important lesson that I think you can learn, and the point I want to leave you with. Politicians carefully choose their words and use vocabulary to shape and control reality, but in fact, reality changes vocabulary far more than vocabulary changes reality. Thank you very much.
I was in an illegal mine in Ghana, 50 meters underground. The air was polluted and hot, filled with dust, making it difficult to breathe. I could feel sweaty people passing by me, but in the darkness, I couldn't see anything else. I heard voices around me, but mostly it was coughing mixed with the noise of rudimentary tools smashing rocks. Like everyone else, I had a cheap flashlight on my head that flickered on and off, tied around my neck with a worn-out rubber band. I barely felt my way along the bare tree branch handrail on the wall, which supported the one-meter-square well, hundreds of meters deep. My hand slipped, and I immediately thought of a miner I had met a few days earlier. He reached out for something and fell into a bottomless pit. When I stand here today to speak to you, these miners are still working in such mines, risking their lives, without pay or compensation, and often losing their lives. I finally climbed out of the mine and went home, but these enslaved miners may never have the opportunity to go home again. For the past 28 years, I have been making documentaries about local cultures, visiting more than 70 countries on six continents. In 2009, I was honored to attend the Vancouver Peace Summit as an independent exhibitor, where I met many admirable people. I met a supporter of the non-governmental organization Free the Slaves, which is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery. We talked about slavery, and that was when I began to truly understand the reality of enslavement. Although I always knew that slavery still existed in the world, I had no idea of the severity of the situation. After our conversation, I felt terrible and realized my lack of knowledge about such a brutal phenomenon. I wondered how many others were also unaware. This thought made me restless.A few weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet with the head of Free the Slaves organization, hoping to make a difference. That's when my journey to delve into modern slavery began. It was strange because I had been to those places before, and some even felt like my second home, but this time, I had to uncover those dark secrets.According to conservative estimates, there are over 27 million people enslaved in the world today. This number is twice the total number of black slaves sold from Africa in the transatlantic slave trade. One hundred and fifty years ago, the price of a serf was equal to three times the annual salary of an average American worker, equivalent to $50,000 today. However, today, the cost of an entire family being enslaved for generations may only be a debt of $18. What is shocking is that the profits generated from global slavery exceed $13 billion each year. Many of those enslaved are deceived by false promises of good education and job opportunities, only to be forced to work without pay, endure violent threats, and be unable to escape. Today's slavery is about business interests, where products made by slaves have value, but the people creating the value are treated as disposable. Slavery exists in almost every corner of the world, even though it is illegal everywhere.In India and Nepal, I was taken to a brick kiln where the scene was extremely bizarre, like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante's description of hell. In temperatures over 50 degrees Celsius, men, women, children, and entire families mechanically stacked bricks on top of their heads under thick dust, 18 bricks at a time, then transported them to trucks hundreds of meters away from the kiln. They worked quietly, doing the same repetitive task over and over again for 16 to 17 hours a day, without breaks, food, or water. Due to extreme water scarcity, they basically didn't need to use the restroom. Because of the heat and dust inside, my camera was too hot to hold and could not function. Every 20 minutes, I had to run back to my car to clean my equipment and let it blow cold air under the air conditioner before it could restart. I sat in the car thinking that even the treatment my camera received was much better than these living people. When I returned to the kiln, I couldn't help but cry, but my abolitionist companion quickly grabbed me and said, "Lisa, don't cry here." He then explained to me that expressing emotions in such a place was dangerous, not just for me, but for these workers too. I couldn't provide any direct help to them. I couldn't give them money, and I had nothing to give them. I'm not a citizen of that country, and my actions could make their situation worse than it is now. I can only rely on the Free the Slaves organization to play a role in the system and liberate them. I believe they can do it. As for me, I have to wait until I get home to taste this heartache. In the Himalayas, I saw children working as laborers carrying heavy stones on their backs for several kilometers up mountain roads to wait for trucks by the roadside. The large slabs of stones they carried were even heavier than the children themselves. They made makeshift straps using branches, ropes, and old clothes to tie the stones onto their backs. Witnessing such a heavy and burdensome scene was extremely painful. How can we intervene in these hidden but widespread evils beyond public opinion? Some people do not even realize that they are being enslaved. They work sixteen to seventeen hours a day without any pay because they were born into this kind of life without any comparison. If these people were to fight for their own freedom, slave owners would burn down all their houses. These people have nothing, and they are scared and want to give up. However, the woman in the photo rallied the people and persisted. With the help of local abolitionists, they fought for the rental contract of the quarry. They continue to do the same heavy work, but now they do it for themselves and receive compensation. They have gained their freedom.Illegal sex trafficking is what we most commonly associate with slavery when we hear about it because it is widely known worldwide. I was warned that if I continued to document this industry, my personal safety would be difficult to guarantee. In Kathmandu, I was escorted by some women who were once sex slaves. They took me down narrow stairs to a dirty and dim basement. This was not a brothel itself; it was more like a restaurant with private rooms, well-known in the industry as a place for forced prostitution. In each small room, there were sex slaves, women and children, some as young as seven, forced to please customers so they would consume more food and alcohol. Each small room was dark and dirty, with numbers painted on the walls, separated by three plywood boards and curtains. Those who work here usually endure cruel sexual abuse from customers. I remember standing in almost complete darkness and feeling a strong sense of fear. In that moment, I was thinking about how terrifying it would be to be trapped in this hell. There was only one way out: the stairs I came down. There was no back door or window that could be passed through. There was only one way out: the staircase I had come down. There was no back door, no window that could be passed through by a person.When we face such a difficult issue, it is important to know that slavery, including illegal sex trafficking, exists in our own backyard. Thousands of people are enslaved as agricultural and restaurant workers, domestic servants, and more. Recently, the New York Times reported that 100,000 to 300,000 children are sold into sexual slavery every year in the United States. These things are happening around us, we just don't know it. The textile industry is also often associated with forced labor. I visited a village in India where the whole family were silk traders' slaves. This is a portrait of the family. The blackened hands belong to the father, the blue and red hands belong to the two sons. They stirred the fuel in a large barrel and then soaked the silk deeply in it until the dye was up to their elbows. These dyes were toxic. The translator told me their story. "We have no freedom," they said. "But we still hope that one day we can escape from this room and go somewhere else where we can work and receive payment." It is estimated that over 4,000 children are enslaved at the Volta Lake, the world's largest man-made lake. When we arrived there, I took a quick look around and saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat. Two brothers and a few young children, they looked alike, right? Wrong! They were all slaves. The children were taken from their homes, trafficked, and forced to work endlessly on the boat. They worked on the lake, and some of them didn't even know how to swim. This young boy was 8 years old. When our boat approached, he was trembling. He was afraid that our boat would hit his canoe and he would fall into the water. There are some tree branches submerged in the lake, and the fishing nets often get caught on them. These exhausted and frightened children are thrown into the water to untangle the nets. Many of them have drowned. He has been forced to work on the lake since he can remember. He is very afraid of his master and dare not run away. Because he was treated cruelly from a young age, he also treated the slaves younger than him in the same way. I saw these boys collecting the last fishing net at 5 a.m., but they had been working since 1 a.m. on such a cold and windy night. You know, when these fishing nets are full of fish, they can weigh thousands of pounds!Let me introduce you to Kofi. He was rescued from a fishing village and I met him in a shelter, which is used by the organization Free the Slaves to rehabilitate victims of slavery. In the photo, he was taking a bath by the well, pouring buckets of water over his head. The good news is that Kofi has now been reunited with his family. What's even more exciting is that they can now make a living on their own and ensure the safety of their children. Kofi embodies a possibility." Because someone took a stand and influenced his life, his future could change. Driving on a road in Ghana with partners from Free the Slaves, a fellow cyclist suddenly accelerated and came close to our car, knocking on the window. He asked us to take a dirt road to the jungle. At the end of the road, he urged us to get out of the car and quickly pointed to a row of indistinct footprints on the ground, saying, "Here, this way. Let's go!" We pushed aside the vines that blocked our path and walked for about an hour. The path was flooded by recent rain, and I lifted my camera equipment above my head, wading through chest-deep water to continue walking. We walked for another two hours, and the winding path abruptly ended. A large area of ​​pits appeared in front of us, each the size of a football field, and every pit had slaves working in it. Many women even carried their young children on their backs. They were panning for gold and walking in mercury-contaminated dirty water. Mercury is used to extract gold. These people were enslaved in another mine in Ghana. When they came out of the mine, their whole body was sweaty. I remember their eyes were bloodshot and full of exhaustion. Many of them had worked underground for 72 hours. These mines are almost 90 meters deep, and they lift bags filled with heavy stones. These stones are transported to another area to be crushed in order to extract gold. At first glance, all the men in the crushing area were strong, but as we approached, we found that some of the workers on the edge were disabled, and there were also some children. They were all victims of injuries, illnesses, and violence. In fact, these muscular men may suffer from mercury poisoning and tuberculosis like this person after a few years. This is Manuru. When his father died, his uncle sold him to the mine where he worked. After his uncle died, Manuru had to continue to bear his uncle's debt and was forced to work in the mine. When I met him, he had been working in the mine for 14 years. The leg injury seen in the photo was caused by a mining accident. The situation was critical at the time, and the doctor said he had to amputate his leg. In addition to this injury, he also suffered from tuberculosis, but he had to work underground day and night. Even so, he dreams of regaining his freedom. With the help of organizations like Free the Slaves, he is receiving an education. It is this belief that fills me with awe in the face of unimaginable suffering. I hope to shed light on these enslaved people's stories and their struggles. During my shoot, I brought many candles and, with the help of a translator, distributed them to my subjects. I hoped to illuminate their stories and their hardships. When we were all safe, I took this series of photos. They knew these images would be seen by people on the outside. I wanted them to know that we would bear witness to them, and do everything we could to change their lives. I truly believe that when we see them as our fellow human beings, it becomes impossible to tolerate the horrors of slavery. These images are not about issues, but about people - real people, just like you and me, who deserve the same rights, dignity, and respect in life. Not a day goes by when I don't think of these beautiful people who are treated unjustly. These people whom I have had the privilege of meeting in my lifetime. I hope that these images will inspire a force within you, the viewer. I hope that this spark of inspiration can become a beacon of hope for those who are enslaved because without it, the beasts of slavery will continue to live in the shadows. Thank you, everyone.
Well, I am studying applied mathematics. For every person who studies applied mathematics, there is a special challenge, which is that we and management consultants are very similar. No one knows what we do. So today I will give you some examples to explain what we do. Hmm, dancing is one of the many activities of human beings. We feel pleasure from ballet masters and tap dancers. You will know later. Nowadays, ballet requires extraordinary professional knowledge and outstanding professional skills, and even a certain level of adaptability, which may be called talent. However, sadly, neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease are slowly destroying this outstanding talent. This is happening to my friend Jan Striling, who was a ballet master in his time. He has received many treatments and has made great progress over the years. However, there are 6.3 million people in the world who suffer from this disease, and they also have to endure the torture of incurable weakness, tremors, stiffness, and other accompanying symptoms. So we need objective tools to detect it before it becomes severe. We need to objectively measure progress. Finally, the only way to know when there is a cure is to have objective measurement methods that can accurately answer those questions. However, the frustrating thing is that Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders have no biological markers. Therefore, you cannot do a simple blood test. The best we can do is a 20-minute neurological test. You have to go to the clinic, and it costs a lot. This also means that no one has ever done this test outside of clinical trials. But what if the patient could complete this test at home? This can also save patients the journey to the clinic. What if the patient could complete this test independently? Then there is no need to spend a lot of money to hire employees. By the way, if you go to a neurology clinic to do this test, it will cost $300. So I want to propose an unconventional method to you, a method that we can try to achieve our goals because, in a sense, at least we are all like art masters like my friend Jan Stripling.I have a video about vocal tremors. This is someone in a healthy state making a sound. We think of ourselves as ballet dancers of sound because when we make sounds, we need to coordinate these vocal organs. These are innate and require special training, like ballet. Think about how long it takes for a child to learn to speak. From the sound, we can trace the location of the vocal tremor. Just as Parkinson's can affect our limbs, it can also affect our vocal organs. You can see that the tremor trajectory at the bottom is an irregular vocal tremor. We see the same symptoms: vocal tremors, weakness, and rigidity. Speaking becomes quieter and more breathy afterwards. These are examples of symptoms. In fact, these sound effects are often quite elusive. But as long as there is any digital microphone, combined with sophisticated sound analysis software, and combined with the latest, now very advanced, machine studies, we can now accurately quantify where others are on the continuum of health and disease based solely on speech signals. These speech-based tests, how do they compare to professional clinical tests? In fact, they are both non-invasive technologies. Neurological tests are non-invasive, and they both use existing basic equipment. You don't need to design a series of new hospitals to complete the test. They are also accurate. That being said, voice-based tests are not expert-level, which means patients can do it themselves, and they are fast, taking no more than 30 seconds. The price is low, and we know what that means. Once the price is low, it can be massively expanded. I have some great goals that can be talked about now. We can reduce logistical problems associated with patients. There is no need to go to a clinic for routine check-ups. We can perform high-frequency monitoring to obtain objective data. We can recruit a large number of participants for clinical trials at a low cost. We can also make the scale of the population feasible in the first place. We also have the opportunity to start looking for early biological markers of the disease before it becomes fatal. So, starting today, we take the first step in this direction. We started the Parkinson's Voice Initiative project and worked with Aculab and PatientsLikeMe to record voices from around the world and collect enough data to achieve these four goals. Our phone number can receive calls from 750 million people on earth. Anyone who is healthy or has Parkinson's disease can call in, and it's cheap to leave a recording, only a few cents each time. I am pleased to announce that we have achieved 6% of our target in just 8 hours. Thank you.Tom Rielly: Max, with these samples, can you identify who is healthy and who is sick among 10,000 people? What do you want to get from these samples?Max Little: Yes, that's right. During the call, you have to tell us if you have this disease. You know, some people may not call us, or the call may not go through, but we will still get a lot of samples from different environments. The key is different environments, so that we can eliminate those confusing factors and look for the true markers of this disease. TR: So now you have an 86% accuracy rate? ML: We've gone way beyond that. In fact, I have to mention my student Thanasis because he's done some amazing work. He's now demonstrated that this can be done on a mobile phone network, so we're now approaching 99% accuracy. TR: Ninety-nine, well that's pretty impressive. So this also means that people can- ML: TR: People can call your phone number with their mobile phone and do this test, and Parkinson's patients can call in and record their voice, and then their doctor can check their progress and determine which stage of the disease they're in. ML: That's right. TR: Well, thank you very much, Max Little, and everyone. ML: Thank you, Tom.
Before March 2011, I was a photo retoucher based in New York City. We were pale and lifeless, with faces ashen. We always worked in pitch-black, windowless studios, mainly to ward off sunlight. We helped slim down already thin models, perfected flawless skin, and made the impossible possible. We were constantly criticized by the media, but we were actually talented artists with a wealth of experience and an appreciation for images and photos.On March 11, 2011, like everyone else in the world, I watched the tragedy unfold in Japan from my home. Soon after, I joined a volunteer organization called "Joining Hands Volunteers" and went to the disaster site to participate in emergency rescue activities within a few days. Myself and over 100 other volunteers knew that we couldn't just sit at home and wait. Therefore, I decided to join them and do three weeks of volunteer rescue work.On May 13, I arrived in Ofunato, Iwate Prefecture, a small fishing village in Japan with a population of only about 50,000 people, which was one of the first areas affected by the disaster. At the highest point of the tsunami, the waves were over 24 meters high and reached up to 2 miles inland. You can imagine that this small town was definitely devastated. We cleared the rubble from the canals and ditches, helped clean up schools and buried houses for rebuilding and renovation. We cleared a large number of smelly, rotting fish corpses, which were processed and treated in local factories. We ourselves became dirty and smelly, but we were very happy in our hearts.For several weeks in a row, all the volunteers and local residents found something similar. They kept discovering photos, albums, cameras, and SD cards. Everyone's reaction and actions were the same. They collected these photos and other items and sent them to various towns for safekeeping. It wasn't until now that I realized that losing these photos was certainly a significant loss for these people. When they were hit by the tsunami, it is imaginable that they had to run around seeking a ray of hope and naturally abandoned everything else, all of their belongings. During the last few days of my first week in Japan, I found myself helping to clean a huge bathtub in a community hot spring of the town's evacuation center. Coincidentally, the local evacuation center was collecting lost photos, and people brought the collected photos to that community hot spring. I was very fortunate to have gained their trust, and I started to clean and restore those photos. Those moments were touching and very inspiring. I had always heard people say, "Be creative!" It wasn't until I cleaned those photos that I truly became "creative." When I looked at those photos, some of them had a history of over a hundred years, and some were still kept in envelopes in processing labs. I couldn't help but think from a photo retoucher's perspective, maybe I could help them restore these torn and scratched photos. Moreover, I knew many people who could help them restore these photos. So, in the evening, I logged on to Facebook and asked some retoucher friends. Before the next morning, there were many, many replies saying that they were willing to help. I knew we had to take action, so we started our photo restoration campaign. This is the first photo we tried to restore. It's not too badly damaged, but the place that was soaked by water caused the little girl's face in the photo to fade. We had to carefully repair it to be very precise, otherwise, the little girl's face wouldn't look like her own--how tragic it would be, just like destroying the photo. As time went on, more and more photos that needed to be repaired were shipped over, and we needed more retouchers to help process these photos. So I logged onto Facebook and professional networking sites for help. In just five days, 80 retouchers expressed their willingness to help, from 12 different countries. Within two weeks, I received replies from a total of 150 volunteers, all willing to join our cause. As of July, we had established multiple branches within Japan, some in the nearby town of Rikuzentakata, some branches as far north as Ibaraki Prefecture. Every week, we set up scanning equipment in temporary photo studios, and people came to these temporary photo studios to pick up their photos. Sometimes, some elderly women had never seen a scanner before. When they found their lost photos, they could scan the photos with us in just ten minutes, then upload them to the cloud server, and then the uploaded photos could be downloaded by a non-Japanese or unfamiliar person from the other side of the earth, and then the photos would start to be restored. However, the time it took for them to retrieve these photos at that time was completely different, of course, depending on the degree of damage, it could be repaired in as little as an hour, or it could take several weeks or even months. The beautiful kimonos in the photos must be hand-drawn or pieced together bit by bit, and then matched with the missing colors. The undamaged parts of the photos need to be processed in detail. The entire process is very time-consuming. All these photos affected by the tsunami were soaked in salt water, invaded by bacteria, buried in garbage, and sometimes even contaminated by oil. All these factors will continue to damage these photos over time. Therefore, manual cleaning of photos is a major part of this project. If these photos are not cleaned first, we cannot proceed with the restoration process. Before restoration, they must also be dried and claimed. Our manual cleaning activities went very smoothly, and a local woman guided us in the cleaning process. These photos can easily be damaged again, as my captain Wayne once said, it's like tattooing on a person. You can't make any mistakes, otherwise the results will be a mess. The woman who gave us these photos was very fortunate, as far as these photos were concerned. She began to clean them herself until she realized that she was actually causing more damage to the photos. Fortunately, she had backups of the photos. Otherwise, the faces of her and her husband in the photos would not have been fully restored. As a result, we were able to integrate all the parts into a good photo and then reproduce that photo. When she received the photos from us, she shared some of the stories behind the photos. Her husband's colleagues actually found these photos under the rubble of the local fire department. The place was actually far from her home, yet they recognized him. On the day of the tsunami, he was responsible for ensuring that the tsunami defense gate was closed. When the alarm sounded, he had to rush to the front line of the tsunami. Her two sons, although not small, were still attending two different schools, one of which was hit by the tsunami. It took her a full week to find her missing relatives, and at that time they had all escaped death. On the day we restored her photos happened to be her younger son's 14th birthday! For her, despite the unfortunate disaster and various hardships, those photos were the best gift for her son. These photos allowed him to revisit and regain his memories, and they were no longer just the imprint left on him from that day in March when everything in his life changed, or rather was destroyed. After staying in Japan for six months, "All Hands Volunteers" had 1,100 volunteers who joined to help with disaster relief in Japan. Several hundred of them helped us hand-clean over 135,000 photos, most of which were eventually returned to their owners, which was exceptionally important. More than 500 volunteers from around the world helped us retrieve hundreds of photos for 90 families, all of which were restored and repaired. During this time, we did not spend thousands of dollars on equipment or materials, as most of the work was done using printer ink. We often take photos. Photos serve as a reminder and a keepsake, reminding us of certain people, events, places, emotions, or loved ones. They help us record, preserve memories and our past, and photos are the easiest things to overlook in an emergency, but sometimes they are the first things we want to retrieve after the storm. This is what this project is all about, restoring a small fragment of humanity, reclaiming people's connection to the past. When such a photo returns to its owner, it will bring a huge difference and make a big difference in the owner's life. This project has also brought great changes to us photo editors. For some photo editors, this experience has connected them to something bigger, such as giving back to society and using their talents not just for slim models and people with perfect skin. I want to read an email to you as a conclusion. I received one from Cindy on the day I returned home from Japan six months later. "When I was restoring those photos, I couldn't help but think of each person and the stories conveyed in the photos. One in particular, with women of all ages from grandmothers to little girls, gathered around a baby, really touched my heart because I have a similar photo in my home with my grandmother, mother, and me gathered around my newborn daughter. Across the globe and across age boundaries, we all have some basic needs that never change, don't we?" Thank you all!
Dr. Edgerton's photo of shooting an apple with a bullet has inspired our admiration and curiosity. The exposure time of this photo was only one millionth of a second. But now, fifty years later, we can capture the world even faster, not only in one millionth of a second, or even one billionth of a second, but in one trillionth of a second. Now I'm going to show you a new type of photography called femtosecond imaging. This is a technology that is so fast that it can capture the movement of light. So with this technology, we can create cameras that can see the bend in the light path, cameras that can see beyond our field of view or see through our bodies without X-rays. These cameras challenge our definition of cameras.Now, if I use a laser pointer and switch it on and off in one trillionth of a second - that's just a few femtoseconds - I will create some photons. These photons are only a few millimeters wide and, like bullets, will travel at the speed of light, which is a million times faster than bullets. Now, if you shoot these photons into a bottle, what will happen when they hit the bottle? What will light look like in slow motion?Now, watch the whole thing - (applause) (applause) - remember, this whole thing actually happens in one nanosecond - that's the time it takes for light to travel. But now I'm going to slow down this video a million times to show you the motion of light. But Coca-Cola did not fund this experiment. Now, many things will happen here, so let me show you one by one. Now, the beam of light enters the bottle, which is our bullet, passes through the bottle, and scatters inside. Some light flows out and reaches the table, so you begin to see these ripples. Many photons eventually reach the bottle cap and scatter around. You can see an air bubble bouncing inside. At the same time, the ripples also reach the table, and you can see that, due to reflection at the top, after a few frames at the bottom of the bottle, the reflections converge. Now, if you use a regular bullet to travel the same distance and slow down the video by the same amount, which is one million times, do you know how long you have to wait to see the whole process? A day, a week? In fact, it is one year. This would, of course, be a boring video of a slow-moving, regular bullet. But what about photographing still objects? You can see the ripples spreading out on the table again, with tomatoes and walls in the background. It's like throwing a stone into a pond. I think this is how nature paints a tomato, moment by moment, but of course, what our eyes see is the overall combination. But if you take a closer look at this tomato, you will notice that when light travels on the surface of the tomato, it keeps flashing. It doesn't get darker. Why? Because the tomato is ripe, and the light is reflected inside the tomato and comes out after a few trillionths of a second. So, in the future, when a femto-imaging camera is in your phone, you can go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without touching it. So, how did my team at MIT create this camera? Now, as a photographer, you know that if you want a short exposure, you only have a little bit of light, but we need to be a million times faster than the shortest exposure time, so you almost don't get any light. So what we did was to send these photons in and repeat it millions of times, each time with excellent synchronized video, and then weave a picture from several gigabytes of data, which is what you saw earlier. And when we included all the raw data, we did some interesting processing. Now, Superman can fly. Some other heroes can turn invisible, but imagine a future Superman: he can see behind corners. This principle is that we can shine some light on the door, and that light will reflect into the room, some of it will bounce back to the door, and then into the camera, so we can use that reflection of light. This is not science fiction. We really made it. On the left, you see our femtosecond imaging camera. Behind the wall, there is a human model, and we will be reflecting light off of it. So after our paper was published in "Nature," it was recommended on the "Nature" website, and they created this animation. "We are going to launch these photons, and they are going to hit this wall, and because the beam of light scatters in all directions, some will eventually hit our hidden dummy, and continue to scatter until some light hits the door, and some of the light will eventually return to the camera, but the interesting thing is, they will arrive at slightly different times. And because we have a camera that can run so fast, which is our femtosecond camera, this camera has some special abilities. It has good time resolution and can capture the world at the speed of light. So this way, we not only know the distance from the camera to the door, but also know the distance to the hidden object, but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance. By using lasers, we can record a raw image, which is what you see on the screen, seems meaningless, but then we take many, many pictures, put them together, and analyze the reflection of light. Now, can we see the hidden object? Can we understand it in 3D? This is our model reconstruction. Now we still have some way to go in applying them to life, but in the future, we can put this technology into cars so that they can prevent collisions because they can see around corners." Or we can search for survivors because we can see the light reflected on the windows, or we can build a perspective instrument to see the situation inside the body, and we can even see the heart in perspective. But of course, due to the interference of various tissues and blood, this is quite difficult, so we call on scientists to really pay attention to femtosecond imaging and use this technology as a new model to solve the health problems of the next generation. Now, just like Dr. Edgerton, a scientist, science has become an art, a high-speed photography art, and I realize that every time we collect a lot of data, it is not just scientific imaging, but also a new computational photography, which contains time delay and color coding. We see these ripples. Remember, the time between these ripples is only a few trillionths of a second. But some interesting things are happening when you see these ripples under the lids, they are moving away from us. But these ripples should be moving towards us. What happened? The result is that because we are recording these things at almost the speed of light, we have some strange phenomena that Einstein would be quite happy to see in these pictures. The sequence of events is sometimes reversed in the camera, so by warping time and space correspondingly, we can correct this distortion. So whether it's seeing around corners, making healthy images for the next generation, or adding new visualizations, since our invention, we have put all the data and details on our website, and we hope that this DIY, this creative research community can tell us that we should not be obsessed with high pixels but should start to pay attention to another dimension of imaging technology. Time's up. Thank you.
Hi, this is my cellphone. A cellphone can change people's lives and give you personal freedom. With a cellphone, you can capture human rights abuses in Syria. With a cellphone, you can tweet and start a protest in Egypt. With a cellphone, you can record a song and upload it to SoundCloud and become famous overnight. All of this is possible if you have a cellphone.I was born in 1984, and I live in Berlin. Let's go back to the past, back to Berlin in 1984. You can see thousands of people standing up and protesting for change. This was in the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of those people had a cellphone in their pockets, Now, who here has a phone? Please raise your hand. Hold up your phone! Android, Blackberry, wow, there are quite a few. Almost everyone has a phone now. But today, I want to tell you the story of me and my phone and how it has changed my life. Let me tell you, there are 35,830 lines of raw data here. Why am I showing you this data? In the summer of 2006, the European Commission launched a directive called the "Data Retention Directive." The directive stated that every telecommunication and internet service provider in Europe must retain a large amount of user data. This included information about who called whom, who sent emails or text messages to whom, and where people used their phones. All of this information was to be kept by telecommunication companies for a period of six months to two years. Internet service providers were also required to comply.The people of Europe rose up in protest, saying "We don't want this." They wanted to take control in the digital age and didn't want telecommunication and internet service providers to retain their data. There are lawyers, journalists, and pastors among the people who say, "We don't need this." These are the approximately 10,000 people you see taking to the streets of Berlin, calling out, "We want freedom, not fear." Some even say that this could become Stasi 2.0. Before, Stasi was the secret police in East Germany. I also asked myself, will it really be like this? Can they really store all our data? Will they do this every time I use my phone? So I consulted my telecommunications company, Deutsche Telekom, which was the largest telecommunications company in Germany at the time. I told them, please send me all the data you have stored about me. I repeatedly requested this, but I only received evasive responses like ripples in the water. But I persisted, I want my data, because what they record and store is my life. So I decided to sue them because I wanted my data back. But Deutsche Telekom refused, saying "We will not give it to you." In the end, we reached an agreement: I dropped the lawsuit and they sent me the data I had requested. During this period, the German Constitutional Court explicitly stated that incorporating this European directive into German law was unconstitutional. Then I received this ugly, leather envelope with a CD inside. On the CD, you can see the 35,830 lines of data information that you see now. At first, when I saw all of this, I felt helpless. Okay, this file is really big. After a while, I realized that this was my life. Then I was a bit worried about how to deal with this data, because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, and what I'm doing. Then I decided to lay it all out and make this data public, because I wanted people to understand what data retention is all about. So with the help of Time Online and OpenDataCity, I created this visual representation of my half-year life. You can zoom in and out, you can replay and fast forward, and you can see every footprint I made. You can even see how I took the train from Frankfurt to Cologne and how often I made phone calls on the way. With this data, everything becomes possible. This sounds a bit scary, but it's not just about me. It's about all of us. First of all, it's simple. I called my wife, and she called me. We talked to each other a few times. Then some friends called me, and they also contacted each other. Then he called her, and she called her, and we formed a huge communication network. But you can see who is communicating with whom, when they make calls, and when they go to sleep. Everything is under your nose. If you have this data, you'll know who the leader of this circle is, and what your social circle is doing. If you have this data, you can manipulate your social circle. This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran. This is also a blueprint for monitoring your social circle, because you'll know who's talking to whom, who's emailing whom - all of this is possible. If you have this data, and it can be kept for at least six months - in Europe, the maximum is two years - then think about those people who took to the streets of Berlin in the autumn of 1989. If they all had phones in their pockets, the Stasi would know who was involved in the protest. If the Stasi had known in advance who was the instigator of the event, the protest would never have taken place. The Berlin Wall would not have fallen, and the Iron Curtain of the Cold War would not have come down. Because now, state agencies and companies want to keep as much data as possible about us, whether online or in real life. They don't want to miss any opportunity to track our lives, and they also want to keep this data permanently. However, self-determination and living in this digital age are not contradictory. It's just that now you have to fight for autonomy yourself. You have to fight for it every day. So when you go back, tell your friends that privacy is important in the 21st century, it is not outdated. After you go back, tell those representatives that although those companies and state agencies can retain data information, they do not necessarily have to do so. If you don't believe me, ask your telecommunications company what information they have about you. So in the future, every time you use your phone, let it remind you that you have to fight for autonomy in this digital age. Thank you.
