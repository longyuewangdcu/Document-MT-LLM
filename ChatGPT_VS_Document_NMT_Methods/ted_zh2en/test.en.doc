Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman  introduced a design challenge  called the marshmallow challenge. And the idea's pretty simple:  Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure  out of 20 sticks of spaghetti,  one yard of tape, one yard of string  and a marshmallow. The marshmallow has to be on top. And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard  because it forces people  to collaborate very quickly. And so, I thought this was an interesting idea,  and I incorporated it into a design workshop. And it was a huge success. And since then, I've conducted  about 70 design workshops across the world  with students and designers and architects,  even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,  and there's something about this exercise  that reveals very deep lessons  about the nature of collaboration,  and I'd like to share some of them with you. So, normally, most people begin  by orienting themselves to the task. They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,  they jockey for power. Then they spend some time planning, organizing,  they sketch and they lay out spaghetti. They spend the majority of their time  assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures. And then finally, just as they're running out of time,  someone takes out the marshmallow,  and then they gingerly put it on top,  and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! --  they admire their work. But what really happens, most of the time,  is that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh,"  because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure  to buckle and to collapse. So there are a number of people  who have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others,  and among the worst are recent graduates of business school. They lie, they cheat, they get distracted  and they produce really lame structures. And of course there are teams  that have a lot more "ta-da" structures,  and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten. And it's pretty amazing. As Peter tells us,  not only do they produce the tallest structures,  but they're the most interesting structures of them all. So the question you want to ask is:  How come? Why? What is it about them? And Peter likes to say that  none of the kids spend any time  trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right? They don't spend time jockeying for power. But there's another reason as well. And the reason is that business students are trained  to find the single right plan, right? And then they execute on it. And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,  they run out of time and what happens? It's a crisis. Sound familiar? Right. What kindergarteners do differently  is that they start with the marshmallow,  and they build prototypes, successive prototypes,  always keeping the marshmallow on top,  so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way. Designers recognize this type of collaboration  as the essence of the iterative process. And with each version, kids get instant feedback  about what works and what doesn't work. So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,  but let's look at how different teams perform. So the average for most people is around 20 inches;  business schools students, about half of that;  lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,  kindergarteners, better than most adults. Who does the very best? Architects and engineers, thankfully. Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen. And why is it? Because they understand triangles  and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns  are the key to building  stable structures. So CEOs, a little bit better than average,  but here's where it gets interesting. If you put you put an executive admin. on the team,  they get significantly better. It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win." You can just tell beforehand. And why is that? Because they have special skills  of facilitation. They manage the process, they understand the process. And any team who manages  and pays close attention to work  will significantly improve the team's performance. Specialized skills and facilitation skills  are the combination that leads to strong success. If you have 10 teams that typically perform,  you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures. And I tried something interesting. I thought, let's up the ante, once. So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team. So what do you think happened to these design students? What was the result? Here's what happened:  Not one team had a standing structure. If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,  they would have taken home the prize. So, isn't that interesting? That high stakes  have a strong impact. We did the exercise again with the same students. What do you think happened then? So now they understand the value of prototyping. So the same team went from being the very worst  to being among the very best. They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time. So there's deep lessons for us  about the nature of incentives and success. So, you might ask: Why would anyone  actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge? And the reason is, I help create  digital tools and processes  to help teams build cars and video games  and visual effects. And what the marshmallow challenge does  is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions. Because, frankly,  every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it? The challenge provides a shared experience,  a common language,  a common stance to build the right prototype. of this so simple exercise. And those of you who are interested  may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com. It's a blog that you can look at  how to build the marshmallows. There's step-by-step instructions on this. There are crazy examples from around the world  of how people tweak and adjust the system. There's world records that are on this as well. And the fundamental lesson, I believe,  is that design truly is  a contact sport. It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,  and that we apply the very best of our thinking,  our feeling and our doing  to the challenge that we have at hand. And sometimes, a little prototype of this experience  is all that it takes to turn us  from an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment. And that can make a big difference. Thank you very much. 
Let's pretend right here we have a machine. A big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine,  and it's a time machine. And everyone in this room has to get into it. And you can go backwards, you can go forwards;  you cannot stay where you are. And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends  this question a lot lately and they all want to go back. I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles  or Twitter or "American Idol." I don't know. I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull  to nostalgia, to wishful thinking. And I understand that. I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say. I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous. It's because possibilities on this planet,  they don't go back, they go forward. So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward. This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet  by any measure that you wish to choose:  health, wealth,  mobility, opportunity,  declining rates of disease ... There's never been a time like this. My great-grandparents died, all of them,  by the time they were 60. My grandparents pushed that number to 70. My parents are closing in on 80. So there better be  a nine at the beginning of my death number. But it's not even about people like us,  because this is a bigger deal than that. A kid born in New Delhi today  can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago. Think about that, it's an incredible fact. And why is it true? Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions  of people on this planet. It reshaped the demography of the globe  in a way that no war ever has. It's gone. It's vanished. We vanquished it. Puff. In the rich world,  diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago  no longer exist, hardly. Diphtheria, rubella, polio ... does anyone even know what those things are? Vaccines, modern medicine,  our ability to feed billions of people,  those are triumphs of the scientific method. And to my mind, the scientific method --  trying stuff out,  seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't --  is one of the great accomplishments of humanity. So that's the good news. Unfortunately, that's all the good news  because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times. And one of them is that  despite all our accomplishments,  a billion people go to bed hungry  in this world every day. That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful. And not only that, we've used our imagination  to thoroughly trash this globe. Potable water, arable land,  rainforests, oil, gas:  they're going away, and they're going away soon,  and unless we innovate our way out of this mess,  we're going away too. So the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can. I think it's clear that we can make food  that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on. I think we can power this world with energy  that doesn't also destroy it. I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking. But here's the thing that keeps me up at night --  one of the things that keeps me up at night:  We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never. And we've also never been in a position  to deploy it properly in the way that we can today. We're on the verge of amazing, amazing events  in many fields,  and yet I actually think we'd have to go back  hundreds, 300 years, before the Enlightenment,  to find a time when we battled progress,  when we fought about these things  more vigorously, on more fronts, than we do now. People wrap themselves in their beliefs,  and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free. Not even the truth will set them free. And, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion;  they're even entitled to their opinion about progress. But you know what you're not entitled to? You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not. And this took me awhile to figure out. About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines  for The New Yorker. A little story. And I was amazed to find opposition:  opposition to what is, after all,  the most effective public health measure in human history. I didn't know what to do,  so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on. And soon after that,  I wrote a story about genetically engineered food. Same thing, only bigger. People were going crazy. So I wrote a story about that too,  and I couldn't understand why  people thought this was "Frankenfoods,"  why they thought moving molecules around  in a specific, rather than a haphazard way,  was trespassing on nature's ground. But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on. I mean, I'm a journalist. We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine. But these stories bothered me,  and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did. And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy  weren't actually fanatics at all. They were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people. They were exactly like the people in this room. And it just disturbed me so much. But then I thought, you know, let's be honest. We're at a point in this world  where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to. We talk about it ambivalently. We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it:  "progress." Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are. We've lost faith in institutions,  in authority,  and sometimes in science itself,  and there's no reason we shouldn't have. You can just say a few names  and people will understand. Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger,  Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction,  hanging chads. You know, you can choose your list. There are questions and problems  with the people we used to believe were always right,  so be skeptical. Ask questions, demand proof, demand evidence. Don't take anything for granted. But here's the thing: When you get proof,  you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that. And the reason that I can say that is because  we're now in an epidemic of fear  like one I've never seen and hope never to see again. About 12 years ago, there was a story published,  a horrible story,  that linked the epidemic of autism  to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot. Very scary. Tons of studies were done to see if this was true. Tons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue. The data came back. The data came back from the United States, from England,  from Sweden, from Canada,  and it was all the same: no correlation,  no connection, none at all. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter  because we believe anecdotes,  we believe what we see, what we think we see,  what makes us feel real. We don't believe a bunch of documents  from a government official giving us data,  and I do understand that, I think we all do. But you know what? The result of that has been disastrous. Disastrous because here's a fact:  The United States is one of the only countries in the world  where the vaccine rate for measles is going down. That is disgraceful,  and we should be ashamed of ourselves. It's horrible. What kind of a thing happened  that we could do that? Now, I understand it. I do understand it. Because, did anyone have measles here? Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles? Doesn't happen very much. Doesn't happen in this country at all,  but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year. That's a lot of death of measles --  20 an hour. But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds,  and people like Jenny McCarthy  can go around preaching messages  of fear and illiteracy from platforms  like "Oprah" and "Larry King Live." And they can do it because  they don't link causation and correlation. They don't understand that these things seem the same,  but they're almost never the same. And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon. This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk. He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us. No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone. That guy in the middle, not so much. His name is Paul Offit. He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people. It'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids  in the developing world every year. Pretty good, right? Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines  and says how valuable they are  and that people ought to just stop the whining. And he actually says it that way. So, Paul's a terrorist. When Paul speaks in a public hearing,  he can't testify without armed guards. He gets called at home  because people like to tell him  that they remember where his kids go to school. And why? Because Paul made a vaccine. I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential. You take them away, disease comes back,  horrible diseases. And that's happening. We have measles in this country now. And it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids  are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game. And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio? Let's have that. Why not? A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said  she thought I was a little strident. No one's ever said that before. She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio,  no way. Fine. Why? Because we don't have polio. And you know what? We didn't have polio in this country yesterday. Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning,  and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio. And he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car,  and he's going to come to Long Beach,  and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight. And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease,  and we don't either because that's the way the world works. That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't. Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it. Everyone take their vitamins this morning? Echinacea, a little antioxidant  to get you going. I know you did because half of Americans do every day. They take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines,  and it doesn't matter how often  we find out that they're useless. The data says it all the time. They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that. It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine? I'm totally with you. Dark urine. Dark. Why do we do that? Why do we do that? Well, I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma. We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man. And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks. It's cruel to millions of people. It's absolutely astonishingly cold  and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it. So we run away from it, and where do we run? We leap into the arms of Big Placebo. That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo. But, you know, it's really a serious thing  because this stuff is crap,  and we spend billions of dollars on it. And I have all sorts of little props here. None of it ... ginkgo, fraud;  echinacea, fraud;  acai -- I don't even know what that is  but we're spending billions of dollars on it -- it's fraud. And you know what? When I say this stuff, people scream at me,  and they say, "What do you care? Let people do what they want to do. It makes them feel good." And you know what? You're wrong. Because I don't care  if it's the secretary of HHS  who's saying, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence  of my experts on mammograms,"  or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient  with coffee enemas. When you start down the road  where belief and magic replace evidence and science,  you end up in a place you don't want to be. You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa. He killed 400,000 of his people  by insisting that beetroot,  garlic and lemon oil  were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs  we know can slow the course of AIDS. Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths  in a country that has been plagued  worse than any other by this disease. Please, don't tell me  there are no consequences to these things. There are. There always are. Now, the most mindless epidemic  we're in the middle of right now  is this absurd battle  between proponents of genetically engineered food  and the organic elite. It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop. It's a debate about words, about metaphors. It's ideology, it's not science. Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice,  every sprig of parsley,  every Brussels sprout  has been modified by man. You know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden. There wasn't any cantaloupe.   There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all. We made it over the last 11,000 years. And some of it worked, and some of it didn't. We got rid of the stuff that didn't. Now we can do it in a more precise way --  and there are risks, absolutely --  but we can put something like vitamin A into rice,  and that stuff can help millions of people,  millions of people, prolong their lives. You don't want to do that? I have to say, I don't understand it. We object to genetically engineered food. Why do we do that? Well, the things I constantly hear are:  Too many chemicals,  pesticides, hormones,  monoculture, we don't want giant fields  of the same thing, that's wrong. We don't companies patenting life. We don't want companies owning seeds. And you know what my response to all of that is? Yes, you're right. Let's fix it. It's true, we've got a huge food problem,  but this isn't science. This has nothing to do with science. It's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff. You know science isn't a company. It's not a country. It's not even an idea; it's a process. It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,  but the idea that we should not allow  science to do its job  because we're afraid,  is really very deadening,  and it's preventing millions of people  from prospering. You know, in the next 50 years  we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now,  70 percent. This investment in Africa over the last 30 years. Disgraceful. Disgraceful. They need it, and we're not giving it to them. And why? Genetically engineered food. We don't want to encourage people  to eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance. Cassava's something that half a billion people eat. It's kind of like a potato. It's just a bunch of calories. It sucks. It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein,  and scientists are engineering  all of that into it right now. And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind. They wouldn't starve, and you know what? That would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse,  but it would be nice. And all I can say about this is:  Why are we fighting it? I mean, let's ask ourselves: Why are we fighting it? Because we don't want to move genes around? This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals. It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones,  our insistence on having bigger food,  better food, singular food. This isn't about Rice Krispies,  this is about keeping people alive,  and it's about time we started to understand what that meant. Because, you know something? If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting,  we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of:  high-tech colonialism. There's no other way to describe what's going on here. It's selfish, it's ugly,  it's beneath us,  and we really have to stop it. So after this amazingly fun conversation,    you might want to say, "So, you still want to get in this  ridiculous time machine and go forward?" Absolutely. Absolutely, I do. It's stuck in the present right now,  but we have an amazing opportunity. We can set that time machine on anything we want. We can move it where we want to move it,  and we're going to move it where we want to move it. We have to have these conversations and we have to think,  but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead,  we're going to be happy we do. I know that we can,  and as far as I'm concerned,  that's something the world needs right now. Thank you. 
One day, Los Angeles Times columnist  Steve Lopez was walking along  the streets of downtown Los Angeles  when he heard beautiful music. And the source was a man,  an African-American man,  charming, rugged, homeless,  playing a violin that only had two strings. And I'm telling a story that many of you know,  because Steve's columns became the basis  for a book, which was turned into a movie,  with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,  and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers,  the Juilliard-trained double bassist  whose promising career was cut short  by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia. Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,  and 30 years later he was living homeless  on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie  to understand not only the beautiful bond  that formed between these two men,  but how music helped shape that bond,  and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun --  in helping Nathaniel get off the streets. I met Mr. Ayers in 2008,  two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall. He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies,  and came backstage and introduced himself. He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way  about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton  and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series,  all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later  saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment  because when he was treated it was with shock therapy  and Thorazine and handcuffs,  and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. But as a result now, he is prone to  these schizophrenic episodes,  the worst of which can manifest themselves as  him exploding  and then disappearing for days,  wandering the streets of Skid Row,  exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind  unleashed upon him. And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation  when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --  he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,  he was lost. And he was talking about  invisible demons and smoke,  and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. And I was afraid,  not for myself, but I was afraid  that I was going to lose him,  that he was going to sink into one of his states,  and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin  if I started talking about scales  and arpeggios and other exciting forms of  didactic violin pedagogy. So, I just started playing. And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. And as I played,  I understood that there was a profound change  occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,  a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music  was its catalyst. And Nathaniel's manic rage  was transformed into understanding,  a quiet curiosity and grace. And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin  and he started playing, by ear,  certain snippets of violin concertos  which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,  And we started talking about music, from Bach  to Beethoven and Brahms,  Bruckner, all the B's,  from Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen. And I understood that he not only  had an encyclopedic knowledge of music,  but he related to this music at a personal level. He spoke about it with the kind of passion  and understanding that I share with my colleagues  in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And through playing music and talking about music,  this man had transformed  from the paranoid, disturbed man  that had just come from walking the streets  of downtown Los Angeles  to the charming, erudite,  brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician. Music is medicine. Music changes us. And for Nathaniel, music is sanity. Because music allows him to take his thoughts  and delusions and shape them  through his imagination and his creativity,  into reality. And that is an escape  from his tormented state. And I understood that this was the very essence of art. This was the very reason why we made music,  that we take something that exists within all of us  at our very fundamental core,  our emotions,  and through our artistic lens,  through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality. And the reality of that expression  reaches all of us  and moves us, inspires and unites us. And for Nathaniel,  music brought him back into a fold of friends. The redemptive power of music brought him back  into a family of musicians  that understood him,  that recognized his talents  and respected him. And I will always make music with Nathaniel,  whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall  or on Skid Row, because he reminds me  why I became a musician. Thank you. Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks. Robert Gupta. Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists. So, please forgive me. 
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer. I've been making games online now for 10 years,  and my goal for the next decade  is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life  as it is to save the world in online games. Now, I have a plan for this,  and it entails convincing more people,  including all of you, to spend more time playing bigger and better games. Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games. Some of you might be thinking,  "That's a lot of time to spend playing games. Maybe too much time,  considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world." But actually, according to my research at the Institute for the Future,  actually the opposite is true. Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play  to solve the world's most urgent problems. In fact, I believe that if we want to survive  the next century on this planet,  we need to increase that total dramatically. I've calculated the total we need  at 21 billion hours of game play every week. So, that's probably a bit of a counter-intuitive idea,  so I'll say it again, let it sink in:  If we want to solve problems like hunger,  poverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity,  I believe that we need to aspire to play games online  for at least 21 billion hours a week, by the end of the next decade. No. I'm serious. I am. Here's why. This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential  to the future survival of the human species.  Truly. This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano. He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming,  so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing. And this is a classic gaming emotion. Now, if you're not a gamer,  you might miss some of the nuance in this photo. You probably see the sense of urgency,  a little bit of fear, but intense concentration,  deep, deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem. If you are a gamer, you will notice a few nuances here:  the crinkle of the eyes up, and around the mouth  is a sign of optimism,  and the eyebrows up is surprise. This is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an "epic win." Oh, you've heard of that. OK, good, so we have some gamers among us. An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive,  you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it. It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination, and when you get there,  you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of. That's an epic win. This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win. And this is the face that we need to see  on millions of problem-solvers all over the world  as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century --  the face of someone who, against all odds,  is on the verge of an epic win. Now, unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems. This is what I call the "I'm Not Good At Life" face. This is actually me making it. Can you see? Yes. Good. This is me making the "I'm Not Good At Life" face. This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California, where I did my PhD  on why we're better in games than we are in real life. And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have. We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games. I don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it. We do achieve more in game worlds. But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters --  inspired to collaborate and to cooperate. And when we're in game worlds,  I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves --  the most likely to help at a moment's notice,  the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes,  to get up after failure and try again. And in real life, when we face failure,  when we confront obstacles, we often don't feel that way. We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed,  we feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynical. We never have those feelings when we're playing games,  they just don't exist in games. So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student. What about games makes it impossible  to feel that we can't achieve everything? How can we take those feelings from games  and apply them to real-world work? So I looked at games like World of Warcraft,  which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment. And I started to notice a few things  that make epic wins so possible in online worlds. The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games,  especially in World of Warcraft,  there are lots and lots of different characters  who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission, right away. But not just any mission,  it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game. Right? So you can do it. They never give you a challenge you can't achieve. But it is on the verge of what you're capable of, so you have to try hard. But there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft; no sitting around,  wringing your hands --  there's always something specific and important to be done. There are also tons of collaborators. Everywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people  ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission. That's not something we have in real life that easily,  this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators. And there's this epic story, this inspiring story of why we're there,  and what we're doing,  and we get all this positive feedback. You guys have heard of leveling up, +1 strength, +1 intelligence. We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life. When I get off this stage,  I'm not going to have +1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea,  +20 crazy idea. I don't get that feedback in real life. Now, the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft  is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time,  we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds. It's just better than reality. So, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers  have spent 5.93 million years  solving the virtual problems of Azeroth. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. It might sound like it's a bad thing. But to put that in context:  5.93 million years ago  was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up. That was the first upright primate. So when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games,  the only way it makes sense to even think about it  is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution,  which is an extraordinary thing. But it's also apt,  because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games,  we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings. We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species. This is true. I believe this. So, consider this really interesting statistic;  it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University:  The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture  will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games  by the age of 21. Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons. First of all, for children in the United States,  from fifth grade to high school graduation,  if you have perfect attendance. So, we have an entire parallel track of education going on,  where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer  as they're learning about everything else in school. Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book "Outliers,"  so you would have heard of his theory of success,  the "10,000 hours" theory of success. It's based on this great cognitive-science research  that says if we can master 10,000 hours  of effortful study at anything by the age of 21,  we will be virtuosos at it. We will be as good at whatever we do  as the greatest people in the world. And so, now what we're looking at  is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers. So, the big question is,  "What exactly are gamers getting so good at?" Because if we could figure that out,  we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands. This is how many people we now have in the world  who spend at least an hour a day playing online games. These are our virtuoso gamers,  500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something. And in the next decade,  we're going to have another billion gamers  who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is. If you don't know it already, this is coming. The game industry is developing consoles  that are low-energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet,  so that gamers all over the world,  particularly in India, China, Brazil, can get online. They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade. It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers. So I've started to think about  what these games are making us virtuosos at. Here are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optimism. OK, think of this as extreme self-motivation. Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately  to tackle an obstacle,  combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible,  and that it's always worth trying, and trying now. Gamers don't sit around. Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric. There's a lot of interesting research that shows  we like people better after we play a game with them,  even if they've beaten us badly. And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone. We trust that they will spend their time with us,  that they will play by the same rules,  value the same goal, stay with the game until it's over. And so, playing a game together  actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation. And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result. Blissful productivity. I love it. You know, there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer  plays for 22 hours a week -- kind of a half-time job. It's because we know, when we're playing a game,  than we are relaxing, or hanging out. We know that we are optimized as human beings,  to do hard and meaningful work. And gamers are willing to work hard all the time,  if they're given the right work. Finally: epic meaning. Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions  to human planetary-scale stories. So, just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective:  So, you all know Wikipedia, biggest wiki in the world. Second biggest wiki in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles,  Five million people use it every month. They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet  than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world. They are building an epic story. They are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft. Okay, so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing:  Gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals. These are people who believe that they are individually capable  of changing the world. And the only problem is,  they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds  and not the real world. That's the problem that I'm trying to solve. There's an economist named Edward Castronova. His work is brilliant. He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy  and money in online worlds. And he says, "We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus  to virtual worlds and online game environments." And he's an economist, so he's rational. And he says --   Not like me, I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant. But he says that this makes perfect sense,  because gamers can achieve more in online worlds  than they can in real life. They can have stronger social relationships in games  than they can have in real life;  they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games  than they do in real life. So he says, for now it makes perfect sense  for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world. Now, I also agree that that is rational, for now. But it is not, by any means, an optimal situation. We have to start making the real world work more like a game. I take my inspiration from something that happened  2,500 years ago. These are ancient dice, made out of sheep's knuckles. Before we had awesome game controllers,  we had sheep's knuckles. And these represent the first game equipment  designed by human beings,  and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,  you might know this history,  which is the history of who invented games and why. Herodotus says that games, particularly dice games,  were invented in the kingdom of Lydia,  during a time of famine. Apparently, there was such a severe famine  that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy. People were suffering. People were fighting. It was an extreme situation, they needed an extreme solution. So, according to Herodotus, they invented dice games,  and they set up a kingdom-wide policy:  On one day, everybody would eat,  and on the next day, everybody would play games. And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games,  because games are so engaging,  and immerse us in such satisfying, blissful productivity,  they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat. And then on the next day, they would play games;  and on the next day, they would eat. And according to Herodotus,  they passed 18 years this way, surviving through a famine,  by eating on one day, and playing games on the next. Now, this is exactly, I think, how we're using games today. We're using games to escape real-world suffering --  we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment,  everything that's not satisfying about real life,  and we're getting what we need from games. But it doesn't have to end there. This is really exciting. According to Herodotus, after 18 years the famine wasn't getting better,  so the king decided they would play one final dice game. They divided the entire kingdom in half. They played one dice game,  and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure. They would leave Lydia,  and they would go out in search of a new place to live,  leaving behind just enough people  to survive on the resources that were available,  and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive. Now, this sounds crazy, right? But recently, DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans,  who then led to the Roman Empire,  actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians. And so, recently, scientists have suggested  that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true. And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling  that lasted for nearly 20 years, that could have explained the famine. So this crazy story might be true. They might have actually saved their culture by playing games,  escaping to games for 18 years,  and then been so inspired,  and knew so much about how to come together with games,  that they actually saved the entire civilization that way. Okay, we can do that. We've been playing Warcraft since 1994. That was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series. That was 16 years ago. They played dice games for 18 years,  we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years. I say we are ready for our own epic game. Now, they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world,  so that's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from. Let's get half of us to agree  to spend an hour a day playing games,  until we solve real-world problems. Now, I know you're asking, "How are we going to solve real-world problems in games?" Well, that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years,  at the Institute for the Future. We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto,  and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future. We do not want to try to predict the future. What we want to do is make the future. We want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome,  and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality. We want to imagine epic wins,  and then give people the means to achieve the epic win. I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made  that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures. This is World Without Oil. We made this game in 2007. This is an online game  in which you try to survive an oil shortage. The oil shortage is fictional,  but we put enough online content out there  for you to believe that it's real,  and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil. So when you come to the game,  you sign up, tell us where you live,  and then we give you real-time news videos,  data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs,  what's not available, how food supply is being affected, how transportation is being affected,  if schools are closed, if there's rioting,  and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true. And then we ask you to blog about it,  to post videos, to post photos. We piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007,  and we've tracked them for the three years since. And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience. Nobody wants to change how they live,  just because it's good for the world, or because we're supposed to. But if you immerse them in an epic adventure  and tell them, "We've run out of oil. This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on. Challenge yourself to see how you would survive,"  most of our players have kept up the habits  that they learned in this game. So for the next world-saving game,  we decided to aim higher -- bigger problem than just peak oil. We did a game called Superstruct at the Institute for the Future. And the premise was, a supercomputer has calculated  that humans have only 23 years left on the planet. This supercomputer was called  the Global Extinction Awareness System, of course. We asked people to come online --  almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies, you form a dream team --  you've got the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-convict,  and they all have something to do to save the world. But in our game, instead of just having five people on the dream team,  we said, "Everybody's on the dream team,  and it's your job to invent the future of energy,  the future of food, the future of health,  the future of security and the future of the social safety net." We had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks. They came up with 500 insanely creative solutions  that you can go online, Google "Superstruct," and see. So, finally, the last game,  we're launching it March 3rd. This is a game done with the World Bank Institute. If you complete the game,  you will be certified by the World Bank Institute  as a Social Innovator, class of 2010. Working with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa,  and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills. We've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up  in skills like local insight, knowledge networking,  sustainability, vision and resourcefulness. I would like to invite all of you  to please share this game with young people,  anywhere in the world, particularly in developing areas,  who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world. So, I'm going to wrap up now. I want to ask a question. What do you think happens next? We've got all these amazing gamers, we've got these games  that are kind of pilots of what we might do,  but none of them have saved the real world yet. Well I hope you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource  that we can use to do real-world work,  that games are a powerful platform for change. We have all these amazing superpowers:  blissful productivity, the ability to weave a tight social fabric,  this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning. I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter,  to survive on this planet for another century. That's my hope, that you will join me in making and playing games like this. When I look forward to the next decade, I know two things for sure:  that we can make any future we can imagine,  and we can play any games we want, so I say:  Let the world-changing games begin. Thank you. 
For some time I have been interested in  the placebo effect,  which might seem like an odd thing  for a magician to be interested in,  unless you think of it in the terms that I do,  which is, "Something fake  is believed in enough by somebody  that it becomes something real." In other words, sugar pills  have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies,  the placebo effect,  just because the person thinks  that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical  or some sort of a --  for pain management, for example,  if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body  called the placebo effect. Something fake becomes  something real  because of someone's perception of it. In order for us to understand each other,  I want to start by showing you a rudimentary,  very simple magic trick. And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick  that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s. I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s. I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it. And then I'll explain why I explained it. So, here's what happens. The knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine. I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this. I'll get my sleeve back. And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve  I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here. That way you can see that at no time  can anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there  nothing can go up or down my sleeve. And the object of this is quite simple. I'm going to open my hand,  and hopefully, if all is well,  my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife. In fact it's held so tightly in place  that I can shake it,  and the knife does not come off. Nothing goes up or down my sleeve,  no trickery. And you can examine everything. Ta-da! So, this is a trick that I often teach to young children  that are interested in magic, because you can learn  a great deal about deception by studying  this very -- even though it's a very simple trick methodologically. Probably many of you in the room know this trick. What happens is this. I hold the knife in my hand. I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist  to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve,  that is a lie. The reason I'm holding onto my wrist  is because that's actually the secret  of the illusion. In a moment when my hand moves from facing you  to being away from you,  this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift  from where it is, to a position  pointing out like this. Nice one. Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there. So, it goes like this, from here, right. And as I move around my finger shifts. And we could talk about why this is deceptive,  why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here,  because the mind, and the way it processes information,  it doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them. But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up. Obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism,  but by chicanery,  my index finger being there. And then when I close my finger, same thing,  as I move back, this motion  kind of covers the moving back of my finger. I take this hand away. You give the knife out. There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks. Now,   what does that have to do with the placebo effect? I read a study a year or so ago  that really blew my mind wide open. I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me,  was an astonishing thing. It turns out that if you administer  a placebo in the form of a white pill,  that's like aspirin shaped --  it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect. But if you change the form that you give the placebo in,  like you make a smaller pill,  and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it,  it is actually measurably more effective. Even though neither one of these things  has any pharmaceutical -- they're sugar pills. But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill. What?  That really flipped me out. Turns out though, that that's not even where it stops. If you have capsules,  they're more effective than tablets in any form. A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other  is better than a white capsule. Dosage has something to do with this. One pill twice a day  is not as good at three pills --  I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry. But the point is ... ... these dosages have something to do with it. And the form has something to do with it. And if you want the ultimate in placebo,  you've go to the needle. Right? A syringe with some inert --  a couple CCs of some inert something,  and you inject this into a patient ... Well this is such a powerful image in their mind,  it's so much stronger than the white pill. It's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you  some other time when we have slides. The point is  the white pill is not as good as the blue pill  is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle. And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality,  it's only your belief that makes it real  in your body and makes a stronger effect. I wanted to see if I could take that idea  and apply it to a magic trick. And take something that is obviously a fake trick  and make it seem real. And we know from that study  that when you want reality, you go to the needle. This is a seven-inch hatpin. It's very, very sharp,  and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit. This is really my flesh. This is not  Damian's special-grown flesh. That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect. I'm going to pierce my skin  and run this needle through to the other side. If you're queasy --   if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends  in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know,  and one woman almost passed out. So, I suggest if you get queasy easy  that you look away for about the next 30 --  in fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it. You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to. So, here is what happens, right here,  the beginning of my flesh  at the lower part of my arm I just make  a little pierce. I'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out? OK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit,  and then out the other side like this. Now, essentially we're in the same position we were in  with the knife trick. But you can't count my fingers right now can you? So, let me show them to you. That's one, two  three, four, five. Yes, well... I know what people think when they see this. They go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough  to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes. So, let me give you a little peek. How's that look out there? Pretty good. Yeah, I know.   And the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that." People in the satellite room are starting to move in now. Let me give you good close look at this. That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect. That's my flesh, and I can twist that around. I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away,  don't look at the thing. People in the back or people on video years from now watching this  will go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neat  in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be --  see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding. Well let me work up some blood for you. Yes, there it is. Normally now, I would take the needle out. I would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds. But I think in this context  and with the idea of taking something fake  and making it into something real,  I'm just going to leave it there,  and walk off the stage. I will be seeing you several times over the next few days. I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much. 
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life. I've loved only two. That first one,  it was more like a passionate affair. It was a beautiful fish:  flavorful, textured, meaty,  a bestseller on the menu. What a fish. Even better,  it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards  of sustainability. So you could feel good about selling it. I was in a relationship with this beauty  for several months. One day, the head of the company called  and asked if I'd speak at an event  about the farm's sustainability. "Absolutely," I said. Here was a company trying to solve  what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs:  How do we keep fish on our menus? For the past 50 years,  we've been fishing the seas  like we clear-cut forests. It's hard to overstate the destruction. Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love --  the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish --  they've collapsed. There's almost nothing left. So, for better or for worse,  aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future. A lot of arguments against it:  Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway --  and they're inefficient. Take tuna,  a major drawback. It's got a feed conversion ratio  of 15 to one. That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish  to get you one pound of farm tuna. Not very sustainable. It doesn't taste very good either. So here, finally,  was a company trying to do it right. I wanted to support them. The day before the event,  I called the head of P.R. for the company. Let's call him Don. "Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous  for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute." "That's right," he said. "We're so far out,  the waste from our fish gets distributed,  not concentrated." And then he added,  "We're basically a world unto ourselves. That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said. "Best in the business." 2.5 to one, great. "2.5 what? What are you feeding?" "Sustainable proteins," he said. "Great," I said. Got off the phone. And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought:  What the hell is a sustainable protein? So the next day, just before the event, I called Don. I said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?" He said he didn't know. He would ask around. Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company;  no one could give me a straight answer  until finally, I got on the phone  with the head biologist. Let's call him Don too. "Don," I said,  "what are some examples of sustainable proteins?" Well, he mentioned some algaes  and some fish meals,  and then he said chicken pellets. I said, "Chicken pellets?" He said, "Yeah, feathers, skin,  bone meal, scraps,  dried and processed into feed." I said, "What percentage  of your feed is chicken?" Thinking, you know, two percent. "Well, it's about 30 percent," he said. I said, "Don, what's sustainable  about feeding chicken to fish?" There was a long pause on the line,  and he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world." I fell out of love with this fish. No, not because I'm some self-righteous,  goody-two shoes foodie. I actually am. No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God,  after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken. This second fish,  it's a different kind of love story. It's the romantic kind,  the kind where the more you get to know your fish,  you love the fish. I first ate it at a restaurant  in southern Spain. A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. She kind of set us up. It came to the table  a bright, almost shimmering, white color. The chef had overcooked it. Like twice over. Amazingly, it was still delicious. Who can make a fish taste good  after it's been overcooked? I can't,  but this guy can. Let's call him Miguel --  actually his name is Miguel. And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef,  at least in the way that you and I understand it. He's a biologist  at Veta La Palma. It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain. It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river. Until the 1980s,  the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. They raised beef cattle  on what was essentially wetlands. They did it by draining the land. They built this intricate series of canals,  and they pushed water off the land and out into the river. Well, they couldn't make it work,  not economically. And ecologically, it was a disaster. It killed like 90 percent of the birds,  which, for this place, is a lot of birds. And so in 1982,  a Spanish company with an environmental conscience  purchased the land. What did they do? They reversed the flow of water. They literally flipped the switch. Instead of pushing water out,  they used the channels to pull water back in. They flooded the canals. They created a 27,000-acre fish farm --  bass, mullet,  shrimp, eel --  and in the process, Miguel and this company  completely reversed the ecological destruction. The farm's incredible. I mean, you've never seen anything like this. You stare out at a horizon  that is a million miles away,  and all you see are flooded canals  and this thick, rich marshland. I was there not long ago with Miguel. He's an amazing guy,  like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. Okay? There we are slogging through the wetlands,  and I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees,  and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture. Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite. Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton. And here, here he sees a grouping pattern  that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe. It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career  in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. I asked him how he became  such an expert on fish. He said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish. I'm an expert in relationships." And then he's off, launching into more talk  about rare birds and algaes  and strange aquatic plants. And don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know,  the biotic community unplugged, kind of thing. It's great, but I was in love. And my head was swooning over that  overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. So I interrupted him. I said,  "Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?" He pointed at the algae. "I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton,  the relationships: It's amazing. But what are your fish eating? What's the feed conversion ratio?" Well, he goes on to tell me  it's such a rich system  that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild. The plant biomass, the phytoplankton,  the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish. The system is so healthy,  it's totally self-renewing. There is no feed. Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals? Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel,  and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural,  unlike like any farm I'd ever been at,  how do you measure success?" At that moment, it was as if  a film director called for a set change. And we rounded the corner  and saw the most amazing sight:  thousands and thousands of pink flamingos,  a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see. "That's success," he said. "Look at their bellies, pink. They're feasting." Feasting? I was totally confused. I said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?" "Yes," he said. "We lose 20 percent of our fish  and fish eggs to birds. Well, last year, this property  had 600,000 birds on it,  more than 250 different species. It's become, today, the largest  and one of the most important  private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe." I said, "Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population  like the last thing you want on a fish farm?" He shook his head, no. He said, "We farm extensively,  not intensively. This is an ecological network. The flamingos eat the shrimp. The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. So the pinker the belly,  the better the system." Okay, so let's review:  a farm that doesn't feed its animals,  and a farm that measures its success  on the health of its predators. A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary. Oh, and by the way, those flamingos,  they shouldn't even be there in the first place. They brood in a town  150 miles away,  where the soil conditions  are better for building nests. Every morning, they fly  150 miles into the farm. And every evening, they fly 150 miles back. They do that because they're able to follow  of highway A92. No kidding. I was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing,  so I looked at Miguel. I said, "Miguel, do they fly  150 miles to the farm,  and then do they fly  150 miles back at night? Do they do that for the children?" He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song. He said, "No; they do it because the food's better." I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish,  which was delicious -- and I don't like fish skin;  I don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy. It's that acrid, tar-like flavor. I almost never cook with it. Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain,  it tasted not at all like fish skin. It tasted sweet and clean,  like you were taking a bite of the ocean. I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded. He said, "The skin acts like a sponge. It's the last defense before anything enters the body. It evolved to soak up impurities." And then he added,  "But our water has no impurities." OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish,  a farm that measures its success  by the success of its predators. And then I realized when he says,  "A farm that has no impurities,"  he made a big understatement,  because the water that flows through that farm  comes in from the Guadalquivir River. It's a river that carries with it  all the things that rivers tend to carry these days:  chemical contaminants,  pesticide runoff. And when it works its way through the system  and leaves,  the water is cleaner than when it entered. The system is so healthy, it purifies the water. So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals,  not just a farm that measures its success  by the health of its predators,  but a farm that's literally a water purification plant --  and not just for those fish,  but for you and me as well. Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic. A drop in the ocean, I know,  but I'll take it, and so should you,  because this love story,  however romantic,  is also instructive. You might say it's a recipe  for the future of good food,  whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle. What we need now is  a radically new conception of agriculture,  one in which the food actually tastes good. But for a lot people,  that's a bit too radical. We're not realists, us foodies;  we're lovers. We love farmers' markets,  we love small family farms,  we talk about local food,  we eat organic. And when you suggest these are the things  that will ensure the future of good food,  someone, somewhere stands up and says,  "Hey guy, I love pink flamingos,  but how are you going to feed the world?" How are you going to feed the world? Can I be honest? I don't love that question. No, not because we already produce  enough calories to more than feed the world. One billion people will go hungry today. One billion -- that's more than ever before --  because of gross inequalities in distribution,  not tonnage. Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic  of our food system for the last 50 years. Feed grain to herbivores,  pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil,  chicken to fish,  and all along agribusiness  has simply asked,  "If we're feeding more people more cheaply,  how terrible could that be?" That's been the motivation,  it's been the justification:  it's been the business plan  of American agriculture. We should call it what it is:  a business in liquidation,  a business that's quickly eroding  ecological capital that makes that very production possible. That's not a business,  and it isn't agriculture. Our breadbasket is threatened today,  not because of diminishing supply,  but because of diminishing resources. Not by the latest combine and tractor invention,  but by fertile land;  not by pumps, but by fresh water;  not by chainsaws, but by forests;  and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea. Want to feed the world? Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves? Or better: How can we create conditions  that enable every community  to feed itself? To do that,  don't look at the agribusiness model for the future. It's really old, and it's tired. It's high on capital, chemistry and machines,  and it's never produced anything really good to eat. Instead, let's look to the ecological model. That's the one that relies on two billion years  of on-the-job experience. Look to Miguel,  farmers like Miguel. Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves;  farms that restore instead of deplete;  farms that farm extensively  instead of just intensively;  farmers that are not just producers,  but experts in relationships. Because they're the ones  that are experts in flavor, too. And if I'm going to be really honest,  they're a better chef than I'll ever be. You know, I'm okay with that,  because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious. Thank you. 
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction. In high school, I took a bus to school  an hour each way every day. And I was always absorbed in a book,  science fiction book,  which took my mind to other worlds,  and satisfied, in a narrative form,  this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had. And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself  in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school  I was out in the woods,  hiking and taking "samples" --  frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water --  and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope. You know, I was a real science geek. But it was all about trying to understand the world,  understand the limits of possibility. And my love of science fiction  actually seemed mirrored in the world around me,  because what was happening, this was in the late '60s,  we were going to the moon,  we were exploring the deep oceans. Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms  with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world  that we could never really have previously imagined. So, that seemed to resonate  with the whole science fiction part of it. And I was an artist. I could draw. I could paint. And I found that because there weren't video games  and this saturation of CG movies and all of this  imagery in the media landscape,  I had to create these images in my head. You know, we all did, as kids having to  read a book, and through the author's description,  put something on the movie screen in our heads. And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw  alien creatures, alien worlds,  robots, spaceships, all that stuff. I was endlessly getting busted in math class  doodling behind the textbook. That was -- the creativity  had to find its outlet somehow. And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows  actually got me very excited about the fact that there was  an alien world right here on Earth. I might not really go to an alien world  on a spaceship someday --  that seemed pretty darn unlikely. But that was a world I could really go to,  right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic  as anything that I had imagined from reading these books. So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver  at the age of 15. And the only problem with that was that I lived  in a little village in Canada,  600 miles from the nearest ocean. But I didn't let that daunt me. I pestered my father until he finally found  a scuba class in Buffalo, New York,  right across the border from where we live. in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter  in Buffalo, New York. And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,  until we moved to California. Since then, in the intervening  40 years,  I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,  and 500 hours of that was in submersibles. And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,  and even the shallow oceans,  are so rich with amazing life  that really is beyond our imagination. Nature's imagination is so boundless  meager human imagination. I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe  of what I see when I make these dives. And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,  and just as strong as it ever was. But when I chose a career as an adult,  it was filmmaking. And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile  this urge I had to tell stories  with my urges to create images. And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on. So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories  together, and that made sense. And of course the stories that I chose to tell  were science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens"  and "The Abyss." And with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love  of underwater and diving with filmmaking. So, you know, merging the two passions. Something interesting came out of "The Abyss,"  which was that to solve a specific narrative  problem on that film,  which was to create this kind of liquid water creature,  we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG. And this resulted in the first soft-surface  character, CG animation  that was ever in a movie. And even though the film didn't make any money --  barely broke even, I should say --  I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,  the global audience, was mesmerized  by this apparent magic. You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law  that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. They were seeing something magical. And so that got me very excited. And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced  into the cinematic art." So, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film,  we took that much farther. Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude  in that film. The success hung in the balance  on whether that effect would work. And it did, and we created magic again,  and we had the same result with an audience --  although we did make a little more money on that one. So, drawing a line through those two dots  of experience  came to, "This is going to be a whole new world,"  this was a whole new world of creativity  for film artists. So, I started a company with Stan Winston,  my good friend Stan Winston,  who is the premier make-up and creature designer  at that time, and it was called Digital Domain. And the concept of the company was  that we would leapfrog past  the analog processes of optical printers and so on,  and we would go right to digital production. And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while. But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s  in the creature and character design stuff  that we had actually founded the company to do. So, I wrote this piece called "Avatar,"  which was meant to absolutely push the envelope  of visual effects,  of CG effects, beyond,  with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG,  and the main characters would all be in CG,  and the world would be in CG. And the envelope pushed back,  and I was told by the folks at my company  that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while. So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks. You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:  "It's going to be this epic romance,  passionate film." Secretly, what I wanted to do was  I wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic." And that's why I made the movie. And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that. But I convinced them. I said,  "We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real. We'll be using it in the opening of the film. It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook." And I talked them into funding an expedition. Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme  about your imagination creating a reality. Because we actually created a reality where six months later,  I find myself in a Russian submersible  two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,  looking at the real Titanic through a view port. Not a movie, not HD -- for real. Now, that blew my mind. And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras  and lights and all kinds of things. But, it struck me how much  this dive, these deep dives,  was like a space mission. You know, where it was highly technical,  and it required enormous planning. You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark  hostile environment  if you can't get back by yourself. And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like,  living in a science fiction movie. This is really cool." And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration. Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it --  it was everything. It was adventure,  it was curiosity, it was imagination. Hollywood couldn't give me. Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could  create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing  out that window. As we did some of our subsequent expeditions,  I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents  and sometimes things that I had never seen before,  sometimes things that no one had seen before,  that actually were not described by science  at the time that we saw them and imaged them. So, I was completely smitten by this,  and had to do more. And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision. After the success of "Titanic,"  I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job  as a Hollywood movie maker,  and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while." And so, we started planning these  expeditions. And we wound up going to the Bismark,  and exploring it with robotic vehicles. We went back to the Titanic wreck. We took little bots that we had created  that spooled a fiber optic. And the idea was to go in and do an interior  survey of that ship, which had never been done. Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,  so we created technology to do it. So, you know, here I am now, on the deck  of Titanic, sitting in a submersible,  and looking out at planks that look much like this,  where I knew that the band had played. And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle  through the corridor of the ship. When I say, "I'm operating it,"  but my mind is in the vehicle. I felt like I was physically present  inside the shipwreck of Titanic. And it was the most surreal kind  of deja vu experience I've ever had,  because I would know before I turned a corner  what was going to be there before the lights  of the vehicle actually revealed it,  because I had walked the set for months  when we were making the movie. And the set was based as an exact replica  on the blueprints of the ship. So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience. And it really made me realize that  the telepresence experience --  that you actually can have these robotic avatars,  then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,  into this other form of existence. It was really, really quite profound. And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening  some decades out  as we start to have cyborg bodies  for exploration or for other means  in many sort of  post-human futures  that I can imagine,  So, having done these expeditions,  and really beginning to appreciate what was down there,  such as at the deep ocean vents  where we had these amazing, amazing animals -- they're basically aliens right here on Earth. They live in an environment of chemosynthesis. They don't survive on sunlight-based  system the way we do. And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to  water plumes. You think they can't possibly exist. At the same time  I was getting very interested in space science as well --  again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid. And I wound up getting involved with  the space community,  really involved with NASA,  sitting on the NASA advisory board,  planning actual space missions,  going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut  biomedical protocols,  and all these sorts of things,  to actually go and fly to the international space station  with our 3D camera systems. And this was fascinating. But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists  with us into the deep. And taking them down so that they had access --  astrobiologists, planetary scientists,  people who were interested in these extreme environments --  taking them down to the vents, and letting them see,  and take samples and test instruments, and so on. So, here we were making documentary films,  but actually doing science,  and actually doing space science. I'd completely closed the loop  between being the science fiction fan,  and doing this stuff for real. And you know, along the way in this journey  of discovery,  I learned a lot. I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot  about leadership. Now you think director has got to be a leader,  leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing. I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions. Because I had to, at a certain point, say,  "What am I doing out here? Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?" We don't make money at these damn shows. We barely break even. There is no fame in it. People sort of think I went away between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails  someplace, sitting at the beach. Made all these films, made all these documentary films  for a very limited audience. No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing? You're doing it for the task itself,  for the challenge --  and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is --  for the thrill of discovery, and for that strange bond that happens  when a small group of people form a tightly knit team. Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people,  working for years at a time,  sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time. And in that bond, you realize  that the most important thing  is the respect that you have for them  and that they have for you, that you've done a task  that you can't explain to someone else. When you come back to the shore and you say,  "We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,  and the this and the that,  all the technology of it, and the difficulty,  the human-performance aspects of working at sea,"  you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that  maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together  and they know they can never explain it. Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect. So, when I came back to make my next movie,  which was "Avatar,"  I tried to apply that same principle of leadership,  which is that you respect your team,  and you earn their respect in return. And it really changed the dynamic. So, here I was again with a small team,  in uncharted territory,  doing "Avatar," coming up with new technology  that didn't exist before. Tremendously exciting. Tremendously challenging. And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period. And it completely changed how I do movies. So, people have commented on how, "Well, you know,  you brought back the ocean organisms  and put them on the planet of Pandora." To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business,  the process itself, that changed as a result of that. So, what can we synthesize out of all this? You know, what are the lessons learned? Well, I think number one is  curiosity. It's the most powerful thing you own. Imagination is a force  that can actually manifest a reality. And the respect of your team  is more important than all the  laurels in the world. I have young filmmakers  come up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this." And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself,  don't bet against yourself,  and take risks." NASA has this phrase that they like:  "Failure is not an option." But failure has to be an option  in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith. And no important endeavor  that required innovation  was done without risk. You have to be willing to take those risks. So, that's the thought I would leave you with,  is that in whatever you're doing,  failure is an option,  but fear is not. Thank you. 
If I can leave you with one big idea today,  it's that the whole of the data  in which we consume  is greater that the sum of the parts,  and instead of thinking about information overload,  what I'd like you to think about is how  we can use information so that patterns pop  and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible. So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart  organized by age. This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment. It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do  is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents. And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges. This is because, in the mid-area here,  people are at their most active,  and over here they're at their most frail. We can step back out again  and then reorganize the data by cause of death,  seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer  are the usual suspects, but not for everyone. If we go ahead and we filter by age --  say 40 years or less --  we see that accidents are actually  the greatest cause that people have to be worried about. And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men. So you get the idea  that viewing information, viewing data in this way,  is a lot like swimming  in a living information info-graphic. And if we can do this for raw data,  why not do it for content as well? So what we have right here  is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated  It's all here; it's all on the web. You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk. With Pivot, you can drill into a decade. You can drill into a particular year. You can jump right into a specific issue. So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes  that have appeared in this issue, the sports. I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that,  which reveals, for me, all the issues  in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of. Now, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these,  I might think,  "Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?" So I can step back, and expand on that. And I see Greg LeMond now. And so you get the idea that when you  navigate over information this way --  going narrower, broader,  backing in, backing out --  you're not searching, you're not browsing. You're doing something that's actually a little bit different. It's in between, and we think it changes  the way information can be used. So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit  with something that's a little bit crazy. What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page  and we reduced it down to a little summary. So the summary consists of just a little synopsis  and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from. I'm only showing the top 500  most popular Wikipedia pages right here. But even in this limited view,  we can do a lot of things. Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains  that are most popular on Wikipedia. I'm going to go ahead and select government. Now, having selected government,  I can now see that the Wikipedia categories  that most frequently correspond to that  are Time magazine People of the Year. So this is really important because this is an insight  that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page. It's only possible to see that insight  when you step back and look at all of them. Looking at one of these particular summaries,  I can then drill into the concept of  Time magazine Person of the Year,  bringing up all of them. So looking at these people,  I can see that the majority come from government;  some have come from natural sciences;  some, fewer still, have come from business --  there's my boss --  and one has come from music. And interestingly enough,  Bono is also a TED Prize winner. So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners. So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time  as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page,  but at a higher level of abstraction. And so I want to show you one other thing  that may catch you a little bit by surprise. I'm just showing the New York Times website here. So Pivot, this application --  I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser,  but you can view web pages with it --  and we bring that zoomable technology  to every single web page like this. So I can step back,  pop right back into a specific section. Now the reason why this is important is because,  by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way,  I can look at my entire browsing history  in the exact same way. So I can drill into what I've done  over specific time frames. Here, in fact, is the state  of all the demo that I just gave. And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today. And, if I want to step back and look at everything,  I can slice and dice my history,  perhaps by my search history --  here, I was doing some nepotistic searching,  looking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot. And from these, I can drill into the web page  and just launch them again. It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times,  and in each case it makes the whole greater  than the sum of the parts with the data. So right now, in this world,  we think about data as being this curse. We talk about the curse of information overload. We talk about drowning in data. What if we can actually turn that upside down  and turn the web upside down,  so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next,  we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things,  and then being able to see the patterns  that were otherwise hidden? If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data,  we might actually extract information. And, instead of dealing just with information,  we can tease out knowledge. And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found. So with that, I thank you. 
Everybody talks about happiness these days. I had somebody count the number of books  with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years  and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more. There is a huge wave of interest in happiness,  among researchers. There is a lot of happiness coaching. Everybody would like to make people happier. But in spite of all this flood of work,  there are several cognitive traps  that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight  about happiness. And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps. This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,  and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,  because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is. The first of these traps  is a reluctance to admit complexity. It turns out that the word "happiness"  is just not a useful word anymore,  because we apply it to too many different things. I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,  but by and large,  this is something that we'll have to give up  and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view  of what well-being is. The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;  basically, it's between being happy in your life,  and being happy about your life  or happy with your life. And those are two very different concepts,  and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness. And the third is the focusing illusion,  and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance  that affects well-being  without distorting its importance. I mean, this is a real cognitive trap. There's just no way of getting it right. Now, I'd like to start with an example  of somebody who had a question-and-answer session  after one of my lectures reported a story,  and that was a story --  He said he'd been listening to a symphony,  and it was absolutely glorious music  and at the very end of the recording,  there was a dreadful screeching sound. And then he added, really quite emotionally,  it ruined the whole experience. But it hadn't. What it had ruined were the memories of the experience. He had had the experience. He had had 20 minutes of glorious music. They counted for nothing  because he was left with a memory;  the memory was ruined,  and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep. What this is telling us, really,  is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people  in terms of two selves. There is an experiencing self,  who lives in the present  and knows the present,  is capable of re-living the past,  but basically it has only the present. It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --  you know, when the doctor asks,  "Does it hurt now when I touch you here?" And then there is a remembering self,  and the remembering self is the one that keeps score,  and maintains the story of our life,  and it's the one that the doctor approaches  in asking the question,  "How have you been feeling lately?" or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that. Those are two very different entities,  the experiencing self and the remembering self,  and getting confused between them is part of the mess  about the notion of happiness. Now, the remembering self  is a storyteller. And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --  it starts immediately. We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. Our memory tells us stories,  that is, what we get to keep from our experiences  is a story. And let me begin with one example. This is an old study. Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,  but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s. They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds. Here are two patients,  those are their recordings. And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?" And it's a very easy question. Clearly, Patient B suffered more --  his colonoscopy was longer,  and every minute of pain that Patient A had,  Patient B had, and more. But now there is another question:  "How much did these patients think they suffered?" And here is a surprise. The surprise is that Patient A  had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy  than Patient B. The stories of the colonoscopies were different,  and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --  but one of them is this distinct ...   but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse  is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;  it's a bad story. How do we know that? Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy,  and much later, too,  "How bad was the whole thing, in total?" And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory. Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. From the point of view of the experiencing self,  clearly, B had a worse time. Now, what you could do with Patient A,  and we actually ran clinical experiments,  and it has been done, and it does work --  you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A  by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much. That will cause the patient  to suffer, but just a little  and much less than before. And if you do that for a couple of minutes,  you have made the experiencing self  of Patient A worse off,  and you have the remembering self of Patient A  a lot better off,  because now you have endowed Patient A  with a better story  about his experience. What defines a story? And that is true of the stories  that memory delivers for us,  and it's also true of the stories that we make up. What defines a story are changes,  significant moments and endings. Endings are very, very important  and, in this case, the ending dominated. Now, the experiencing self  lives its life continuously. It has moments of experience, one after the other. And you can ask: What happens to these moments? And the answer is really straightforward:  They are lost forever. I mean, most of the moments of our life --  and I calculated, you know, the psychological present  is said to be about three seconds long;  that means that, you know,  in a life there are about 600 million of them;  in a month, there are about 600,000 --  most of them don't leave a trace. Most of them are completely ignored  by the remembering self. And yet, somehow you get the sense  that they should count,  that what happens during these moments of experience  is our life. It's the finite resource that we're spending  And how to spend it  would seem to be relevant,  but that is not the story  that the remembering self keeps for us. So we have the remembering self  and the experiencing self,  and they're really quite distinct. The biggest difference between them  is in the handling of time. From the point of view of the experiencing self,  if you have a vacation,  and the second week is just as good as the first,  then the two-week vacation  is twice as good as the one-week vacation. That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self. For the remembering self, a two-week vacation  is barely better than the one-week vacation  because there are no new memories added. You have not changed the story. And in this way,  time is actually the critical variable  that distinguishes a remembering self  from an experiencing self;  time has very little impact on the story. Now, the remembering self does more  than remember and tell stories. It is actually the one that makes decisions  because, if you have a patient who has had, say,  two colonoscopies with two different surgeons  and is deciding which of them to choose,  then the one that chooses  is the one that has the memory that is less bad,  and that's the surgeon that will be chosen. The experiencing self  has no voice in this choice. We actually don't choose between experiences,  we choose between memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future,  we don't think of our future normally as experiences. We think of our future  as anticipated memories. And basically you can look at this,  you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,  and you can think of the remembering self  sort of dragging the experiencing self  through experiences that  the experiencing self doesn't need. I have that sense that  when we go on vacations  this is very frequently the case;  that is, we go on vacations,  to a very large extent,  in the service of our remembering self. And this is a bit hard to justify I think. I mean, how much do we consume our memories? That is one of the explanations  that is given for the dominance  of the remembering self. And when I think about that, I think about a vacation  we had in Antarctica a few years ago,  which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,  and I think of it relatively often,  relative to how much I think of other vacations. And I probably have consumed  my memories of that three-week trip, I would say,  for about 25 minutes in the last four years. Now, if I had ever opened the folder  with the 600 pictures in it,  I would have spent another hour. Now, that is three weeks,  and that is at most an hour and a half. There seems to be a discrepancy. Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,  in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,  but even if you do more of this,  there is a genuine question:  Why do we put so much weight on memory  relative to the weight that we put on experiences? So I want you to think  about a thought experiment. Imagine that for your next vacation,  you know that at the end of the vacation  all your pictures will be destroyed,  and you'll get an amnesic drug  so that you won't remember anything. Now, would you choose the same vacation?   And if you would choose a different vacation,  there is a conflict between your two selves,  and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,  and it's actually not at all obvious, because  if you think in terms of time,  then you get one answer,  and if you think in terms of memories,  you might get another answer. Why do we pick the vacations we do  is a problem that confronts us  with a choice between the two selves. Now, the two selves  bring up two notions of happiness. There are really two concepts of happiness  that we can apply, one per self. So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self? And then you would ask: How happy are the moments  in the experiencing self's life? And they're all -- happiness for moments  is a fairly complicated process. What are the emotions that can be measured? And, by the way, now we are capable  of the happiness of the experiencing self over time. If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,  it's a completely different thing. This is not about how happily a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is  when that person thinks about her life. Very different notion. Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions  is going to mess up the study of happiness,  and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,  who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time  in precisely this way. The distinction between the  happiness of the experiencing self  and the satisfaction of the remembering self  has been recognized in recent years,  and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. The Gallup Organization has a world poll  where more than half a million people  have been asked questions  about what they think of their life  and about their experiences,  and there have been other efforts along those lines. So in recent years, we have begun to learn  about the happiness of the two selves. And the main lesson I think that we have learned  is they are really different. You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,  and that really doesn't teach you much  about how happily they're living their life,  and vice versa. Just to give you a sense of the correlation,  the correlation is about .5. What that means is if you met somebody,  and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,"  how much would you know about his height? Well, you would know something about his height,  but there's a lot of uncertainty. You have that much uncertainty. If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,  you have a lot of uncertainty  about how happy they are  with their experiencing self. So the correlation is low. We know something about what controls  satisfaction of the happiness self. We know that money is very important,  goals are very important. We know that happiness is mainly  being satisfied with people that we like,  spending time with people that we like. There are other pleasures, but this is dominant. So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,  you are going to end up  doing very different things. The bottom line of what I've said here  is that we really should not think of happiness  as a substitute for well-being. It is a completely different notion. Now, very quickly,  another reason we cannot think straight about happiness  is that we do not attend to the same things  when we think about life, and we actually live. So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,  you are not going to get to the correct answer. When you ask that question,  you think people must be happier in California  if, say, you live in Ohio. And what happens is  when you think about living in California,  you are thinking of the contrast  between California and other places,  and that contrast, say, is in climate. Well, it turns out that climate  is not very important to the experiencing self  and it's not even very important to the reflective self  that decides how happy people are. But now, because the reflective self is in charge,  you may end up -- some people may end up  moving to California. And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen  to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier. Well, their experiencing self  is not going to get happier. We know that. But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,  because, when they think about it,  they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,  and they will feel they made the right decision. to think straight about well-being,  and I hope I have given you a sense  of how difficult it is. Thank you. Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you. Thank you so much. Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,  you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result  came out of that Gallup survey. Is that something you can share  since you do have a few moments left now? Daniel Kahneman: Sure. I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey  is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find. We found that with respect to the happiness  of the experiencing self. When we looked at how feelings,  vary with income. And it turns out that, below an income  of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --  and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,  so it's a large representative sample --  below an income of 600,000 dollars a year... CA: 60,000. DK: 60,000. 60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,  and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. Above that, we get an absolutely flat line. I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat. Clearly, what is happening is  money does not buy you experiential happiness,  but lack of money certainly buys you misery,  and we can measure that misery  very, very clearly. In terms of the other self, the remembering self,  you get a different story. The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are. That does not hold for emotions. CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about  life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. If people took seriously that finding,  I mean, it seems to turn upside down  everything we believe about, like for example,  taxation policy and so forth. Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,  would take a finding like that seriously  and run public policy based on it? DK: You know I think that there is recognition  of the role of happiness research in public policy. The recognition is going to be slow in the United States,  no question about that,  but in the U.K., it is happening,  and in other countries it is happening. People are recognizing that they ought  to be thinking of happiness  when they think of public policy. It's going to take a while,  and people are going to debate  whether they want to study experience happiness,  or whether they want to study life evaluation,  so we need to have that debate fairly soon. How to enhance happiness  goes very different ways depending on how you think,  and whether you think of the remembering self  or you think of the experiencing self. This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come. In the United States, efforts are being made  to measure the experience happiness of the population. This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,  part of national statistics. CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be --  the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years. Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics. Thank you, Danny Kahneman. 
I'm going to talk today about energy and climate. And that might seem a bit surprising because  my full-time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds,  about the things that we need to invent and deliver  to help the poorest two billion live better lives. But energy and climate are extremely important to these people --  in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet. The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow:  There will be too much rain, not enough rain,  things will change in ways  that their fragile environment simply can't support. And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest. So, the climate changes will be terrible for them. Also, the price of energy is very important to them. In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of,  to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy. Now, the price of energy has come down over time. Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution,  and, even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity,  and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning,  we can make modern materials and do so many things. And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. But, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap --  we need to meet a new constraint,  and that constraint has to do with CO2. CO2 is warming the planet,  and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one. If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,  that leads to a temperature increase,  and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects:  the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects,  in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes,  and so you get ecosystem collapses. Now, the exact amount of how you map  from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be  and where the positive feedbacks are,  there's some uncertainty there, but not very much. And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be,  but they will be extremely bad. I asked the top scientists on this several times:  Do we really have to get down to near zero? Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter? And the answer is that until we get near to zero,  the temperature will continue to rise. And so that's a big challenge. It's very different than saying "We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,  and we can just sort of squeeze under." This is something that has to get to zero. Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year,  over 26 billion tons. For each American, it's about 20 tons;  for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton. It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. And, somehow, we have to make changes  that will bring that down to zero. It's been constantly going up. It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all,  so we have to go from rapidly rising  to falling, and falling all the way to zero. This equation has four factors,  a little bit of multiplication:  So, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,  and that's going to be based on the number of people,  the services each person's using on average,  the energy on average for each service,  and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy. So, let's look at each one of these  and see how we can get this down to zero. Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. Now that's back from high school algebra,  but let's take a look. First, we've got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,  health care, reproductive health services,  we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent,  but there we see an increase of about 1.3. The second factor is the services we use. This encompasses everything:  the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating. These are very good things:  getting rid of poverty means providing these services  to almost everyone on the planet. And it's a great thing for this number to go up. In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,  we probably could cut back and use less,  but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up,  and so, over all, that will more than double  the services delivered per person. Here we have a very basic service:  Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework? And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out  and reading their school work under the street lamps. Now, efficiency, E, the energy for each service,  here finally we have some good news. We have something that's not going up. Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,  through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings --  there are a lot of services where you can bring  the energy for that service down quite substantially. Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent. There are other services like how we make fertilizer,  or how we do air transport,  where the rooms for improvement are far, far less. And so, overall here, if we're optimistic,  we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six. But for these first three factors now,  we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,  and that just won't cut it. So let's look at this fourth factor --  this is going to be a key one --  and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy. And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero? If you burn coal, no. If you burn natural gas, no. Almost every way we make electricity today,  except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2. And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale,  is create a new system. And so, we need energy miracles. Now, when I use the term "miracle," I don't mean something that's impossible. The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle. The Internet and its services are a miracle. So, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. Usually, we don't have a deadline,  where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't. This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed  and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline. Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this? Is there some kind of natural illustration,  some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?" I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos,  and somehow people enjoyed that. It really got them involved in the idea of,  you know, there are people who live with mosquitos. So, with energy, all I could come up with is this. I decided that releasing fireflies  would be my contribution to the environment here this year. So here we have some natural fireflies. I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar. Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one,  but they don't really add up to much. We need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability,  and, although there's many directions people are seeking,  I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers. I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels. Those may make some contribution,  and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better,  but my key point here  is that we're going to have to work on each of these five,  and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,  because they all have significant challenges. Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels,  either burning coal or burning natural gas. What you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not,  and that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue,  pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere, and hope it stays there. Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level,  but getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky,  and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard,  but the toughest one here is this long-term issue. Who's going to be sure? Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger  than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things? This is a lot of volume. So that's a tough one. Next would be nuclear. It also has three big problems:  Cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high;  the issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong,  that, even though you have these human operators,  that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons. And then what do you do with the waste? And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that. People need to feel good about it. So three very tough problems that might be solvable,  and so, should be worked on. The last three of the five, I've grouped together. These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel --  they have some disadvantages. One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies  is dramatically less than a power plant. This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles,  thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant. Also, these are intermittent sources. The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day,  and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time. And so, if you depend on these sources,  you have to have some way of getting the energy  during those time periods that it's not available. So, we've got big cost challenges here,  we have transmission challenges:  for example, say this energy source is outside your country;  you not only need the technology,  but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere. And, finally, this storage problem. And, to dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at  all the types of batteries that get made --  for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything --  and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses,  and what I found is that all the batteries we make now  could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy. And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here,  something that's going to be a factor of 100 better  than the approaches we have now. It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing. Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source  to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using. If you're counting on it for 100 percent,  you need an incredible miracle battery. Now, how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach? Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there? Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundreds. In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people. And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "They're crazy." That's good. And, I think, here in the TED group,  we have many people who are already pursuing this. Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar  that has some great solar thermal technologies. Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies  that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities,  and I'm trying to help back that. Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company  that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach. There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid. And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago,  so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising. The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium --  the one percent, which is the U235 --  we decided, "Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238." It is kind of a crazy idea. In fact, people had talked about it for a long time,  but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not,  and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers  that now you can simulate and see that, yes,  with the right material's approach, this looks like it would work. And, because you're burning that 99 percent,  you have greatly improved cost profile. You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel  all the leftover waste from today's reactors. So, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing. It breathes this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle. You can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem. I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky. This is the leftover, the 99 percent,  where they've taken out the part they burn now,  so it's called depleted uranium. That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years. And, simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process,  you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet. So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead,  but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas  that we need to move forward. So let's think: How should we measure ourselves? What should our report card look like? Well, let's go out to where we really need to get,  and then look at the intermediate. For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction. That really is very important, that we get there. And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries,  still some agriculture,  hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry, cement. So, to get to that 80 percent,  the developed countries, including countries like China,  will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether. So, the other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology,  have we deployed it in all the developed countries  and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere? That's super important. That's a key element of making that report card. So, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like? Well, again, it should have the two elements. We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions:  The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2,  and, therefore, the less the temperature. But in some ways, the grade we get there,  doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions,  is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other,  which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs. These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed,  and we can measure that in terms of companies,  pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed. There's a lot of great books that have been written about this. The Al Gore book, "Our Choice"  and the David McKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air." They really go through it and create a framework  that this can be discussed broadly,  because we need broad backing for this. There's a lot that has to come together. So this is a wish. It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years --  I could pick who's president,  I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love,  or I could pick that this thing  that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented --  this is the wish I would pick. This is the one with the greatest impact. If we don't get this wish,  the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible,  between the U.S. and China, between poor countries and rich,  and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse. So, what do we have to do? What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive? We need to go for more research funding. When countries get together in places like Copenhagen,  they shouldn't just discuss the CO2. They should discuss this innovation agenda,  and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending  on these innovative approaches. We do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade --  something that gets that price signal out there. We need to get the message out. We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue,  including the steps that the government takes. This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower, right --  I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is? Bil Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer,  hire all the great scientists, which we've done,  that's only tens of millions,  and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor  to make sure that our materials work properly,  then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions. The tough thing is building the pilot reactor;  finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location  that will actually build the first one of these. Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised,  then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density,  are so different than nuclear as we know it. CA: And so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground  almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel,  of this sort of spent uranium,  and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down? BG: That's right. Today, you're always refueling the reactor,  so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong:  that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out, that's not good. So, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in --  just think of it as a log --  put it down and not have those same complexities. And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done. CA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution. BG: Yeah. Well, what happens with the waste,  you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach --  then you can actually take that,  and put it into another one and burn that. And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today,  that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors --  that's our fuel to begin with. So, the thing that's been a problem from those reactors  is actually what gets fed into ours,  and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically  as you're going through this process. CA: I mean, you're talking to different people around the world  about the possibilities here. Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this? BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place,  and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called "nuclear,"  so we've got a lot of interest,  that people from the company have been in Russia, India, China --  I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here,  talking about how this fits into the energy agenda. So I'm optimistic. You know, the French and Japanese have done some work. This is a variant on something that has been done. It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor,  and a lot of countries have built them,  so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built. CA: So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood  of actually taking something like this live? BG: Well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things  that's very cheap,  we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy. That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models  have shown us that we have to meet. And, you know, TerraPower, if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot --  could easily meet that. And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies --  we need it to be hundreds --  who, likewise, if their science goes well,  if the funding for their pilot plants goes well,  that they can compete for this. And it's best if multiple succeed,  because then you could use a mix of these things. We certainly need one to succeed. CA: In terms of big-scale possible game changes,  is this the biggest that you're aware of out there? BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing. It would have been, even without the environmental constraint,  but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. In the nuclear space, there are other innovators. You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one,  but the modular people, that's a different approach. There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard,  but maybe they say that about us. And so, there are different ones,  but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium  has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal,  and so -- if you can deal with the negatives,  which are essentially the radiation --  the footprint and cost, the potential,  in terms of effect on land and various things,  is almost in a class of its own. CA: If this doesn't work, then what? Do we have to start taking emergency measures  to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable? BG: If you get into that situation,  it's like if you've been over-eating, and you're about to have a heart attack:  Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something. There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering,  which are various techniques that would delay the heating  to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together. Now, that's just an insurance policy. You hope you don't need to do that. Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy  because it might make you lazy,  that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you. I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem,  but there's now the geoengineering discussion  about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster,  or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect? CA: Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them,  how might you persuade them that they're wrong? BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps. The ones who make scientific arguments are very few. Are they saying that there's negative feedback effects  that have to do with clouds that offset things? There are very, very few things that they can even say  there's a chance in a million of those things. The main problem we have here, it's kind of like AIDS. You make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later. And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems,  the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later,  and a somewhat uncertain pain thing --  in fact, the IPCC report, that's not necessarily the worst case,  and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC  and say, "OK, that isn't that big of a deal." The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic,  and meet the CO2 constraints,  then the skeptics say, "OK,  I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2,  I kind of wish it did put out CO2,  but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before." CA: And so, that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument,  that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem,  it's going to take away all your other goals  of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth,  it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that  when there are better things we can do. BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&amp;D piece --  say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now --  it's not that dramatic. It shouldn't take away from other things. The thing you get into big money on, and this, reasonable people can disagree,  is when you have something that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that --  that, to me, mostly is a waste. Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve  and it's going to get very cheap,  I believe we should try more things that have a potential  to be far less expensive. If the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive,"  then the rich can afford that. I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy  and not change our lifestyle. The disaster is for that two billion. And even Lomborg has changed. His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&amp;D getting more discussed?" He's still, because of his earlier stuff,  still associated with the skeptic camp,  but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp,  and so, he's making the R&amp;D point. And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate. The R&amp;D piece, it's crazy how little it's funded. CA: Well Bill, I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here  to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much. BG: Thank you. 
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago  while writing an article for Italian Wired. I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything,  but I'd already finished editing the piece,  and I realized that I had never once in my life  looked up the word "disabled" to see what I'd find. Let me read you the entry. "Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked,  stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated,  run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped,  senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in  cracked-up, counted-out;  see also hurt, useless and weak. Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable." I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing,  it was so ludicrous,  but I'd just gotten past "mangled," and my voice broke,  and I had to stop and collect myself  from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed. You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus  so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right? But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,  when I would have been starting primary school  and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit  and as related to the other kids and the world around me. And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then. I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world  that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,  when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures  my life has procured. So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition,  expecting to find a revision worth noting. Here's the updated version of this entry. Unfortunately, it's not much better. I find the last two words under "Near Antonyms," particularly unsettling:  "whole" and "wholesome." So, it's not just about the words. It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words. It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values. Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world  and how we view other people. In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,  believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,  because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence. So, what reality do we want to call into existence:  a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered? By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,  we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power. Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead? One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor  at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware. His name was Dr. Pizzutillo,  an Italian American, whose name, apparently,  was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce,  so he went by Dr. P. And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties  and had the very perfect disposition to work with children. I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital,  with the exception of my physical therapy sessions. I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises  with these thick, elastic bands -- different colors,  you know -- to help build up my leg muscles,  and I hated these bands more than anything --  I hated them, had names for them. I hated them. And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child,  with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises,  unsuccessfully, of course. And, one day, he came in to my session --  exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions --  and he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl,  I think you're going to break one of those bands. When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks." Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part  to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do  before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward,  but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence  into a new and promising experience for me. And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision  and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl  shaped my own view of myself  as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future. This is an example of how adults in positions of power  can ignite the power of a child. But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries,  our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want,  the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable. Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society,  Certainly, from a medical standpoint,  my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,  titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies  that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,  and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them --  not to mention social networking platforms  allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves, so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing. So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now  what has always been a truth:  that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,  and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset. The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,  because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,  and I'm going to make an admission:  This phrase never sat right with me,  and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,  and I think I'm starting to figure out why. Implicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity"  is the idea that success, or happiness,  is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience  unscathed or unmarked by the experience,  as if my successes in life have come about from an ability  to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,  or what other people perceive as my disability. But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,  whether physically, emotionally or both. And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing. Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around  in order to resume living our life. It's part of our life. And I tend to think of it like my shadow. Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,  but it's always with me. And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle. There is adversity and challenge in life,  and it's all very real and relative to every single person,  but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,  but how you're going to meet it. So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,  but preparing them to meet it well. And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt. There's an important difference and distinction  between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee  and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled. And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront  is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions. In our desire to protect those we care about  by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,  or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,  we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall  that will actually disable someone. Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself. By not treating the wholeness of a person,  by not acknowledging their potency,  we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have. We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community. So we need to see through the pathology  and into the range of human capability. And, most importantly, there's a partnership  between those perceived deficiencies  and our greatest creative ability. So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times  as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,  but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity. So maybe the idea I want to put out there is  not so much overcoming adversity  as it is opening ourselves up to it,  embracing it,  grappling with it,  to use a wrestling term,  maybe even dancing with it. And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,  we're less burdened by the presence of it. This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,  and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,  that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character. To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,  nor is it the most intelligent that survives;  it is the one that is most adaptable to change. Conflict is the genesis of creation. From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that  the human ability to survive and flourish  is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict  into transformation. So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill. And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of. Maybe that's what adversity gives us:  a sense of self, a sense of our own power. So, we can give ourselves a gift. We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times. Maybe we can see it as change. Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet. I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves  is this idea of normalcy. Now, who's normal? There's no normal. There's common, there's typical. There's no normal,  and would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed? I don't think so. If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy  to one of possibility -- or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous --  we can release the power of so many more children,  and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community. Anthropologists tell us that the one thing  we as humans have always required of our community members  is to be of use, to be able to contribute. There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago,  carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury,  and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people  proved of value to the community. They didn't view these people as broken and useless;  they were seen as rare and valuable. A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up  in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania,  and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes. It was summertime: I had shorts on. I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins." And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is. And I said, "I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you." He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me. I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb." Oh, that guy. And, but of course, actually, it did click. This man was Dr. Kean,  a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day,  because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks. And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation,  so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents. And, because I was born without the fibula bones,  and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that,  he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news. He said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents  that you would never walk,  and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have  or any kind of life of independence,  and you've been making liar out of me ever since." The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved  newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood,  whether winning a second grade spelling bee,  marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade,  winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories,  and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,  med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School. And he called this part of the course the X Factor,  the potential of the human will. No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be  as a determinant in the quality of someone's life. And Dr. Kean went on to tell me,  he said, "In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise,  and even if given a modicum of support,  if left to their own devices, a child will achieve." See, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking. He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition  and what someone might do with it. And there's been a shift in my thinking over time,  in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old,  if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs,  I wouldn't have hesitated for a second. I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then. But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure. And it's because of the experiences I've had with them,  not in spite of the experiences I've had with them. And perhaps this shift in me has happened  because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me. See, all you really need is one person  to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off. If you can hand somebody the key to their own power --  the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment,  you are educating them in the best sense. You're teaching them to open doors for themselves. In fact, the exact meaning of the word "educate"  comes from the root word "educe." It means "to bring forth what is within,  to bring out potential." So again, which potential do we want to bring out? There was a case study done in 1960s Britain,  when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools. It's called the streaming trials. We call it "tracking" here in the States. It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on. And the "A students" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc. Well, they took, over a three-month period,  D-level students, gave them A's,  told them they were "A's," told them they were bright,  and at the end of this three-month period,  they were performing at A-level. And, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study,  is that they took the "A students" and told them they were "D's." And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period. Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out. A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too. The teachers didn't know a switch had been made. They were simply told, "These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'"  And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them. So, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit,  a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope,  it doesn't see beauty,  it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity  and our innate ability to imagine. If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope,  to see beauty in themselves and others,  to be curious and imaginative,  then we are truly using our power well. When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities  and new ways of being. I'd like to leave you with a poem  by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz  that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about,  and the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words":  "Every child has known God,  not the God of names,  not the God of don'ts,  but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them,  saying, 'Come dance with me. Come, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'"  Thank you. 
You know, what I do is write for children,  and I'm probably America's  most widely read children's author, in fact. And I always tell people  that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist. You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,  and no one has ever chose farmer. I'm here today to talk to you  about circles and epiphanies. And you know, an epiphany  is usually something you find that you dropped someplace. You've just got to go around the block  to see it as an epiphany. That's a painting of a circle. A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke. It's the kind of complicated circle  that I'm going to tell you about. My circle began back in the '60s  in high school in Stow, Ohio  where I was the class queer. I was the guy beaten up bloody  every week in the boys' room,  until one teacher saved my life. She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom  in the teachers' lounge. She did it in secret. She did it for three years. And I had to get out of town. I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,  and I ended up in San Francisco, California --  met a lover --  and back in the '80s, found it necessary  to begin work on AIDS organizations. About three or four years ago,  I got a phone call in the middle of the night  from that teacher, Mrs. Posten,  who said, "I need to see you. I'm disappointed  that we never got to know each other as adults. Could you please come to Ohio,  and please bring that man  that I know you have found by now. And I should mention  that I have pancreatic cancer,  and I'd like you to please  be quick about this." Well, the next day we were in Cleveland. We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,  and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice. We found her one, we got her there,  and we took care of her  and watched over her family,  because it was necessary. It's something we knew how to do. And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult  got to know me,  she turned into a box of ashes  and was placed in my hands. And what had happened  was the circle had closed,  it had become a circle --  and that epiphany I talked about  presented itself. The epiphany is  that death is a part of life. She saved my life;  I and my partner saved hers. And you know, that part of life needs everything  that the rest of life does. It needs truth and beauty,  and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today. It also needs --  it needs dignity,  love and pleasure,  and it's our job to hand those things out. Thank you. 
As an artist,  connection is very important to me. Through my work I'm trying to articulate  that humans are not separate from nature  and that everything is interconnected. I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago,  where I saw my first icebergs. I was in awe. My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy,  trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me. The icebergs around me  were almost 200 feet out of the water,  and I could only help but wonder  that this was one snowflake  on top of another snowflake,  year after year. Icebergs are born  when they calve off of glaciers  or break off of ice shelves. Each iceberg has its own individual personality. They have a distinct way  of interacting with their environment  and their experiences. Some refuse to give up  and hold on to the bitter end,  while others can't take it anymore  and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion. It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg,  that they're isolated,  that they're separate and alone,  much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves. But the reality is far from it. As an iceberg melts,  I am breathing in  its ancient atmosphere. As the iceberg melts,  it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water  that nourishes many forms of life. I approach photographing these icebergs  as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors,  knowing that in these individual moments  they exist in that way  and will never exist that way again. It is not a death when they melt;  it is not an end,  but a continuation  of their path through the cycle of life. Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young --  a couple thousand years old. And some of the ice  is over 100,000 years old. The last pictures I'd like to show you  are of an iceberg that I photographed  in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland. It's a very rare occasion  that you get to actually witness  an iceberg rolling. So here it is. You can see on the left side a small boat. That's about a 15-foot boat. And I'd like you to pay attention  to the shape of the iceberg  and where it is at the waterline. You can see here, it begins to roll,  and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there. This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg. It's about 120 feet above the water,  or 40 meters. And this video is real time. And just like that,  the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality. Thank you. 
I want you to imagine two couples  in the middle of 1979  on the exact same day, at the exact same moment,  each conceiving a baby -- okay? So two couples each conceiving one baby. Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception,  because if you spend all that time imagining that conception,  you're not going to listen to me. So just imagine that for a moment. And in this scenario,  I want to imagine that, in one case,  the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,  meeting that X chromosome of the egg. And in the other case,  the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,  meeting the X chromosome of the egg. Both are viable; both take off. We'll come back to these people later. So I wear two hats  in most of what I do. As the one hat,  I do history of anatomy. I'm a historian by training,  and what I study in that case  is the way that people have dealt with anatomy --  meaning human bodies, animal bodies --  how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies;  how have they thought about bodies. The other hat that I've worn in my work  is as an activist,  as a patient advocate --  or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate --  for people who are patients of doctors. In that case, what I've worked with  is people who have body types  that challenge social norms. So some of what I've worked on, for example,  is people who are conjoined twins --  two people within one body. Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism --  so people who are much shorter than typical. And a lot of what I've worked on  is people who have atypical sex --  so people who don't have the standard male  or the standard female body types. And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this. Intersex comes in a lot of different forms. I'll just give you a few examples  of the types of ways you can have sex  that isn't standard for male or female. So in one instance,  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome  tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,  to become testes. And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone. But because this individual lacks receptors  to hear that testosterone,  the body doesn't react to the testosterone. And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome. So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it. As a consequence, the body develops  more along the female typical path. When the child is born, she looks like a girl. She is a girl. She is raised as a girl. And it's often not until she hits puberty  and she's growing and developing breasts,  but she's not getting her period,  that somebody figures out something's up here. And they do some tests and figure out  that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,  she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome. Now what's important to understand  is you may think of this person as really being male,  but they're really not. Females, like males,  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands. They're in the back of our body. And the adrenal glands make androgens,  which are a masculinizing hormone. Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female --  I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up  but I think I'm probably typical --  most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive. We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens. The consequence is that somebody like me  has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens  than the woman born with testes  who has androgen insensitivity syndrome. So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people  are in the middle of all the sex spectrum --  in some ways, they can be all over the place. Another example:  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,  who was born a boy, raised a boy,  had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,  had a life as a guy  and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside. What he had was an extreme form  of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. He had XX chromosomes,  and in the womb,  his adrenal glands were in such high gear  that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment. And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed,  his brain was subject  to the more typical masculine component of hormones. And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything. And it was only when he had reached the age of 19  that he began to have enough medical problems  actually from menstruating internally,  that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally. Okay, so just one more quick example  of a way you can have intersex. Some people who have XX chromosomes  develop what are called ovotestis,  which is when you have ovarian tissue  with testicular tissue wrapped around it. And we're not exactly sure why that happens. So sex can come in lots of different varieties. The reason  that children with these kinds of bodies --  whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,  or it's an intersex type --  are often normalized by surgeons  is not because it actually leaves them better off  in terms of physical health. In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy. The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries  is because they threaten our social categories. Or system has been based typically on the idea  that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity. So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman  is to have a female identity;  what it means to be a black person is, allegedly,  is to have an African anatomy  in terms of your history. And so we have this terribly simplistic idea. And when we're faced with a body  that actually presents us something quite different,  it startles us in terms of those categorizations. So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture  about individualism. And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism. Well you can imagine how startling then it is  when you have children that are born  who are two people inside of one body. Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently  was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya,  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin. I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,  "Which is the test they're going to run  that will tell us whether or not  Caster Semenya is male or female?" And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test. In fact, we now know  that sex is complicated enough  that we have to admit  nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,  or between male and intersex and female and intersex;  we actually draw that line on nature. So what we have is a sort of situation  where the farther our science goes,  the more we have to admit to ourselves  that these categories  that we thought of as stable anatomical categories  that mapped very simply  to stable identity categories  are a lot more fuzzy than we thought. And it's not just in terms of sex. It's also in terms of race,  which turns out to be vastly more complicated  than our terminology has allowed. As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas. We look, for example, about the fact  that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA  with chimpanzees. What are we to make of the fact  that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides? And as we get farther and farther with our science,  we get more and more into a discomforted zone  where we have to acknowledge  that the simplistic categories we've had  are probably overly simplistic. So we're seeing this  in all sorts of places in human life. One of the places we're seeing it, for example,  in our culture today, in the United States today,  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life. We have difficult conversations  about at what point we decide a body becomes a human,  such that it has a different right than a fetal life. We have very difficult conversations nowadays --  probably not out in the open as much as within medicine --  about the question of when somebody's dead. In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much  At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose,  and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet. If it stopped twitching, you bury them. But today, we have a situation  where we want to take vital organs out of beings  and give them to other beings. And as a consequence,  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question  about who's dead,  and this leads us to a really difficult situation  where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before. Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories  would make somebody like me really happy. I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies,  but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous. Understanding that these categories  are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense. And it makes me tense  from the point of view of thinking about democracy. So in order to tell you about that tension,  I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers. I know they were racists, I know they were sexist,  but they were great. I mean, they were so brave and so bold  and so radical in what they did  that I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years,  and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable. It's because of what happened in 1776  with the Founding Fathers. The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view,  the original anatomical activists,  and this is why. What they rejected was an anatomical concept  and replaced it with another one  that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years. So as you all recall,  what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy,  and the monarchy was basically based  on a very simplistic concept of anatomy. The monarchs of the old world  didn't have a concept of DNA,  but they did have a concept of birthright. They had a concept of blue blood. They had the idea that the people who would be in political power  should be in political power  because of the blood being passed down  from grandfather to father to son and so forth. The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,  and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept,  and that concept  was all men are created equal. They leveled that playing field  and decided the anatomy that mattered  was the commonality of anatomy,  not the difference in anatomy,  and that was a really radical thing to do. Now they were doing it in part  because they were part of an Enlightenment system  where two things were growing up together. And that was democracy growing up,  but it was also science growing up at the same time. And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers,  a lot of them were very interested in science,  and they were interested in a concept  of a naturalistic world. They were moving away from supernatural explanations,  and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power,  where it transmitted  because of a very vague concept of birthright. They were moving towards a naturalistic concept. And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence,  they talk about nature and nature's God. They don't talk about God and God's nature. They're talking about the power of nature  to tell us who we are. So as part of that,  they were coming to us with a concept  that was about anatomical commonality. And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way  the Civil Rights movement of the future. They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great. So what happened years afterward? What happened was women, for example,  who wanted the right to vote,  took the Founding Fathers' concept  of anatomical commonality being more important  than anatomical difference  and said, "The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries  is not significant enough in terms of a difference  to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote,  the right to full citizenship,  the right to own property, etc., etc." And women successfully argued that. Next came the successful Civil Rights movement,  where we found people like Sojourner Truth  talking about, "Ain't I a woman?" We find men  on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement  saying, "I am a man." Again, people of color  appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy,  again, successfully. We see the same thing with the disability rights movement. The problem is, of course,  that, as we begin to look at all that commonality,  we have to begin to question  why we maintain certain divisions. Now mind you, I want to maintain some divisions,  anatomically, in our culture. For example, I don't want  to give a fish the same rights as a human. I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy. I don't want to say five-year-olds  should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry. So there are some anatomical divisions  that make sense to me and that I think we should retain. But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are  and why do we retain them and do they have meaning. So let's go back to those two beings  conceived at the beginning of this talk. We have two beings, both conceived  in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day. Let's imagine one of them, Mary,  is born three months prematurely,  so she's born on June 1, 1980. Henry, by contrast, is born at term,  so he's born on March 1, 1980. Simply by virtue of the fact  that Mary was born prematurely three months,  she comes into all sorts of rights  three months earlier than Henry does --  the right to consent to sex,  the right to vote, the right to drink. Henry has to wait for all of that,  not because he's actually any different in age, biologically,  except in terms of when he was born. We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are. Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male --  although I haven't told you that he's the XY one --  by virtue of being assumed to be male  is now liable to be drafted,  which Mary does not need to worry about. Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states  have the same right that Henry has in all the states,  namely, the right to marry. Henry can marry in every state a woman,  but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman. So we have these anatomical categories that persist  that are in many ways problematic and questionable. And the question to me becomes:  What do we do,  as our science gets to be so good  in looking at anatomy,  that we reach the point where we have to admit  that a democracy that's been based on anatomy  might start falling apart? I don't want to give up the science,  but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes  like the science is coming out from under us. So where do we go? It seems like what happens in our culture  is a sort of pragmatic attitude:  "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere,  so we will draw the line somewhere." But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position. So for example,  Texas has at one point decided  that what it means to marry a man  is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome,  and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome. Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes. But this is also very bizarre,  because of the story I told you at the beginning  about androgen insensitivity syndrome. If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy,  Dr. Martin Luther King,  he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech. He says we should judge people "based not on the color of their skin,  but on the content of their character,"  moving beyond anatomy. And I want to say, "Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea." But in practice, how do you do it? How do you judge people based on the content of character? I also want to point out  that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans,  because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know  that are probably more deserving of social services  than some humans I know. I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know  that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions  about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know. So how do we operationalize  the question of content of character? It turns out to be really difficult. And part of me also wonders,  what if content of character  turns out to be something that's scannable in the future --  able to be seen with an fMRI? Do we really want to go there? I'm not sure where we go. What I do know is that it seems to be really important  to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead  of thinking about this issue of democracy. We've done a really good job struggling with democracy,  and I think we would do a good job in the future. We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example,  where a man who's sexually attracted to other men  is liable to be murdered,  unless he's willing to submit to a sex change,  in which case he's allowed to live. We don't have that kind of situation. I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with --  a surgeon I talked to a few years ago  who had brought over a set of conjoined twins  in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself. But when I was on the phone with him,  asking why he was going to do this surgery --  this was a very high-risk surgery --  his answer was that, in this other nation,  these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this. My response to him was, "Well, have you considered political asylum  instead of a separation surgery?" The United States has offered tremendous possibility  for allowing people to be the way they are,  without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state. So I think we have to be in the lead. Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you  that I've been talking a lot about the fathers. And I want to think about the possibilities  of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like,  if we had more involved the mothers. And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist,  and that is that I think that there may be  different kinds of insights  that can come from different kinds of anatomies,  particularly when we have people thinking in groups. Now for years, because I've been interested in intersex,  I've also been interested in sex difference research. And one of the things that I've been really interested in  is looking at the differences between males and females  in terms of the way they think and operate in the world. And what we know from cross-cultural studies  is that females, on average --  not everyone, but on average --  are more inclined to be very attentive  to complex social relations  and to taking care of people  who are basically vulnerable within the group. And so if we think about that,  we have an interesting situation on our hands. Years ago, when I was in graduate school,  one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism --  I considered myself a feminist, as I still do --  asked a really strange question. He said, "Tell me what's feminine about feminism." And I thought, "Well that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender,  so there's nothing feminine about feminism." But the more I thought about his question,  the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism. That is to say, there might be something, on average,  different about female brains from male brains  that makes us more attentive  to deeply complex social relationships  and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable. So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive  to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state,  it's possible that if we injected more mothers  into this concept,  what we would have is more of a concept  of, not just how to protect,  but how to care for each other. And maybe that's where we need to go in the future,  when we take democracy beyond anatomy,  is to think less about the individual body,  in terms of the identity,  and think more about those relationships. So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union,  we're thinking about what we do for each other. Thank you. 
In 2007,  I decided that we needed to reconceptualize  how we thought about economic development. Our new goal should be  that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,  they should be able to choose between  at least a handful  of different cities  that were all competing to attract new residents. Now we're a long way away from that goal right now. There are billions of people in developing countries  who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them. But the amazing thing about cities  is they're worth so much more  than it costs to build them. So we could easily supply the world  with dozens, maybe hundreds,  of new cities. Now this might sound preposterous to you  if you've never thought about new cities. But just substitute apartment building for cities. Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;  the other half aren't there yet. You could try and expand the capacity  by doing additions on all the existing apartments. But you know what you'd run into  is those apartments and the surrounding areas  have rules to avoid discomfort  and the distractions of construction. So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions. But you could go out someplace brand new,  build a brand new apartment building,  as long as the rules there  were ones that facilitated construction  rather than getting in the way. So I proposed  that governments create new reform zones  big enough to hold cities  and gave them a name: charter cities. Later I learned that at about this same time,  Javier and Octavio  were thinking about the challenge of reform  in Honduras. They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year  would leave to go to the United States,  and they wanted to ask, what could they do  to make sure that those people could stay  and do the same things in Honduras. At one point, Javier said to Octavio,  "What if we took some of our empty land --  what if we just gave it to an embassy --  give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy --  and then if people want to go work  under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States,  they can go get jobs,  do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?" In the summer of 2009,  Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis. At the next regularly scheduled election,  Pepe Lobo won in a landslide  on a platform that promised reform,  but reconciliation as well. He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff. Meanwhile, I was getting ready  to give a talk at TEDGlobal. Through a process of refinement,  trial and error, a lot of user testing,  I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city  down to the bare essentials. The first point was the importance of rules,  like those rules that say  you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders. We pay a lot of attention to new technologies,  but it takes technologies and rules to get progress,  and it's usually the rules that hold us back. In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala  sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk. He showed it to Javier. They called me. They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country." So in December we met in Miami,  in a hotel conference room. I tried to explain this point  about how valuable cities are,  how much more valuable they are than they cost. And I used this slide  showing how valuable the raw land is  in a place like New York City:  notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,  per square meter. But it was a fairly abstract discussion,  and at some point when there was a pause,  Octavio said,  "Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk." So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,  a charter city is a place  where you start with uninhabited land,  a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there  and then a chance for people to opt in,  to go live under those rules or not. So I was asked by the president of Honduras  who said that we need to do this project,  this is important,  this could be the way forward for our country. I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa  and talk again on January fourth and fifth. So I presented  another fact-filled lecture that included a slide like this,  which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,  it has to be very big. This is a picture of Denver,  and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver. This airport alone  covers more than 100 square kilometers. So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans,  if you build a new city,  you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers. That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres. Everybody applauded politely. The faces in the audience  were very serious and attentive. The leader of the congress came up on stage and said,  "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,  but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk. I've got it here on my laptop." So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk. And it got to the essence,  which is that a new city could offer new choices for people. There would be a choice of a city which you could go to  which could be in Honduras,  instead of hundreds of miles away in the North. And it also involved new choices for leaders. Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras  would need help from partner countries,  who could benefit from partner countries  who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement,  so everybody can trust  that the charter really will be enforced. And the insight of President Lobo  was that that assurance of enforcement  that I was thinking about  as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city  could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras  who had suffered for so many years  from fear and distrust. We went and looked at a site. This picture's from there. It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers. And shortly thereafter, on January 19th,  they voted in the congress to amend their constitution  to have a constitutional provision  that allows for special development regions. In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,  the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment  was 124 to one. All parties, all factions in society, backed this. To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress. On February 17th they passed it again  with another vote of 114 to one. Immediately after that vote,  on February 21st to the 24th,  a delegation of about 30 Hondurans  went to the two places in the world  that are most interested in getting into the city building business. One is South Korea. This is a picture of a big, new city center  that's being built in South Korea --  bigger than downtown Boston. Everything you see there was built in four years,  after they spent four years getting the permits. The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore. They've actually built two cities already in China  and are preparing the third. So if you think about this practically,  here's where we are. They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city. They're putting in place a legal system  that could allow for managers to come in,  and also an external legal system. One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court  be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there. There's designers and builders of cities  They even can bring with them some financing. But the one thing you know they've already solved  is that there's lots of tenants. There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,  especially in a place with a free trade zone,  and there's lots of people who'd like to go there. Around the world, there's 700 million people  who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now. There's a million a year  who leave Latin America to go to the United States. Many of these are a father  who has to leave his family behind to go get a job --  sometimes a single mother  who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing. Sadly, sometimes there are even children  who are trying to get reunited with their parents  that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade. So what kind of an idea is it  to think about building a brand new city in Honduras? Or to build a dozen of these,  or a hundred of these, around the world? What kind of an idea is it  to think about insisting  that every family have a choice of several cities  that are competing to attract new residents? This is an idea worth spreading. And my friends from Honduras  asked me to say thank you, TED. 
I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase. But before I show you what I've got inside,  I'm going to make a very public confession,  and that is,  I'm outfit-obsessed. I love finding, wearing,  and more recently,  photographing and blogging  a different, colorful, crazy outfit  for every single occasion. But I don't buy anything new. I get all my clothes secondhand  from flea markets and thrift stores. Aww, thank you. Secondhand shopping  allows me to reduce the impact  my wardrobe has on the environment  and on my wallet. I get to meet all kinds of great people;  my dollars usually go to a good cause;  I look pretty unique;  and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt. I mean, what am I going to find today? Is it going to be my size? Will I like the color? Will it be under $20? If all the answers are yes,  I feel as though I've won. I want to get back to my suitcase  and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED. I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her? So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought. I brought seven pairs of underpants  and that's it. Exactly one week's worth of undies  is all I put in my suitcase. I was betting that I'd be able to find  everything else I could possible want to wear  once I got here to Palm Springs. And since you don't know me  as the woman walking around TED in her underwear --    that means I found a few things. And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now. Does that sound good? So as I do this,  I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons  that, believe it or not, I have picked up  in these adventures wearing nothing new. So let's start with Sunday. I call this "Shiny Tiger." You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great. You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50. This whole outfit, including the jacket,  cost me $55,  and it was the most expensive thing  that I wore the entire week. Monday: Color is powerful. It is almost physiologically impossible  to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants. If you are happy,  you are going to attract other happy people to you. Tuesday:  Fitting in is way overrated. I've spent a whole lot of my life  trying to be myself  and at the same time fit in. Just be who you are. If you are surrounding yourself with the right people,  they will not only get it,  they will appreciate it. Wednesday:  Embrace your inner child. Sometimes people tell me  that I look like I'm playing dress-up,  or that I remind them of their seven-year-old. I like to smile  and say, "Thank you." Thursday:  Confidence is key. If you think you look good in something,  you almost certainly do. And if you don't think you look good in something,  you're also probably right. I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out. But it wasn't until I turned 30  that I really got what this meant. And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second. If you believe you're a beautiful person  inside and out,  there is no look that you can't pull off. So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience. We should be able to rock anything we want to rock. Thank you. Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you:  Gold sequins go with everything. And finally, Saturday:  Developing your own unique personal style  is a really great way to tell the world something about you  without having to say a word. It's been proven to me time and time again  as people have walked up to me this week  simply because of what I'm wearing,  and we've had great conversations. So obviously this is not all going to fit  back in my tiny suitcase. So before I go home to Brooklyn,  I'm going to donate everything back. Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week  is that it's okay to let go. I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things  because around the corner,  there is always going to be  another crazy, colorful,  shiny outfit  just waiting for me,  if I put a little love in my heart and look. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
This is a representation of your brain,  and your brain can be broken into two parts. There's the left half, which is the logical side,  and then the right half,  which is the intuitive. And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,  then we can plot our brain. And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical. This would be someone who's entirely intuitive. So where would you put your brain on this scale? Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes,  but I think for most people in the audience,  your brain is something like this --  with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time. It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything. You can be logical and intuitive. And so I consider myself one of these people,  along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,  who need a good deal of logic  to string together these complex ideas. But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition  to actually make the experiments work. How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff. So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,  and then we develop our intuition from there. And really you do the same thing. So some intuition  that you may have developed over the years  is that one thing is only in one place at a time. I mean, it can sound weird to think about  one thing being in two different places at the same time,  but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it. And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop. He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over. But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,  and that's that large things don't let you get right past them,  and that they stay in one place. And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,  unless you're a particle physicist. It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,  because they don't play with car stops,  they play with these little weird particles. And when they play with their particles,  they find they do all sorts of really weird things --  like they can fly right through walls,  or they can be in two different places at the same time. And so they wrote down all these observations,  and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics. And so that's where physics was at a few years ago;  you needed quantum mechanics  to describe little, tiny particles. But you didn't need it  to describe the large, everyday objects around us. This didn't really sit well with my intuition,  and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often. Well, I play with them sometimes,  but not very often. And I've never seen them. I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle. But it didn't sit well with my logical side either. Because if everything is made up of little particles  and all the little particles  follow quantum mechanics,  then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics? I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing  if we could somehow show  that an everyday object  also follows quantum mechanics. So a few years ago, I set off to do just that. So I made one. This is the first object  that you can see  that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition. So what we're looking at here  is a tiny computer chip. And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle. And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute. This is a photograph of the object. And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center. And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal. So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,  and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge. And so I made this thing  in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip. I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,  and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours. For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine --  to make this swimming pool-shaped hole  underneath the device. This device has the ability  to be in a quantum superposition,  but it needs a little help to do it. Here, let me give you an analogy. You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator? I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,  but then other people get on board  and I stop doing those things  because I don't want to bother them,  or, frankly, scare them. So quantum mechanics says  that inanimate objects feel the same way. The fellow passengers for inanimate objects  are not just people,  but it's also the light shining on it  and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room. And so we knew, if we wanted to see  this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,  we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers. And so that's what we did. We turned off the lights,  and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,  and then we cooled it down  to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. Now, all alone in the elevator,  the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted. And so we measured its motion. We found it was moving in really weird ways. Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,  and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this --  like expanding and contracting bellows. And by giving it a gentle nudge,  we were able to make it both vibrate  and not vibrate  at the same time --  something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics. So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic. What does it mean for one thing  to be both vibrating and not vibrating  at the same time? So let's think about the atoms. So in one case:  all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal  are sitting still  and at the same time those same atoms  are moving up and down. Now it's only at precise times when they align. The rest of the time they're delocalized. That means that every atom  is in two different places at the same time,  which in turn means the entire chunk of metal  is in two different places. I think this is really cool. Really. It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years  because, check this out,  the difference in scale  between a single atom and that chunk of metal  between that chunk of metal and you. So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,  that chunk of metal can be in two different places,  then why not you? I mean, this is just my logical side talking. So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time,  what would that be like? How would your consciousness  handle your body being delocalized in space? There's one more part to the story. It's when we warmed it up,  and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box,  we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece. And so I had to develop this new intuition,  that it seems like all the objects in the elevator  are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space. You hear a lot of talk  about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected. Well, that's not quite right. It's more than that; it's deeper. It's that those connections,  your connections to all the things around you,  literally define who you are,  and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics. Thank you. 
My name is Amit. And 18 months ago, I had another job at Google,  and I pitched this idea  of doing something with museums and art  to my boss who's actually here,  and she allowed me to do it. And it took 18 months. A lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you,  with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries. But I'm going to focus on the demo. There are a lot of stories about why we did this. I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide,  and it's access. And I grew up in India. I had a great education -- I'm not complaining --  but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks. And so when I started traveling and going to these museums,  I started learning a lot. And while working at Google,  I tried to put this desire  to make it more accessible with technology together. So we formed a team, a great team of people,  and we started doing this. I'm going to probably get into the demo  and then tell you a couple of the interesting things  we've had since launch. So, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com. You look around at all these museums here. You've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA, the Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh. I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites,  the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Two ways of going in -- very simple. Click and, bang, you're in this museum. It doesn't matter where you are --  Bombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter. You move around, you have fun. You want to navigate around the museum? Open the plan up,  and, in one click, jump. You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor. Keep going. Have fun. Explore. Thanks. I haven't come to the best part. So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,  "The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met. I see this plus sign. If the museum has given us the image, you click on it. Now this is one of the images. So this is all of the meta-data information. For those of you who are truly interested in art,  you can click this -- but I'm going to click this off right now. And this is one of these images that we captured  in what we call gigapixel technology. So this image, for example,  has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels. And I get a lot of people asking me:  "What do you get for 10 billion pixels?" So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels. You can zoom around very simply. You see some fun stuff happening here. I love this guy; his expression is priceless. But then you really want to go deep. And so I started playing around,  and I found something going on over here. And I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting." Went in, and I started noticing  that these kids were actually beating something. I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met,  and actually found out that this is a game  called squall,  which involves beating a goose with a stick  on Shrove Tuesday. And apparently it was quite popular. I don't know why they did it,  but I learned something about it. Now just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks. Now just to give you some perspective,  I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get. Here is where we were,  and this is the painting. The best is yet to come -- so in a second. So now let's just quickly  jump into the MoMA, again in New York. So another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night." Now the example I showed you was all about finding details. But what if you want to see brush strokes? And what if you want to see  how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece? You zoom in. You really go in. I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting,  and I'm really going to get to the cracks. This is "The Starry Night,"  I think, never seen like this before. I'm going to show you my other favorite feature. There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time. This is the real cool part. It's called Collections. Any one of you, anybody --  doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor,  if you have a fancy house -- doesn't matter. You can go and create your own museum online --  create your own collection across all these images. Very simply, you go in --  and I've created this, called The Power of Zoom --  you can just zoom around. This is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery. You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends  and really get a conversation going  about what you're feeling  when you go through these masterpieces. So I think, in conclusion,  for me, the main thing  is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google. It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums. I probably shouldn't say that. It really comes from these artists. And that's been my humbling experience in this. I mean, I hope in this digital medium  that we do justice to their artwork  and represent it properly online. And the biggest question I get asked nowadays  is, "Did you do this  to replicate the experience of going to a museum?" And the answer is no. It's to supplement the experience. And that's it. Thank you. Thank you. 
Good afternoon, everybody. I've got something to show you. Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel. This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design. Let me tell you a bit about it. Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally,  and every boy in Italy grows up  with this picture on the wall of his bedroom --  but the reason I'm showing you this  is that something very interesting  happened in Formula 1 racing  over the past couple of decades. Now some time ago,  if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,  you take a budget, and you bet your budget  on a good driver and a good car. And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race. Now today, if you want to win the race,  actually you need also something like this --  something that monitors the car in real time,  has a few thousand sensors  collecting information from the car,  transmitting this information into the system,  and then processing it  and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions  and changing things in real time  as information is collected. This is what, in engineering terms,  you would call a real time control system. And basically, it's a system made of two components --  a sensing and an actuating component. What is interesting today  is that real time control systems  are starting to enter into our lives. Our cities, over the past few years,  just have been blanketed  with networks, electronics. They're becoming like computers in open air. And, as computers in open air,  they're starting to respond in a different way  to be able to be sensed and to be actuated. If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal. Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,  cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,  but they are 50 percent of the world's population. They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --  up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions. So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal. Beyond cities,  all of this sensing and actuating  is entering our everyday objects. That's from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing  at MoMA later this year, during the summer. It's called "Talk to Me." Well our objects, our environment  is starting to talk back to us. In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there  were becoming both a sensor and an actuator. And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans  with the environment out there. In a certain sense,  it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ... you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,  at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses --  actually you can still see a small chip underneath --  and said, shouted,  "Perché non parli? Why don't you talk?" Well today, for the first time,  our environment is starting to talk back to us. And I'll show just a few examples --  again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it. Let's starting with sensing. Well, the first project I wanted to share with you  is actually one of the first projects by our lab. It was four and a half years ago in Italy. And what we did there  was actually use a new type of network at the time  that had been deployed all across the world --  that's a cellphone network --  and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network,  that's collected anyway by the operator,  in order to understand  how the city works. The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006. It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup. Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,  and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt. And anyway, Italy won at the end. Now look at what happened that day  just by monitoring activity  happening on the network. Here you see the city. You see the Colosseum in the middle,  the river Tiber. It's morning, before the match. You see the timeline on the top. Early afternoon,  people here and there,  making calls and moving. The match begins -- silence. France scores. Italy scores. Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom. Second half. End of normal time. First overtime, second. Zidane, the headbutt in a moment. Italy wins. Yeah. Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center. You saw the big peak. The following day, again everybody went to the center  to meet the winning team  and the prime minister at the time. And then everybody moved down. You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo,  where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,  to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day. Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today  in a way that we couldn't have done  just a few years ago. Another quick example about sensing:  it's not about people,  but about things we use and consume. Well today, we know everything  about where our objects come from. This is a map that shows you  all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together. But we know very little about where things go. So in this project,  we actually developed some small tags  to track trash as it moves through the system. So we actually started with a number of volunteers  who helped us in Seattle,  just over a year ago,  to tag what they were throwing away --  different types of things, as you can see here --  things they would throw away anyway. Then we put a little chip, little tag,  onto the trash  and then started following it. Here are the results we just obtained. From Seattle ... after one week. With this information we realized  there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system. We can actually do the same thing with much less energy. This data was not available before. But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening. But the other thing is that we believe  that if we see every day  that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear,  it's still somewhere on the planet. And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there. And if we show that to people,  then we can also promote some behavioral change. So that was the reason for the project. My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman,  he could tell you much more about sensing  and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing,  but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning,  and that's actuating our environment. And the first project  is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain. It started with a question by the mayor of the city,  who came to us saying  that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition  of using water in public space, in architecture. And the question was: How could technology, new technology,  be added to that? And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop  was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,  solenoid valves, taps,  opening and closing. You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water. If those pixels fall,  you can write on it,  you can show patterns, images, text. And even you can approach it, and it will open up  to let you jump through,  as you see in this image. Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch. He liked it very much. And we got a commission to design a building  at the entrance of the expo. We called it Digital Water Pavilion. The whole building is made of water. There's no doors or windows,  but when you approach it,  it will open up to let you in. The roof also is covered with water. And if there's a bit of wind,  if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof. Or you could close the building,  and the whole architecture will disappear,  like in this case. You know, these days, you always get images during the winter,  when they take the roof down,  of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building." No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,  the architecture almost disappears. Here's the building working. You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside. And here was myself trying not to get wet,  testing the sensors that open the water. Well, I should tell you now what happened one night  when all of the sensors stopped working. But actually that night, it was even more fun. All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,  because the way of engaging with the building became something different. Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in,  but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,  and you had to jump without getting wet. And that was, for us, was very interesting,  because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,  we always think about how people will use the things we design. But then reality's always unpredictable. And that's the beauty of doing things  that are used and interact with people. Here is an image then of the building  with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,  and then projections on them. And this is what led us to think about  the following project I'll show you now. That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying. Imagine you could have small helicopters  that move in the air,  and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights --  almost as a cloud that can move in space. Here is the video. So imagine one helicopter,  like the one we saw before,  moving with others,  in synchrony. So you can have this cloud. You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this --  a regular configuration in two dimensions. Or in regular, but in three dimensions,  where the thing that changes is the light,  not the pixels' position. You can play with a different type. Imagine your screen could just appear  in different scales or sizes,  different types of resolution. But then the whole thing can be  just a 3D cloud of pixels  that you can approach and move through it  and see from many, many directions. Here is the real Flyfire  control and going down to form the regular grid as before. When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before. And imagine each of them then controlled by people. You can have each pixel  having an input that comes from people,  from people's movement, or so and so. I want to show you something here for the first time. We've been working with Roberto Bolle,  one of today's top ballet dancers --  the étoile at Metropolitan in New York  and La Scala in Milan --  and actually captured his movement in 3D  in order to use it as an input for Flyfire. And here you can see Roberto dancing. You see on the left the pixels,  the different resolutions being captured. It's both 3D scanning in real time  and motion capture. So you can reconstruct a whole movement. You can go all the way through. But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them  and play with color and movement  and gravity and rotation. So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs  for Flyfire. I wanted to show you the last project we are working on. It's something we're working on for the London Olympics. It's called The Cloud. And the idea here is, imagine, again,  we can involve people  in doing something and changing our environment --  almost to impart what we call cloud raising --  like barn raising, but with a cloud. Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel. And I think what is remarkable  that has happened over the past couple of years  is that, over the past couple of decades,  we went from the physical world to the digital one. This has been digitizing everything, knowledge,  and making that accessible through the Internet. Now today, for the first time --  and the Obama campaign showed us this --  we can go from the digital world,  from the self-organizing power of networks,  to the physical one. This can be, in our case,  we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol. That means something built in a city. But tomorrow it can be,  in order to tackle today's pressing challenges --  think about climate change or CO2 emissions --  how we can go from the digital world to the physical one. So the idea that we can actually involve people  in doing this thing together, collectively. The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,  in the same way as the real cloud  is a cloud made of particles. And those particles are water,  where our cloud is a cloud of pixels. It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels. You can move inside, have different types of experiences. You can actually see from underneath,  for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,  and really using it as a way to connect with the community. So both the physical cloud in the sky  and something you can go to the top [of],  like London's new mountaintop. You can enter inside it. And a kind of new digital beacon for the night --  but most importantly,  a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top. Thank you. 
How would you like to be better than you are? Suppose I said  that, with just a few changes in your genes,  you could get a better memory --  more precise,  more accurate and quicker. Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger,  with more stamina. Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident? How about living longer with good health? Or perhaps you're one of those  who's always yearned for more creativity. Which one would you like the most? Which would you like, if you could have just one? Creativity. How many people would choose creativity? Raise your hands. Let me see. A few. Probably about as many as there are creative people here. That's very good. How many would opt for memory? Quite a few more. How about fitness? A few less. What about longevity? Ah, the majority. That makes me feel very good as a doctor. If you could have any one of these,  it would be a very different world. Is it just imaginary? Or, is it, perhaps, possible? Evolution has been a perennial topic  here at the TED Conference,  but I want to give you today  one doctor's take on the subject. The great 20th-century geneticist,  T.G. Dobzhansky,  who was also a communicant  in the Russian Orthodox Church,  once wrote an essay that he titled  "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense  Except in the Light of Evolution." Now if you are one of those  who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution,  this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid,  take out your personal communications device --  I give you permission --  and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong,  because nothing in the rest of this talk  is going to make any sense whatsoever to you. But if you do accept  biological evolution,  consider this:  is it just about the past,  or is it about the future? Does it apply to others,  or does it apply to us? This is another look at the tree of life. In this picture,  I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions,  because if you look at the edges  of the tree of life,  every existing species  at the tips of those branches  has succeeded in evolutionary terms:  it has survived;  it has demonstrated a fitness  to its environment. The human part of this branch,  way out on one end,  is, of course, the one that we are most interested in. We branch off of a common ancestor  to modern chimpanzees  about six or eight million years ago. In the interval,  there have been perhaps 20 or 25  different species of hominids. Some have come and gone. We have been here for about 130,000 years. It may seem like we're quite remote  from other parts of this tree of life,  but actually, for the most part,  the basic machinery of our cells  is pretty much the same. Do you realize that we can take advantage  and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium  to produce the protein of human insulin  used to treat diabetics? This is not like human insulin;  this is the same protein  that is chemically indistinguishable  from what comes out of your pancreas. And speaking of bacteria,  do you realize that each of us carries in our gut  more bacteria  than there are cells in the rest of our body? Maybe 10 times more. I mean think of it,  when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image,  do you think about the bacteria? Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment  for those bacteria. It's warm, it's dark, it's moist,  it's very cozy. And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want  with no effort on their part. It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria,  with the occasional interruption  of the unintended forced rush to the exit. But otherwise,  you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria,  just as they are essential to your life. They help in the digestion of essential nutrients,  and they protect you against certain diseases. But what will come in the future? Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise  as a species? Or, are we destined  to become something different --  something, perhaps, even better adapted  to the environment? Now let's take a step back in time  to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago --  the Earth, the solar system,  about four and a half billion years --  the first signs of proto-life,  maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth --  the first multi-celled organisms,  perhaps as much  as 800 or a billion years ago --  and then the human species,  finally emerging  in the last 130,000 years. In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe,  life on Earth is like a brief measure;  the animal kingdom,  like a single measure;  and human life,  a small grace note. That was us. That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk,  so I hope you enjoyed it. Now when I was a freshman in college,  I took my first biology class. I was fascinated  by the elegance and beauty of biology. I became enamored of the power of evolution,  and I realized something very fundamental:  in most of the existence of life  in single-celled organisms,  each cell simply divides,  and all of the genetic energy of that cell  is carried on in both daughter cells. But at the time multi-celled organisms come online,  things start to change. Sexual reproduction enters the picture. And very importantly,  with the introduction of sexual reproduction  that passes on the genome,  the rest of the body  becomes expendable. In fact, you could say  that the inevitability of the death of our bodies  enters in evolutionary time  at the same moment  as sexual reproduction. Now I have to confess,  when I was a college undergraduate,  I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex --  it seemed pretty reasonable at the time,  but with each passing year,  I've come to have increasing doubts. I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns,  who was performing still in Las Vegas  well into his 90s. And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door. He answers the door. Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl. She looks at him and says,  "I'm here for super sex." "That's fine," says George, "I'll take the soup." I came to realize,  as a physician,  that I was working toward a goal  which was different from the goal of evolution --  not necessarily contradictory, just different. I was trying to preserve the body. I wanted to keep us healthy. I wanted to restore health from disease. I wanted us to live long and healthy lives. Evolution is all about passing on the genome  to the next generation,  adapting and surviving  through generation after generation. From an evolutionary point of view,  you and I are like the booster rockets  designed to send the genetic payload  into the next level of orbit  and then drop off into the sea. I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed  when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve it through not dying." Evolution does not necessarily  favor the longest-lived. It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest  or the strongest or the fastest,  and not even the smartest. Evolution favors  those creatures best adapted  to their environment. That is the sole test  of survival and success. At the bottom of the ocean,  bacteria that are thermophilic  and can survive at the steam vent heat  that would otherwise produce, if fish were there,  sous-vide cooked fish,  nevertheless, have managed  to make that a hospitable environment for them. So what does this mean,  as we look back at what has happened in evolution,  and as we think about the place again  of humans in evolution,  and particularly as we look ahead  to the next phase,  I would say  that there are a number of possibilities. The first is that we will not evolve. We have reached  a kind of equipoise. And the reasoning behind that would be,  first, we have, through medicine,  managed to preserve a lot of genes  that would otherwise be selected out  and be removed from the population. And secondly, we as a species  have so configured our environment  that we have managed to make it adapt to us  as well as we adapt to it. And by the way, we immigrate and circulate  and intermix so much  that you can't any longer  have the isolation that is necessary  for evolution to take place. A second possibility  is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind,  natural, imposed by the forces of nature. And the argument here would be  that the wheels of evolution grind slowly,  but they are inexorable. And as far as isolation goes,  when we as a species  do colonize distant planets,  there will be the isolation and the environmental changes  that could produce evolution  in the natural way. But there's a third possibility,  an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility. I call it neo-evolution --  the new evolution  that is not simply natural,  but guided and chosen  by us as individuals  in the choices that we will make. Now how could this come about? How could it be possible that we would do this? Consider, first, the reality  that people today, in some cultures,  are making choices about their offspring. They're, in some cultures,  choosing to have more males than females. It's not necessarily good for the society,  but it's what the individual and the family are choosing. Think also,  if it were possible ever  for you to choose, not simply to choose the sex of your child,  but for you in your body  to make the genetic adjustments  that would cure or prevent diseases. What if you could make the genetic changes  to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's  or reduce the risk of cancer  or eliminate stroke? Wouldn't you want  to make those changes  in your genes? If we look ahead,  these kind of changes  are going to be increasingly possible. The Human Genome Project  started in 1990,  and it took 13 years. It cost 2.7 billion dollars. The year after it was finished in 2004,  you could do the same job  for 20 million dollars in three to four months. Today, you can have a complete sequence  of the three billion base pairs in the human genome  at a cost of about 20,000 dollars  and in the space of about a week. It won't be very long  before the reality will be  the 1,000-dollar human genome,  and it will be increasingly available for everyone. Just a week ago,  the National Academy of Engineering  awarded its Draper Prize  to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer,  two scientists who independently developed techniques  to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster  and to lead to desirable proteins  in a more efficient way --  what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution." A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize  was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka  for his research  in which he took an adult skin cell,  a fibroblast,  and by manipulating just four genes,  he induced that cell  to revert to a pluripotential stem cell --  a cell potentially capable  of becoming any cell in your body. These changes are coming. The same technology  that has produced the human insulin in bacteria  can make viruses  that will not only protect you against themselves,  but induce immunity against other viruses. Believe it or not,  there's an experimental trial going on  with vaccine against influenza  that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant. Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco? These are all reality today,  and [in] the future, will be evermore possible. Imagine then  just two other little changes. You can change the cells in your body,  but what if you could change the cells in your offspring? What if you could change the sperm and the ova,  or change the newly fertilized egg,  and give your offspring a better chance  at a healthier life --  eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia,  reduce the risk of cancer? Who doesn't want healthier children? And then, that same analytic technology,  that same engine of science  that can produce  the changes to prevent disease,  will also enable us  to adopt super-attributes,  hyper-capacities --  that better memory. Why not have the quick wit  of a Ken Jennings,  especially if you can augment it  with the next generation of the Watson machine? Why not have the quick twitch muscle  that will enable you to run faster and longer? Why not live longer? These will be irresistible. And when we are at a position  where we can pass it on to the next generation,  and we can adopt the attributes we want,  we will have converted  old-style evolution  into neo-evolution. We'll take a process  that normally might require 100,000 years,  and we can compress it down to a thousand years --  and maybe even in the next 100 years. These are choices  that your grandchildren,  or their grandchildren,  are going to have before them. Will we use these choices  to make a society that is better,  that is more successful, that is kinder? Or, will we selectively choose different attributes  that we want for some of us  and not for others of us? Will we make a society  that is more boring and more uniform,  or more robust and more versatile? These are the kinds of questions  that we will have to face. And most profoundly of all,  will we ever be able to develop the wisdom,  and to inherit the wisdom,  that we'll need to make these choices wisely? For better or worse,  and sooner than you may think,  these choices will be up to us. Thank you. 
Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft. Imagine a plane full of smoke. Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack. It sounds scary. Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in 1D. I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants. So I looked at them right away,  and they said, "No problem. We probably hit some birds." The pilot had already turned the plane around,  and we weren't that far. You could see Manhattan. Two minutes later,  three things happened at the same time. The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River. That's usually not the route. He turns off the engines. Now, imagine being in a plane with no sound. And then he says three words. The most unemotional three words I've ever heard. He says, "Brace for impact." I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore. I could see in her eyes, it was terror. Life was over. Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day. I learned that it all changes in an instant. We have this bucket list,  we have these things we want to do in life,  and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't,  all the fences I wanted to mend,  all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did. As I thought about that later on,  I came up with a saying,  which is, "I collect bad wines." Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it. I no longer want to postpone anything in life. And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life. The second thing I learned that day --  and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge,  which was by not a lot --    I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret. I've lived a good life. In my own humanity and mistakes,  I've tried to get better at everything I tried. But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in. And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter  with people that matter. And I thought about my relationship with my wife,  with my friends, with people. And after, as I reflected on that,  I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better. I've not had a fight with my wife in two years. It feels great. I no longer try to be right;  I choose to be happy. The third thing I learned --  and this is as your mental clock starts going, "15, 14, 13." You can see the water coming. I'm saying, "Please blow up." I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces  like you've seen in those documentaries. And as we're coming down,  I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary. It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives. But it was very sad. I didn't want to go; I love my life. And that sadness really framed in one thought,  which is, I only wish for one thing. I only wish I could see my kids grow up. About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter --  first-grader, not much artistic talent --    Yet! And I'm bawling, I'm crying, like a little kid. And it made all the sense in the world to me. I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots,  that the only thing that matters in my life  is being a great dad. Above all, above all,  the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad. I was given the gift of a miracle,  of not dying that day. I was given another gift,  which was to be able to see into the future  and come back  and live differently. I challenge you guys that are flying today,  imagine the same thing happens on your plane --  and please don't --  but imagine, and how would you change? What would you get done  that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever? How would you change your relationships  and the negative energy in them? And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can? Thank you. 
I have had the distinct blessing in my life  to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects. But the coolest I ever worked on  was around this guy. This guy's name is TEMPT. TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s. And he came up home from a run one day  and said, "Dad, my legs are tingling." And that was the onset of ALS. So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed. He only has use of his eyes. I was exposed to him. I have a company that does design and animation,  so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part  of what we admire and respect in the art world. And so we decided that we were going to sponsor  Tony, TEMPT, and his cause. So I went and met with his brother and father  and said, "We're going to give you this money. What are you going to do with it?" And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again. I just want to be able to communicate with him  and him to be able to communicate with me." And I said, "Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking --  don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate  via these devices?" And he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and  you've got really amazing insurance,  you can't actually do that. These devices aren't accessible to people." And I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?" Has everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?" That's how they communicate --  so run their finger along. I said, "That's archaic. How can that be?" So I showed up with the desire to just write a check,  and instead, I wrote a check  that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash. I committed to his brother and his father right then and there --  I'm like, "All right, here's the deal:  Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine,  and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again. Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him  isn't able to communicate it." So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that. I met these guys called GRL,  Graffiti Research Lab,  and they have a technology  that allows them to project a light onto any surface  and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it,  and it just registers the negative space. So they go around and do art installations like this. All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle. First it starts with the sexual organs,  then it starts with cuss words,  then it was Bush slanders  and then people actually got to art. But there was always a life cycle to their presentations. So I went home and was having dinner with my wife  and was telling her about this,  and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists  where you can use your eyes to control things,  why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser  and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome." So that started the journey. And about two years later, about a year later,  after a bunch of organization  and a bunch of moving things around,  we'd accomplished a couple things. One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies,  and we actually got TEMPT a machine  that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine. Which was awesome. And he's seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda,  because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him,  and you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing." The other thing we did  is we flew seven programmers from all over the world --  literally every corner of the world --  into our house. My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage,  and these hackers and programmers  and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house. A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that  and that we were going to come back  and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls. But for over two weeks,  we programmed,  we went to the Venice boardwalk,  my kids got involved,  my dog got involved,  and we created this. This is called the EyeWriter,  and you can see the description. This is a cheap pair of sunglasses  that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk,  some copper wire  and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack. We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open,  mounted it to an LED light,  and now there's a device that is free --  you build this yourself, we publish the code for free,  you download the software for free. And now we've created a device  that has absolutely no limitations. There's no insurance company that can say "No." There's no hospital that can say "No." Anybody who's paralyzed now has access  to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes. Thank you. Thank you guys very much. That was awesome. So at the end of the two weeks,  we went back to TEMPT's room. I love this picture, because this is someone else's room  and that's his room. So there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling. And after over a year of planning,  two weeks of programming,  carb-fest and all-night sessions,  Tony drew again for the first time in seven years. And this is an amazing picture,  because this is his life support system,  and he's looking over his life support system. We kicked his bed so that he could see out. And we set up a projector  on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital. And he drew again for the first time,  in front of his family and friends --  and you can only imagine  what the feeling in the parking lot was. The funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too,  so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too. So at the end of this, he sent us an email,  and this is what the email said:  "That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years. I feel like I had been held underwater,  and someone finally reached down  and pulled my head up so I could breathe." Isn't that awesome? So that's kind of our battle cry. That's what keeps us going and keeps us developing. And we've got such a long way to go with this. This is an amazing device,  but it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch. And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more. So we're in the process of trying to figure out  how to make it better, faster, stronger. Since that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment. We've won a bunch of awards. Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing. It's all coming out of our own pockets. So the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic." Armstrong Twittered about us,  and then in December, Time magazine honored us  as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool. The coolest thing about this --  and this is what's completing the whole circle --  is that in April of this year,  at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles,  there's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets." And "Art of the Streets" is going to have  pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene --  Banksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS --  all of these guys will be there. TEMPT's going to be in the show,  which is pretty awesome. So basically this is my point:  If you see something that's not possible,  make it possible. Everything in this room wasn't possible --  this stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter --  wasn't possible at one point. Make it possible, everyone in this room. I'm not a programmer,  never done anything with ocular recognition technology,  but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people  so that we could make something happen. And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself  every single day  when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done:  if not now, then when? And if not me, then who? Thank you guys. 
I have spent the past few years  putting myself into situations  that are usually very difficult  and at the same time somewhat dangerous. I went to prison --  difficult. I worked in a coal mine --  dangerous. I filmed in war zones --  difficult and dangerous. And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this --  fun in the beginning,  little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end. In fact, most of my career,  I've been immersing myself  into seemingly horrible situations  for the whole goal of trying  in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting,  that hopefully break them down in a way  that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience. So when I knew I was coming here  to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship,  I knew I would want to do something a little different. So as some of you may or may not have heard,  a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay. I sent out some Facebook messages,  some Twitter messages,  and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights  to my 2011 TED Talk. That's right, some lucky individual, corporation,  for-profit or non-profit,  was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity --  because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again --    to buy the naming rights  to the talk you're watching right now,  that at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content  and didn't really give much hint  as to what the subject matter would actually be. So what you were getting was this:  Your name here presents:  My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is  and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face,  especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it. But that being said,  it's a very good media opportunity. You know how many people watch these TED Talks? It's a lot. That's just a working title, by the way. So even with that caveat,  I knew that someone would buy the naming rights. Now if you'd have asked me that a year ago,  I wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty. But in the new project that I'm working on, my new film,  we examine the world of marketing, advertising. And as I said earlier,  I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years,  but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me,  for anything as difficult  or as dangerous  as going into the rooms with these guys. You see, I had this idea for a movie. Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film  all about product placement, marketing and advertising,  where the entire film is funded  by product placement, marketing and advertising. So the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold." So what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"  is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish,  is branded from beginning to end --  from the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie,  which is brand X. Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium,  the Staples Center ... these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever. And so the film explores this whole idea --   It's what?  In perpetuity, forever? I'm a redundant person.   That was more for emphasis. It was, "In perpetuity. Forever." But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor,  but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film. So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ... the greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"  the greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold." Xavier Kochhar: So the idea is,  beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life,  but actually get them to finance the film?   MS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work. The goal of this whole film is transparency. You're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie. So that's the whole concept,  the whole film, start to finish. And I would love for CEG to help make it happen. Robert Friedman: You know it's funny,  because when I first hear it,  it is the ultimate respect  for an audience. Guy: I don't know how receptive  people are going to be to it, though. XK: Do you have a perspective --  I don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation --  but do you know how this is going to play out?   David Cohn: How much money does it take to do this? MS: 1.5 million.   John Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them,  but I think it's certainly worth pursuing  a couple big, really obvious brands. XK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out,  we look like a bunch of blithering idiots. MS: What do you think the response is going to be? Stuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be "no." MS: But is it a tough sell because of the film  or a tough sell because of me? JK: Both. MS: ... Meaning not so optimistic. So, sir, can you help me? I need help. MK: I can help you. MS: Okay.   Awesome. MK: We've gotta figure out which brands. MS: Yeah.   When you look at the people you deal with .. MK: We've got some places we can go.   Turn the camera off. MS: I thought "Turn the camera off"  meant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation." Turns out it really means,  "We want nothing to do with your movie." MS: And just like that, one by one,  all of these companies suddenly disappeared. None of them wanted anything to do with this movie. I was amazed. They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project. And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising,  was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible,  to get as many people to see it as possible. Especially in today's world,  this intersection of new media and old media  and the fractured media landscape,  isn't the idea to get  that new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle  that's going to get that message to the masses? No, that's what I thought. But the problem was, you see,  my idea had one fatal flaw,  and that flaw was this. Actually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever. That wouldn't have been a problem at all. This would have been fine. But what this image represents was the problem. See, when you do a Google image search for transparency,  this is ---      This is one of the first images that comes up. So I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin. No. This is was the problem: transparency --  free from pretense or deceit;  easily detected or seen through;  readily understood;  characterized by visibility or accessibility of information,  especially concerning business practices --  that last line being probably the biggest problem. You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days. Our politicians say it, our president says it,  even our CEO's say it. But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality,  something suddenly changes. But why? Well, transparency is scary --    like that odd, still-screaming bear. It's unpredictable --      like this odd country road. And it's also very risky. What else is risky? Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip. That's very risky. Now when I started talking to companies  and telling them that we wanted to tell this story,  and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story. We want you to tell a story,  but we just want to tell our story." See, when I was a kid  and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie --  and there he is giving me the look he often gave me --  he would say, "Son, there's three sides to every story. There's your story,  there's my story  and there's the real story." Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story. But with only one company, one agency willing to help me --  and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years --  I realized that I would have to go on my own,  I'd have to cut out the middleman  and go to the companies myself with all of my team. So what you suddenly started to realize --  or what I started to realize --  is that when you started having conversations with these companies,  the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem. MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films,  and I have friends who make little independent films like I make. And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies  say the reason their films are so successful  is because of the brand partners that they have. And then my friends who make small independent films  say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete  with these big, giant Hollywood movies?" And the movie is called  "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold." So how specifically will we see Ban in the film? Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet,  you will see Ban deodorant. While anytime I do an interview with someone,  I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview? Are you ready? You look a little nervous. I want to help you calm down. So maybe you should put some one before the interview." So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents. Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds,"  they'll have their chance. We will have them geared for both male or female --  solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be. That's the two-cent tour. So now I can answer any of your questions  and give you the five-cent tour. Karen Frank: We are a smaller brand. Much like you talked about being a smaller movie,  we're very much a challenger brand. So we don't have the budgets that other brands have. So doing things like this -- you know,  remind people about Ban --  is kind of why were interested in it. MS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban? Ban is blank. KF: That's a great question. Woman: Superior technology. MS: Technology's not the way you want to describe something  somebody's putting in their armpit. Man: We talk about bold, fresh. I think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive,  versus "fights odor and wetness." It keeps you fresh. How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness,  more freshness, three times fresher. Things like that that are more of that positive benefit. MS: And that's a multi-million dollar corporation. What about me? What about a regular guy? I need to go talk to the man on the street,  the people who are like me, the regular Joes. They need to tell me about my brand. MS: How would you guys describe your brand? Man: Um, my brand? I don't know. I like really nice clothes. Woman: 80's revival  unless it's laundry day. MS: All right, what is brand Gerry? Gerry: Unique.   Man: I guess what kind of genre, style I am  would be like dark glamor. I like a lot of black colors,  a lot of grays and stuff like that. But usually I have an accessory,  like sunglasses,  or I like crystal and things like that too. Woman: If Dan were a brand,  he might be a classic convertible  Mercedes Benz. Man 2: The brand that I am  is, I would call it casual fly. Woman 2: Part hippie, part yogi,  part Brooklyn girl -- I don't know. Man 3: I'm the pet guy. I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world. So I guess that's my brand. In my warped little industry, that's my brand. Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods. Man 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand. Is that something? Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand. Tom: I'm Tom. MS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself  at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly. And what I realized is I needed an expert. I needed somebody who could get inside my head,  somebody who could really help me understand  what they call your "brand personality." And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg. They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark  discover that brand personality. If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me. Abigail: You brought your pictures, right? MS: I did. The very first picture  is a picture of my family. A: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are. MS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world. A: Tell me about this world. MS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in --  like people who are around you, your friends, your family,  the way you live your life, the job you do. All those things stemmed and started from one place,  and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia. A: What's the next one you want to talk about? MS: The next one: This was the best day ever. A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are? MS: It's like, who do I want to be? I like things that are different. I like things that are weird. I like weird things. A: Tell me about the "why" phase -- what does that do for us? What is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now? Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent? Tell me a little bit about that part. ... A little more about you that is not who you are. What are some other metamorphoses that you've had? ... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on? MS: EEEEEE!  No, thank you. A: Thanks for you patience.   A: Yeah.  All right. MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this. There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there. Lindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this idea  that you had two distinct, but complementary  sides to your brand personality --  the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand. Those are juxtaposed very nicely together. And I think there's almost a paradox with those. And I think some companies  will just focus on one of their strengths or the other  instead of focusing on both. Most companies tend to -- and it's human nature --  to avoid things that they're not sure of,  avoid fear, those elements,  and you really embrace those,  and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see. What other brands are like that? The first on here is the classic, Apple. And you can see here too, Target, Wii,  Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue. Now there's playful brands and mindful brands,  those things that have come and gone,  but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing. MS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand? If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality,  what would you be? Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing? Or are you more of a down attribute? Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative? Up attributes are things like being playful,  being fresh like the Fresh Prince,  contemporary, adventurous,  edgy or daring like Errol Flynn,  nimble or agile, profane, domineering,  magical or mystical like Gandalf. Or are you more of a down attribute? Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007? Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective,  empathetic like the Oprah? Are you reliable, stable, familiar,  safe, secure, sacred,  contemplative or wise  like the Dalai Lama or Yoda? Over the course of this film,  we had 500-plus companies  who were up and down companies  saying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project. They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control,  they would have no control over the final product. But we did get 17 brand partners  who were willing to relinquish that control,  who wanted to be in business  with someone as mindful and as playful as myself  and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories  that normally we wouldn't be able to tell --  stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind. They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing,  as we got into telling the story in this film  about how now they're using MRI's  to target the desire centers of your brain  for both commercials as well as movie marketing. We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising. In the entire city for the past five years,  there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing. And we went to school districts  where now companies are making their way  into cash-strapped schools all across America. What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of,  or I've had the most success in,  are ones where I've interacted with things directly. And that's what these brands did. They cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies  and said, "Maybe these agencies  don't have my best interest in mind. I'm going to deal directly with the artist. I'm going to work with him to create something different,  something that's going to get people thinking,  that's going to challenge the way we look at the world." And how has that been for them? Has it been successful? Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look. According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January,  and since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing --  we've had 900 million media impressions for this film. That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period. That's only online -- no print, no TV. The film hasn't even been distributed yet. It's not even online. It's not even streaming. It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet. So ultimately,  this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum. And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to  advised their clients not to take part. What I always believe  is that if you take chances, if you take risks,  that in those risks will come opportunity. I believe that when you push people away from that,  you're pushing them more towards failure. I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse,  then you're preparing your whole company  to be reward challenged. I feel like that what has to happen moving forward  is we need to encourage people to take risks. We need to encourage people to not be afraid  of opportunities that may scare them. Ultimately, moving forward,  I think we have to embrace fear. We've got to put that bear in a cage. Embrace fear. Embrace risk. One big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk. And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency. Today, more than ever,  a little honesty is going to go a long way. And that being said, through honesty and transparency,  my entire talk, "Embrace Transparency,"  has been brought to you  by my good friends at EMC,  who for $7,100  bought the naming rights on eBay. EMC: Turning big data  into big opportunity  for organizations all over the world. EMC presents: "Embrace Transparency." Thank you very much, guys. June Cohen: So, Morgan,  in the name of transparency,  what exactly happened to that $7,100? MS: That is a fantastic question. I have in my pocket a check  made out to the parent organization to the TED organization,  the Sapling Foundation --  a check for $7,100  to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED. 
The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm  is actually quite simple. We don't want Iran to get the bomb. Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons  is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The gray boxes that you see,  these are real-time control systems. Now if we manage to compromise these systems  that control drive speeds and valves,  we can actually cause a lot of problems  with the centrifuge. The gray boxes don't run Windows software;  they are a completely different technology. But if we manage  to place a good Windows virus  on a notebook  that is used by a maintenance engineer  to configure this gray box,  then we are in business. And this is the plot behind Stuxnet. So we start with a Windows dropper. The payload goes onto the gray box,  damages the centrifuge,  and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --  mission accomplished. That's easy, huh? I want to tell you how we found that out. When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,  it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was. The only thing that was known  is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,  used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities. And it seemed to want to do something  with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems. So that got our attention,  and we started a lab project  where we infected our environment with Stuxnet  and checked this thing out. And then some very funny things happened. Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat  that didn't like our cheese --  sniffed, but didn't want to eat. Didn't make sense to me. And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,  I realized, well, this is a directed attack. It's completely directed. The dropper is prowling actively  on the gray box if a specific configuration is found,  and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect  is actually running on that target. And if not, Stuxnet does nothing. So that really got my attention,  and we started to work on this  nearly around the clock,  because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is. It could be, let's say for example,  a U.S. power plant,  or a chemical plant in Germany. So we better find out what the target is soon." So we extracted and decompiled  the attack code,  and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --  a smaller one and a bigger one. And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered  by people who obviously had all insider information. They knew all the bits and bites  that they had to attack. They probably even know the shoe size of the operator. So they know everything. And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet  is complex and high-tech,  let me tell you this:  the payload is rocket science. It's way above everything  that we have ever seen before. Here you see a sample of this actual attack code. We are talking about --  around about 15,000 lines of code. Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language. And I want to tell you how we were able  to make sense out of this code. So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,  because we know what they do. And then we were looking for timers and data structures  and trying to relate them to the real world --  to potential real world targets. So we do need target theories  that we can prove or disprove. In order to get target theories,  we remember  that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,  it must be a high-value target  and it is most likely located in Iran,  because that's where most of the infections had been reported. Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area. It basically boils down  to the Bushehr nuclear power plant  and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant. So I told my assistant,  "Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base." And I phoned them up and picked their brain  in an effort to match their expertise  with what we found in code and data. And that worked pretty well. So we were able to associate  the small digital warhead  with the rotor control. The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,  that black object that you see. And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,  you are actually able to crack the rotor  and eventually even have the centrifuge explode. What we also saw  is that the goal of the attack  was really to do it slowly and creepy --  obviously in an effort  to drive maintenance engineers crazy,  that they would not be able to figure this out quickly. The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this  at data and data structures. So for example, the number 164  really stands out in that code;  you can't overlook it. I started to research scientific literature  on how these centrifuges  are actually built in Natanz  and found they are structured  in what is called a cascade,  and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges. So that made sense, that was a match. And it even got better. These centrifuges in Iran  are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages. And guess what we found in the attack code? An almost identical structure. So again, that was a real good match. And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at. Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this. These results have been obtained  over several weeks of really hard labor. And we often went into just a dead end  and had to recover. Anyway, so we figured out  that both digital warheads  were actually aiming at one and the same target,  but from different angles. The small warhead is taking one cascade,  and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,  and the big warhead  is talking to six cascades  and manipulating valves. So in all, we are very confident  that we have actually determined what the target is. It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz. So we don't have to worry  that other targets  might be hit by Stuxnet. Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --  really knocked my socks off. Down there is the gray box,  and on the top you see the centrifuges. Now what this thing does  is it intercepts the input values from sensors --  so for example, from pressure sensors  and vibration sensors --  and it provides legitimate program code,  which is still running during the attack,  with fake input data. And as a matter of fact, this fake input data  is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet. So it's just like from the Hollywood movies  where during the heist,  the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video. That's cool, huh? The idea here is obviously  not only to fool the operators in the control room. It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive. The idea  is to circumvent a digital safety system. We need digital safety systems  where a human operator could not act quick enough. So for example, in a power plant,  when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,  you must open relief valves within a millisecond. Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator. So this is where we need digital safety systems. And when they are compromised,  then real bad things can happen. Your plant can blow up. And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it. That's scary. But it gets worse. And this is very important, what I'm going to say. Think about this:  this attack is generic. It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,  with centrifuges,  with uranium enrichment. So it would work as well, for example,  in a power plant  or in an automobile factory. It is generic. And you don't have -- as an attacker --  you don't have to deliver this payload  by a USB stick,  as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet. You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading. Just spread it as wide as possible. And if you do that,  what you end up with  is a cyber weapon of mass destruction. That's the consequence  that we have to face. So unfortunately,  the biggest number of targets for such attacks  are not in the Middle East. They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan. So all of the green areas,  these are your target-rich environments. We have to face the consequences,  and we better start to prepare right now. Thanks. Chris Anderson: I've got a question. Ralph, it's been quite widely reported  that people assume that Mossad  is the main entity behind this. Is that your opinion? Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that? Yeah. Okay. My opinion is that the Mossad is involved,  but that the leading force is not Israel. So the leading force behind that  is the cyber superpower. There is only one,  and that's the United States --  fortunately, fortunately. Because otherwise,  our problems would even be bigger. CA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph. 
I want you now to imagine  a wearable robot  that gives you superhuman abilities,  or another one that takes wheelchair users  up standing and walking again. We at Berkeley Bionics  call these robots exoskeletons. These are nothing else  than something that you put on in the morning,  and it will give you extra strength,  and it will further enhance your speed,  and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance. It is actually the true integration  of the man and the machine. But not only that --  it will integrate and network you  to the universe  and other devices out there. This is just not some blue sky thinking. To show you now what we are working on  by starting out talking about  the American soldier,  that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs,  and they are being asked to carry more equipment. Obviously, this is resulting  in some major complications --  back injuries, 30 percent of them --  chronic back injuries. So we thought we would look at this challenge  and create an exoskeleton  that would help deal with this issue. So let me now introduce to you HULC --  or the Human Universal  Load Carrier. Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton,  I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain  for many hours. Its flexible design allows for deep squats,  crawls and high-agility movements. It senses what I want to do, where I want to go,  and then augments my strength and endurance. Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner  to introduce this device,  this new exoskeleton this year. So this is for real. Now let's turn our heads  towards the wheelchair users,  something that I'm particularly passionate about. There are 68 million people  estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide. This is about one percent of the total population. And that's actually a conservative estimate. We are talking here about, oftentimes,  very young individuals with spinal cord injuries,  that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s --  hit a wall  and the wheelchair's the only option. But it is also the aging population  that is multiplying in numbers. And the only option, pretty much --  when it's stroke or other complications --  is the wheelchair. And that is actually for the last 500 years,  since its very successful introduction, I must say. So we thought we would start  writing a brand new chapter  of mobility. Let me now introduce you to eLEGS  that is worn by Amanda Boxtel  that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured,  and as a result of that  she has not been able to walk  for 19 years until now. Amanda Boxtel: Thank you. EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set. It has sensors. It's completely non-invasive,  sensors in the crutches  that send signals back to our onboard computer  that is sitting here at her back. There are battery packs here as well  that power motors that are sitting at her hips,  as well as her knee joints,  that move her forward  in this kind of smooth and very natural gait. AB: I was 24 years old  and at the top of my game  when a freak summersault while downhill skiing  paralyzed me. In a split second,  I lost all sensation and movement  below my pelvis. Not long afterwards,  a doctor strode into my hospital room,  and he said, "Amanda,  you'll never walk again." And that was 19 yeas ago. He robbed  every ounce of hope  Adaptive technology  has since enabled me  to learn how to downhill ski again,  to rock climb and even handcycle. But nothing has been invented  that enables me to walk,  until now. Thank you. EB: As you can see,  we have the technology,  we have the platforms  to sit down and have discussions with you. It's in our hands,  and we have all the potential here  to change the lives  of future generations --  not only for the soldiers,  or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users,  but for everyone. AB: Thanks. 
I just came back from a community  that holds the secret to human survival. It's a place where women run the show,  have sex to say hello,  and play rules the day --  where fun is serious business. And no, this isn't Burning Man  or San Francisco. Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins. This is the world of wild bonobos  in the jungles of Congo. Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees,  your living closest relative. That means we all share a common ancestor,  an evolutionary grandmother,  who lived around six million years ago. Now, chimpanzees are well-known  for their aggression. But unfortunately,  we have made too much of an emphasis  of this aspect  in our narratives of human evolution. But bonobos show us  the other side of the coin. While chimpanzees  are dominated by big, scary guys,  bonobo society  is run by empowered females. These guys have really worked something out,  since this leads to a highly tolerant society  where fatal violence  has not been observed yet. But unfortunately,  bonobos are the least understood  of the great apes. They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle,  and it has been very difficult to study them. The Congo is a paradox --  a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty,  but also the heart of darkness itself --  the scene of a violent conflict  that has raged for decades  and claimed nearly as many lives  as the First World War. Not surprisingly,  this destruction also endangers bonobo survival. Bushmeat trades and forest loss  means we couldn't fill a small stadium  with all the bonobos that are left in the world --  and we're not even sure of that to be honest. Yet, in this land of violence and chaos,  you can hear hidden laughter  swaying the trees. Who are these cousins? We know them as the "make love, not war" apes  since they have frequent, promiscuous  and bisexual sex  to manage conflict  and solve social issues. Now, I'm not saying this is the solution  to all of humanity's problems --  since there's more to bonobo life  than the Kama Sutra. Bonobos, like humans,  love to play throughout their entire lives. Play is not just child's games. For us and them,  play is foundational for bonding relationships  and fostering tolerance. It's where we learn to trust  and where we learn about the rules of the game. Play increases creativity  and resilience,  and it's all about the generation of diversity --  diversity of interactions,  diversity of behaviors,  diversity of connections. And when you watch bonobo play,  you're seeing the very evolutionary roots  of human laughter, dance  and ritual. Play is the glue  that binds us together. Now, I don't know how you play,  but I want to show you a couple of unique clips  fresh from the wild. First, it's a ball game bonobo-style --  and I do not mean football. So here,  we have a young female and a male  engaged in a chase game. Have a look what she's doing. It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase,  "she's got him by the balls." Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right? Yeah. So sex play is common  in both bonobos and humans. And this video is really interesting  because it shows --  this video's really interesting  because it shows the inventiveness  of bringing unusual elements into play --  such as testicles --  and also how play both requires trust  and fosters trust --  while at the same time being tremendous fun. But play's a shapeshifter. Play's a shapeshifter,  and it can take many forms,  some of which are more quiet,  imaginative, curious --  maybe where wonder is discovered anew. And I want you to see,  this is Fuku, a young female,  and she is quietly playing with water. I think, like her,  we sometimes play alone,  and we explore the boundaries  of our inner and our outer worlds. And it's that playful curiosity  that drives us to explore, drives us to interact,  and then the unexpected connections we form  are the real hotbed for creativity. So these are just small tasters  into the insights that bonobo give us  to our past and present. But they also hold a secret for our future,  a future where we need to adapt  to an increasingly challenging world  through greater creativity  and greater cooperation. The secret is that play is the key  to these capacities. In other words,  play is our adaptive wildcard. In order to adapt successfully  to a changing world,  we need to play. But will we make the most of our playfulness? Play is not frivolous. Play's essential. For bonobos and humans alike,  life is not just red in tooth and claw. In times when it seems least appropriate to play,  it might be the times when it is most urgent. And so, my fellow primates,  let us embrace this gift from evolution  and play together,  as we rediscover creativity,  fellowship and wonder. Thank you. 
Back in New York, I am the head of development  for a non-profit called Robin Hood. When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires  as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company. Now in our town,  where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,  you have to get to the fire scene pretty early  to get in on any action. I remember my first fire. I was the second volunteer on the scene,  so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in. But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers  to get to the captain in charge  to find out what our assignments would be. When I found the captain,  he was having a very engaging conversation  with the homeowner,  who was surely having one of the worst days of her life. Here it was, the middle of the night,  she was standing outside in the pouring rain,  under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot,  while her house was in flames. The other volunteer who had arrived just before me --  let's call him Lex Luther --    got to the captain first  and was asked to go inside  and save the homeowner's dog. The dog! I was stunned with jealousy. Here was some lawyer or money manager  who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people  that he went into a burning building  to save a living creature,  just because he beat me by five seconds. Well, I was next. The captain waved me over. He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house. I need you to go upstairs, past the fire,  and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes." I swear. So, not exactly what I was hoping for,  but off I went --  up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters,  who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point,  into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes. Now I know what you're thinking,  but I'm no hero. I carried my payload back downstairs  where I met my nemesis  and the precious dog by the front door. We took our treasures outside to the homeowner,  where, not surprisingly,  his received much more attention than did mine. A few weeks later,  the department received a letter from the homeowner  thanking us for the valiant effort displayed  in saving her home. The act of kindness she noted above all others:  someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes. In both my vocation at Robin Hood  and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter,  I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness  on a monumental scale,  but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage  on an individual basis. And you know what I've learned? They all matter. So as I look around this room  at people who either have achieved,  or are on their way to achieving,  remarkable levels of success,  I would offer this reminder:  don't wait. Don't wait until you make your first million  to make a difference in somebody's life. If you have something to give,  give it now. Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park. Be a mentor. Not every day is going to offer us a chance  to save somebody's life,  but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one. So get in the game. Save the shoes. Thank you. Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back. Mark Bezos: Thank you. 
This may sound strange,  but I'm a big fan of the concrete block. The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868  with a very simple idea:  modules made of cement of a fixed measurement  that fit together. Very quickly concrete blocks became  the most-used construction unit in the world. They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,  buildings, bridges,  one brick at a time. Essentially concrete blocks had become  the building block of our time. Almost a hundred years later in 1947,  LEGO came up with this. It was called the Automatic Binding Brick. And in a few short years,  LEGO bricks took place in every household. It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --  or 75 bricks for every person on the planet. You don't have to be an engineer  to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings. LEGO made it accessible. LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,  and made it into the building block  of our imagination. Meanwhile the exact same year,  at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,  the next building block. The transistor was a small plastic unit  that would take us from a world  of static bricks piled on top of each other  to a world where everything was interactive. Like the concrete block,  the transistor allows you to build  much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time. But there's a main difference:  The transistor was only for experts. I personally don't accept this,  that the building block of our time  is reserved for experts,  so I decided to change that. Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,  I started exploring this idea  of how to put the power of engineers  in the hands of artists and designers. A few years ago I started developing littleBits. Let me show you how they work. LittleBits are electronic modules  with each one specific function. They're pre-engineered  to be light, sound,  motors and sensors. And the best part about it  is they snap together with magnets. So you can't put them the wrong way. The bricks are color-coded. Green is output, blue is power,  pink is input and orange is wire. So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green  and very quickly you can start making larger circuits. You put a blue to a green,  you can make light. You can put a knob in between  and now you've made a little dimmer. Switch out the knob  for a pulse module,  which is here,  and now you've made a little blinker. Add this buzzer  for some extra punch  and you've created a noise machine. I'm going to stop that. So beyond simple play,  littleBits are actually pretty powerful. Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,  littleBits allow you to program  using very simple intuitive gestures. So to make this blink faster or slower,  you would just turn this knob  and basically make it pulse faster or slower. The idea behind littleBits  is that it's a growing library. We want to make every single interaction in the world  into a ready-to-use brick. Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --  everything should be accessible. We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them. And it's been an incredible experience. The nicest thing is how they start to understand  the electronics around them from everyday  that they don't learn at schools. For example, how a nightlight works,  or why an elevator door stays open,  or how an iPod responds to touch. We've also been taking littleBits to design schools. So for example, we've had designers  with no experience with electronics whatsoever  start to play with littleBits as a material. Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,  we have Geordie making ... A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD  and gave them to some designers  with no experience in engineering whatsoever --  just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something." Here's an example of a project they made,  a motion-activated confetti canon ball. But wait, this is actually my favorite project. It's a lobster made of playdough  that's afraid of the dark. To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,  electronics became just another material. And we want to make this material accessible to everyone. So littleBits is open-source. You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself. We want to encourage a world  of creators, of inventors, of contributors,  because this world that we live in,  this interactive world, is ours. So go ahead and start inventing. Thank you. 
Today I'm going to talk  about unexpected discoveries. Now I work in the solar technology industry. And my small startup  is looking to force ourselves  into the environment  by paying attention to ... ... paying attention to crowd-sourcing. It's just a quick video  of what we do. Huh. Hang on a moment. It might take a moment to load. We'll just -- we can just skip --  I'll just skip through the video instead ... No. This is not ... Okay. Solar technology is ... Oh, that's all my time? Okay. Thank you very much. 
So a couple of years ago I started a program  to try to get the rockstar tech and design people  and work in the one environment  that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate;  we have them work in government. The program is called Code for America,  and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks. We select a few fellows every year  and we have them work with city governments. Instead of sending them off into the Third World,  we send them into the wilds of City Hall. And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers. But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible  with technology today. So meet Al. Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston. Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date,  but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in,  because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires  when he's covered in four feet of snow. Now how did he come to be looking for help  in this very unique manner? We had a team of fellows in Boston last year  through the Code for America program. They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year. And they noticed that the city never gets  to digging out these fire hydrants. But one fellow in particular,  a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober,  noticed something else,  and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks  right in front of these things. So he did what any good developer would do,  he wrote an app. It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant. So you agree to dig it out when it snows. If you do, you get to name it,  and he called the first one Al. And if you don't, someone can steal it from you. So it's got cute little game dynamics on it. This is a modest little app. It's probably the smallest  of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year. But it's doing something  that no other government technology does. It's spreading virally. There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu  who saw this app and realized  that he could use it, not for snow,  but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens. It's very important that these tsunami sirens work,  but people steal the batteries out of them. So he's getting citizens to check on them. And then Seattle decided to use it  to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains. And Chicago just rolled it out  to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows. So we now know of nine cities  that are planning to use this. And this has spread just frictionlessly,  organically, naturally. If you know anything about government technology,  you know that this isn't how it normally goes. Procuring software usually takes a couple of years. We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year  that took three people about two and a half months. It was a way that parents could figure out  which were the right public schools for their kids. We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels,  it would have taken at least two years  and it would have cost about two million dollars. And that's nothing. There is one project in the California court system right now  that so far cost taxpayers  two billion dollars,  and it doesn't work. And there are projects like this  at every level of government. So an app that takes a couple of days to write  and then spreads virally, that's sort of a shot across the bow  to the institution of government. It suggests how government could work better --  not more like a private company,  as many people think it should. And not even like a tech company,  but more like the Internet itself. And that means permissionless,  it means open, it means generative. And that's important. But what's more important about this app  is that it represents how a new generation  is tackling the problem of government --  not as the problem of an ossified institution,  but as a problem of collective action. And that's great news,  because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action  with digital technology. Now there's a very large community of people  that are building the tools that we need  to do things together effectively. It's not just Code for America fellows,  there are hundreds of people all over the country  that are standing and writing civic apps  every day in their own communities. They haven't given up on government. They are frustrated as hell with it,  but they're not complaining about it,  they're fixing it. And these folks know something  that we've lost sight of. And that's that when you strip away all your feelings  about politics and the line at the DMV  and all those other things  that we're really mad about,  government is, at its core,  in the words of Tim O'Reilly,  "What we do together that we can't do alone." Now a lot of people have given up on government. And if you're one of those people,  I would ask that you reconsider,  because things are changing. Politics is not changing;  government is changing. And because government  ultimately derives its power from us --  remember "We the people?" --  how we think about it  is going to effect how that change happens. Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program. And like a lot of people,  I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office. Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion  that, especially local government,  is about opossums. This is the call center for the services and information line. It's generally where you will get  if you call 311 in your city. If you should ever have the chance  to staff your city's call center,  as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program --  in fact, they all do that --  you will find that people call government  with a very wide range of issues,  including having an opossum stuck in your house. So Scott gets this call. He types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base. He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control. And finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house  and play music really loud  and see if the thing leaves?" So that worked. So booya for Scott. But that wasn't the end of the opossums. Boston doesn't just have a call center. It has an app, a Web and mobile app,  called Citizens Connect. Now we didn't write this app. This is the work of the very smart people  at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston. So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in:  "Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead. How do I get this removed?" But what happens with Citizens Connect is different. So Scott was speaking person-to-person. But on Citizens Connect everything is public,  so everybody can see this. And in this case, a neighbor saw it. And the next report we got said,  "I walked over to this location,  found the trashcan behind the house. Opossum? Check. Living? Yep. Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home. Goodnight sweet opossum." Pretty simple. So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical. And it's also a great example  of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game. But it's also a great example of government as a platform. And I don't mean necessarily  a technological definition of platform here. I'm just talking about a platform for people  to help themselves and to help others. So one citizen helped another citizen,  but government played a key role here. It connected those two people. And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed,  but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative  to government services. When one neighbor helps another,  we strengthen our communities. We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money. Now one of the important things we need to think about government  is that it's not the same thing as politics. And most people get that,  but they think that one is the input to the other. That our input to the system of government  is voting. Now how many times have we elected a political leader --  and sometimes we spend a lot of energy  getting a new political leader elected --  and then we sit back and we expect government  to reflect our values and meet our needs,  and then not that much changes? That's because government is like a vast ocean  and politics is the six-inch layer on top. And what's under that  is what we call bureaucracy. And we say that word with such contempt. But it's that contempt  that keeps this thing that we own  and we pay for  as something that's working against us, this other thing,  and then we're disempowering ourselves. People seem to think politics is sexy. If we want this institution to work for us,  we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy. Because that's where the real work of government happens. We have to engage with the machinery of government. So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done. Have you seen these guys? It's a group of concerned citizens  that have written a very detailed  325-page report  that's a response to the SEC's request for comment  on the Financial Reform Bill. That's not being politically active,  that's being bureaucratically active. Now for those of us who've given up on government,  it's time that we asked ourselves  about the world that we want to leave for our children. You have to see the enormous challenges  that they're going to face. Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go  without fixing the one institution  that can act on behalf of all of us? We can't do without government,  but we do need it  to be more effective. The good news is that technology is making it possible  to fundamentally reframe  the function of government  in a way that can actually scale  by strengthening civil society. And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet,  and they know that it's not that hard  to do things together,  you just have to architect the systems the right way. Now the average age of our fellows is 28,  so I am, begrudgingly,  almost a generation older than most of them. This is a generation  that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted. They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting  about who gets to speak;  they all get to speak. They can express their opinion  on any channel at any time,  and they do. So when they're faced with the problem of government,  they don't care as much  about using their voices. They're using their hands. They're using their hands  to write applications that make government work better. And those applications let us use our hands  to make our communities better. That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed,  turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it. And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along,  and many people do. But these apps are like little digital reminders  that we're not just consumers,  and we're not just consumers of government,  putting in our taxes and getting back services. We're more than that,  we're citizens. And we're not going to fix government  until we fix citizenship. So the question I have for all of you here:  When it comes to the big, important things  that we need to do together,  all of us together,  are we just going to be a crowd of voices,  or are we also going to be  a crowd of hands? Thank you. 
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me. I spend most of my time  in jails, in prisons, on death row. I spend most of my time in very low-income communities  in the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness. And being here at TED  and seeing the stimulation, hearing it,  has been very, very energizing to me. And one of the things that's emerged in my short time here  is that TED has an identity. And you can actually say things here  that have impacts around the world. And sometimes when it comes through TED,  it has meaning and power  that it doesn't have when it doesn't. And I mention that because I think identity is really important. And we've had some fantastic presentations. And I think what we've learned  is that, if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful,  but if you're a compassionate teacher,  they can be especially meaningful. If you're a doctor you can do some good things,  but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things. And so I want to talk about the power of identity. And I didn't learn about this actually  practicing law and doing the work that I do. I actually learned about this from my grandmother. I grew up in a house  that was the traditional African-American home  that was dominated by a matriarch,  and that matriarch was my grandmother. She was tough, she was strong,  she was powerful. She was the end of every argument in our family. She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family. She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved. Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840's. She was born in the 1880's  and the experience of slavery  very much shaped the way she saw the world. And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving. When I would see her as a little boy,  she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs. And she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe  and then she'd let me go. And an hour or two later, if I saw her,  she'd come over to me and she'd say, "Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?" And if I said, "No," she'd assault me again,  and if I said, "Yes," she'd leave me alone. And she just had this quality  that you always wanted to be near her. And the only challenge was that she had 10 children. My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids. And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her,  it would be difficult to get her time and attention. My cousins would be running around everywhere. And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old,  waking up one morning, going into the living room,  and all of my cousins were running around. And my grandmother was sitting across the room  staring at me. And at first I thought we were playing a game. And I would look at her and I'd smile,  but she was very serious. And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this,  she got up and she came across the room  and she took me by the hand  and she said, "Come on, Bryan. You and I are going to have a talk." And I remember this just like it happened yesterday. I never will forget it. She took me out back and she said, "Bryan, I'm going to tell you something,  but you don't tell anybody what I tell you." I said, "Okay, Mama." She said, "Now you make sure you don't do that." I said, "Sure." Then she sat me down and she looked at me  and she said, "I want you to know  I've been watching you." And she said, "I think you're special." She said, "I think you can do anything you want to do." I will never forget it. And then she said, "I just need you to promise me three things, Bryan." I said, "Okay, Mama." She said, "The first thing I want you to promise me  is that you'll always love your mom." She said, "That's my baby girl,  and you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her." Well I adored my mom, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that." Then she said, "The second thing I want you to promise me  is that you'll always do the right thing  even when the right thing is the hard thing." And I thought about it and I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that." Then finally she said, "The third thing I want you to promise me  is that you'll never drink alcohol." Well I was nine years old, so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that." I grew up in the country in the rural South,  and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger. When I was about 14 or 15,  one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer --  I don't know where he got it --  and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods. And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did. And he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some,  and they offered it to me. I said, "No, no, no. That's okay. You all go ahead. I'm not going to have any beer." My brother said, "Come on. We're doing this today; you always do what we do. I had some, your sister had some. Have some beer." I said, "No, I don't feel right about that. Y'all go ahead. Y'all go ahead." And then my brother started staring at me. He said, "What's wrong with you? Have some beer." Then he looked at me real hard and he said,  "Oh, I hope you're not still hung up  on that conversation Mama had with you." I said, "Well, what are you talking about?" He said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special." I was devastated. And I'm going to admit something to you. I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't. I know this might be broadcast broadly. But I'm 52 years old,  and I'm going to admit to you  that I've never had a drop of alcohol. I don't say that because I think that's virtuous;  I say that because there is power in identity. When we create the right kind of identity,  we can say things to the world around us  that they don't actually believe makes sense. We can get them to do things  that they don't think they can do. When I thought about my grandmother,  of course she would think all her grandkids were special. My grandfather was in prison during prohibition. My male uncles died of alcohol-related diseases. And these were the things she thought we needed to commit to. Well I've been trying to say something  about our criminal justice system. than it was 40 years ago. In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons. Today, there are 2.3 million. The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration  We have seven million people on probation and parole. And mass incarceration, in my judgment,  has fundamentally changed our world. In poor communities, in communities of color  there is this despair,  there is this hopelessness,  that is being shaped by these outcomes. One out of three black men  between the ages of 18 and 30  is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole. In urban communities across this country --  Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington --  50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are  in jail or prison or on probation or parole. Our system isn't just being shaped  in these ways that seem to be distorting around race,  they're also distorted by poverty. We have a system of justice in this country  that treats you much better  if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. Wealth, not culpability,  shapes outcomes. And yet, we seem to be very comfortable. The politics of fear and anger  have made us believe  that these are problems that are not our problems. We've been disconnected. It's interesting to me. We're looking at some very interesting developments in our work. My state of Alabama, like a number of states,  if you have a criminal conviction. Right now in Alabama  34 percent of the black male population  has permanently lost the right to vote. We're actually projecting in another 10 years  will be as high as it's been  since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. And there is this stunning silence. I represent children. A lot of my clients are very young. The United States is the only country in the world  where we sentence 13-year-old children  to die in prison. We have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country. And we're actually doing some litigation. The only country in the world. I represent people on death row. It's interesting, this question of the death penalty. In many ways, we've been taught to think  that the real question is,  do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed? And that's a very sensible question. But there's another way of thinking  about where we are in our identity. The other way of thinking about it  is not, do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit,  but do we deserve to kill? I mean, it's fascinating. Death penalty in America is defined by error. For every nine people who have been executed,  we've actually identified one innocent person  who's been exonerated and released from death row. A kind of astonishing error rate --  one out of nine people innocent. I mean, it's fascinating. In aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanes  if for every nine planes that took off  one would crash. But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem. It's not our problem. It's not our burden. It's not our struggle. I talk a lot about these issues. I talk about race and this question  of whether we deserve to kill. And it's interesting, when I teach my students about African-American history,  I tell them about slavery. I tell them about terrorism,  the era that began at the end of reconstruction  that went on to World War II. We don't really know very much about it. But for African-Americans in this country,  that was an era defined by terror. In many communities, people had to worry about being lynched. They had to worry about being bombed. It was the threat of terror that shaped their lives. And these older people come up to me now  and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you give talks, you make speeches,  you tell people to stop saying  we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history  after 9/11." They tell me to say, "No, tell them that we grew up with that." And that era of terrorism, of course,  was followed by segregation  and decades of racial subordination  and apartheid. And yet, we have in this country this dynamic  where we really don't like to talk about our problems. We don't like to talk about our history. And because of that, we really haven't understood  what it's meant to do the things we've done historically. We're constantly running into each other. We're constantly creating tensions and conflicts. We have a hard time talking about race,  and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves  to a process of truth and reconciliation. In South Africa, people understood  that we couldn't overcome apartheid  without a commitment to truth and reconciliation. In Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment,  but in this country we haven't done that. I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty. It was fascinating  because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation  and said, "Well you know it's deeply troubling  to hear what you're talking about." He said, "We don't have the death penalty in Germany. And of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany." And the room got very quiet,  and this woman said,  "There's no way, with our history,  we could ever engage  in the systematic killing of human beings. It would be unconscionable for us  to, in an intentional and deliberate way,  set about executing people." And I thought about that. What would it feel like  to be living in a world  where the nation state of Germany was executing people,  especially if they were disproportionately Jewish? I couldn't bear it. It would be unconscionable. And yet, in this country,  in the states of the Old South,  we execute people --  where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty  if the victim is white than if the victim is black,  if the defendant is black and the victim is white --  in the very states where there are buried in the ground  the bodies of people who were lynched. And yet, there is this disconnect. Well I believe that our identity is at risk. That when we actually don't care  about these difficult things,  the positive and wonderful things  are nonetheless implicated. We love innovation. We love technology. We love creativity. We love entertainment. But ultimately,  those realities  are shadowed by suffering,  abuse, degradation,  marginalization. And for me, it becomes necessary  to integrate the two. Because ultimately we are talking  about a need to be more hopeful,  more committed, more dedicated  to the basic challenges of living in a complex world. And for me that means  spending time thinking and talking  about the poor, the disadvantaged,  those who will never get to TED. But thinking about them in a way  that is integrated in our own lives. You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen. We do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are. Innovation, creativity,  development comes  not from the ideas in our mind alone. They come from the ideas in our mind  that are also fueled  by some conviction in our heart. And it's that mind-heart connection  that I believe compels us  to not just be attentive  to all the bright and dazzly things,  but also the dark and difficult things. Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this. He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression,  we wanted all kinds of things,  but mostly what we needed was hope,  an orientation of the spirit,  a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places  and be a witness." Well that orientation of the spirit  is very much at the core of what I believe  even TED communities  have to be engaged in. There is no disconnect  around technology and design  that will allow us to be fully human  until we pay attention to suffering,  to poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice. Now I will warn you  that this kind of identity  is a much more challenging identity  than ones that don't pay attention to this. It will get to you. I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks. And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then,  and she would get together with two of her dearest friends,  these older women,  Johnnie Carr who was the organizer  of the Montgomery bus boycott --  amazing African-American woman --  and Virginia Durr, a white woman,  whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King. And these women would get together and just talk. And every now and then Ms. Carr would call me,  and she'd say, "Bryan, Ms. Parks is coming to town. We're going to get together and talk. Do you want to come over and listen?" And I'd say, "Yes, Ma'am, I do." And she'd say, "Well what are you going to do when you get here?" I said, "I'm going to listen." And I'd go over there and I would, I would just listen. It would be so energizing and so empowering. And one time I was over there listening to these women talk,  and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me  and she said, "Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is. Tell me what you're trying to do." And I began giving her my rap. I said, "Well we're trying to challenge injustice. We're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted. We're trying to confront bias and discrimination  in the administration of criminal justice. We're trying to end life without parole sentences for children. We're trying to do something about the death penalty. We're trying to reduce the prison population. We're trying to end mass incarceration." I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me  and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm." She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired." And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face,  she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave." And I actually believe that the TED community  needs to be more courageous. We need to find ways  to embrace these challenges,  these problems, the suffering. Because ultimately, our humanity depends  on everyone's humanity. I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do. It's just taught me very simple things. I've come to understand and to believe  that each of us  is more than the worst thing we've ever done. I believe that for every person on the planet. I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar. I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them,  they're not just a thief. I think even if you kill someone, you're not just a killer. And because of that there's this basic human dignity  that must be respected by law. I also believe  that in many parts of this country,  and certainly in many parts of this globe,  that the opposite of poverty is not wealth. I don't believe that. I actually think, in too many places,  the opposite of poverty is justice. And finally, I believe  that, despite the fact that it is so dramatic  and so beautiful and so inspiring  and so stimulating,  we will ultimately not be judged by our technology,  we won't be judged by our design,  we won't be judged by our intellect and reason. Ultimately, you judge the character of a society,  not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged,  but by how they treat the poor,  the condemned, the incarcerated. Because it's in that nexus  that we actually begin to understand truly profound things  about who we are. I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story. I sometimes push too hard. I do get tired, as we all do. Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking  in ways that are important. And I've been representing these kids  who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences. And I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14,  and he's been certified to stand trial as an adult. I start thinking, well, how did that happen? How can a judge turn you into something  that you're not? And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid. And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking,  well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not,  the judge must have magic power. Yeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power. You should ask for some of that. And because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight,  I started working on a motion. And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid. And I started working on this motion,  and the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor,  14-year-old black male client  like a privileged, white 75-year-old  corporate executive." And I put in my motion  that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct. There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county,  it's all misconduct. And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion,  or did I actually write it? And to my horror, not only had I written it,  but I had sent it to court. A couple months went by,  and I had just forgotten all about it. And I finally decided,  oh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case. And I got into my car  and I was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed. And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse. And I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful. And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse. And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse,  there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse. When this man saw me, he came over to me  and he said, "Who are you?" I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir." And this man came over to me  and he hugged me. And he whispered in my ear. He said, "I'm so proud of you." And I have to tell you,  it was energizing. It connected deeply with something in me  about identity,  about the capacity of every person to contribute  to a community, to a perspective that is hopeful. Well I went into the courtroom. And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in. He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?" I said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing. And people started coming in because they were just outraged. I had written these crazy things. And police officers were coming in  and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers. And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people  angry that we were talking about race,  that we were talking about poverty,  that we were talking about inequality. And out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth. And he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler. He kept pacing back and forth. And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face  came into the courtroom and sat down behind me,  almost at counsel table. About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break. And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended  that the janitor had come into court. And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man. He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?" And this older black man stood up  and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me  and he said, "I came into this courtroom  to tell this young man,  keep your eyes on the prize, hold on." I've come to TED  because I believe that many of you understand  that the moral arc of the universe is long,  but it bends toward justice. until we care about human rights and basic dignity. That all of our survival  is tied to the survival of everyone. That our visions of technology and design  and entertainment and creativity  have to be married with visions of humanity, compassion and justice. And more than anything,  for those of you who share that,  I've simply come to tell you  to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson: So you heard and saw  an obvious desire by this audience, this community,  to help you on your way and to do something on this issue. Other than writing a check,  what could we do? BS: Well there are opportunities all around us. If you live in the state of California, for example,  there's a referendum coming up this spring  where actually there's going to be an effort  to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment. For example, here in California  we're going to spend one billion dollars  on the death penalty in the next five years --  one billion dollars. And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases  don't result in arrest. 56 percent of all rape cases don't result. So there's an opportunity to change that. And this referendum would propose having those dollars  go to law enforcement and safety. And I think that opportunity exists all around us. CA: There's been this huge decline  in crime in America over the last three decades. And part of the narrative of that  is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates. What would you say to someone who believed that? BS: Well actually the violent crime rate  has remained relatively stable. The great increase in mass incarceration in this country  wasn't really in violent crime categories. It was this misguided war on drugs. in our prison population. And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment. And so we have three strikes laws  that put people in prison forever  for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes,  rather than making them give those resources back  to the people who they victimized. I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime,  not do less. And I think our current punishment philosophy  does nothing for no one. And I think that's the orientation that we have to change. CA: Bryan, you've struck a massive chord here. You're an inspiring person. Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you. 
Announcer: Threats, in the wake of Bin Laden's death, have spiked. Announcer Two: Famine in Somalia. Announcer Three: Police pepper spray. Announcer Four: Vicious cartels.

Mass destruction. Tornado. Recession. Default. Doomsday. Egypt. Syria. Crisis. Death. Disaster. Oh, my God. Peter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips  I collected over the last six months --  could have easily been the last six days  or the last six years. The point is that the news media  preferentially feeds us negative stories  because that's what our minds pay attention to. And there's a very good reason for that. Every second of every day,  our senses bring in way too much data  than we can possibly process in our brains. And because nothing is more important to us  than survival,  the first stop of all of that data  is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe  called the amygdala. Now the amygdala is our early warning detector,  our danger detector. It sorts and scours through all of the information  looking for anything in the environment that might harm us. So given a dozen news stories,  we will preferentially look  at the negative news. And that old newspaper saying,  "If it bleeds it leads,"  is very true. So given all of our digital devices  that are bringing all the negative news to us  it's no wonder that we're pessimistic. It's no wonder that people think  that the world is getting worse. But perhaps that's not the case. Perhaps instead,  it's the distortions brought to us  of what's really going on. Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century  by a series of forces  are, in fact, accelerating to a point  that we have the potential in the next three decades  to create a world of abundance. Now I'm not saying  we don't have our set of problems --  climate crisis, species extinction,  water and energy shortage -- we surely do. And as humans, we are far better  at seeing the problems way in advance,  but ultimately we knock them down. So let's look  at what this last century has been  to see where we're going. Over the last hundred years,  the average human lifespan has more than doubled,  average per capita income adjusted for inflation  around the world has tripled. Childhood mortality  has come down a factor of 10. Add to that the cost of food, electricity,  transportation, communication  have dropped 10 to 1,000-fold. Steve Pinker has showed us  that, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever  in human history. And Charles Kenny  that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent  in the last 130 years. We truly are living in an extraordinary time. And many people forget this. And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher. In fact, we redefine what poverty means. Think of this, in America today,  the majority of people under the poverty line  still have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators,  television, mobile phones,  air conditioning and cars. The wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet,  could have never dreamed of such luxuries. Underpinning much of this  is technology,  and of late,  exponentially growing technologies. My good friend Ray Kurzweil  showed that any tool that becomes an information technology  jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law,  and experiences price performance doubling  every 12 to 24 months. That's why the cellphone in your pocket  is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster  than a supercomputer of the '70s. Now look at this curve. This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years. I want you to notice two things from this curve. Number one, how smooth it is --  through good time and bad time, war time and peace time,  recession, depression and boom time. This is the result of faster computers  being used to build faster computers. It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges. And also, even though it's plotted  on a log curve on the left,  it's curving upwards. The rate at which the technology is getting faster  is itself getting faster. And on this curve, riding on Moore's Law,  are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies  available to all of us. Cloud computing,  what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing;  sensors and networks; robotics;  3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute  personalized production around the planet;  synthetic biology;  fuels, vaccines and foods;  digital medicine; nanomaterials; and A.I. I mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy  by IBM's Watson? I mean, that was epic. In fact, I scoured the headlines  looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could. And I love this: "Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents." Jeopardy's not an easy game. It's about the nuance of human language. And imagine if you would  A.I.'s like this on the cloud  available to every person with a cellphone. Four years ago here at TED,  Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university  called Singularity University. And we teach our students all of these technologies,  and particularly how they can be used  to solve humanity's grand challenges. And every year we ask them  to start a company or a product or a service  that can affect positively the lives of a billion people  within a decade. Think about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students  can touch the lives of a billion people today. 30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous. Today we can point at dozens of companies  that have done just that. When I think about creating abundance,  it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet;  it's about creating a life of possibility. It is about taking that which was scarce  and making it abundant. You see, scarcity is contextual,  and technology is a resource-liberating force. Let me give you an example. So this is a story of Napoleon III  in the mid-1800s. He's the dude on the left. He invited over to dinner  the king of Siam. All of Napoleon's troops  were fed with silver utensils,  Napoleon himself with gold utensils. But the King of Siam,  he was fed with aluminum utensils. You see, aluminum  was the most valuable metal on the planet,  worth more than gold and platinum. It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument  is made of aluminum. You see, even though aluminum  is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass,  it doesn't come as a pure metal. It's all bound by oxygen and silicates. But then the technology of electrolysis came along  and literally made aluminum so cheap  that we use it with throw-away mentality. So let's project this analogy going forward. We think about energy scarcity. Ladies and gentlemen,  we are on a planet  that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy  than we use in a year. 16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface  every 88 minutes. It's not about being scarce,  it's about accessibility. And there's good news here. For the first time, this year  the cost of solar-generated electricity  is 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India --  8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees. The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year. Last month, MIT put out a study  showing that by the end of this decade,  in the sunny parts of the United States,  solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour  compared to 15 cents  as a national average. And if we have abundant energy,  we also have abundant water. Now we talk about water wars. Do you remember  when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft  back towards the Earth,  in 1990 after it just passed Saturn? He took a famous photo. What was it called? "A Pale Blue Dot." Because we live on a water planet. We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water. Yes, 97.5 percent is saltwater,  two percent is ice,  and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet,  but here too there is hope. And there is technology coming online,  not 10, 20 years from now,  right now. There's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials. And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning,  one of the great DIY innovators,  I'd like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so --  his technology called Slingshot  that many of you may have heard of,  it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator. a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day  out of any source -- saltwater, polluted water, latrine --  at less than two cents a liter. The chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed  to do a major test  of hundreds of units of this in the developing world. And if that pans out,  which I have every confidence it will,  Coca-Cola will deploy this globally  to 206 countries  around the planet. This is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology,  that exists today. And we've seen this in cellphones. My goodness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetration  of cellphones in the developing world  by the end of 2013. Think about it,  that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya  than President Reagan did 25 years ago. And if they're on a smartphone on Google,  they've got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago. They're living in a world of information and communication abundance  that no one could have ever predicted. Better than that,  the things that you and I  spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for --  GPS, HD video and still images,  libraries of books and music,  medical diagnostic technology --  are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing  into your cellphone. Probably the best part of it  is what's coming down the pike in health. Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation  something called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize. We're challenging teams around the world  to basically combine these technologies  into a mobile device  that you can speak to, because it's got A.I.,  you can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick. And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better  than a team of board-certified doctors. So literally, imagine this device  in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, 25 percent of the disease burden  and 1.3 percent of the health care workers. When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus  that it doesn't recognize,  it calls the CDC  and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place. But here, here is the biggest force  for bringing about a world of abundance. I call it the rising billion. So the white lines here are population. We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth. And by the way,  the biggest protection against a population explosion  is making the world educated  and healthy. In 2010,  we had just short of two billion people  online, connected. By 2020,  that's going from two billion to five billion  Internet users. Three billion new minds  who have never been heard from before  are connecting to the global conversation. What will these people want? What will they consume? What will they desire? And rather than having economic shutdown,  we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever. These people represent  tens of trillions of dollars  injected into the global economy. And they will get healthier  and they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy,  3D printing and infinite computing  [become] more productive than ever before. So what could three billion rising,  healthy, educated, productive members of humanity  bring to us? How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before. What about giving the oppressed,  wherever they might be,  the voice to be heard and the voice to act  for the first time ever? What will these three billion people bring? What about contributions we can't even predict? The one thing I've learned at the X Prize  driven by their passion with a clear focus  can do extraordinary things,  things that large corporations and governments  could only do in the past. Let me share and close with a story  that really got me excited. There is a program that some of you might have heard of. It's a game called Foldit. It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle. And this is a game  where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids  and figure out how the protein is going to fold. And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality. And it's very important for research in medicine. And up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem. And this game has been played  by university professors and so forth. And it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people  came online and started playing it. And it showed that, in fact, today,  the human pattern recognition machinery  is better at folding proteins than the best computers. And when these individuals went and looked  at who was the best protein folder in the world,  it wasn't an MIT professor,  it wasn't a CalTech student,  it was a person from England, from Manchester,  a woman who, during the day,  was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic  and, at night, was the world's best protein folder. Ladies and gentlemen,  what gives me tremendous confidence  in the future  is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals  to take on the grand challenges of this planet. We have the tools with this exponential technology. We have the passion of the DIY innovator. We have the capital of the techno-philanthropist. And we have three billion new minds  coming online to work with us  to solve the grand challenges,  to do that which we must do. We are living into extraordinary decades ahead. Thank you. 
I'm going to speak  about a tiny, little idea. And this is about shifting baseline. And because the idea can be explained in one minute,  I will tell you three stories before  to fill in the time. And the first story  is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes. And he was here, as you well know, in '35. And you'd think he was chasing finches,  but he wasn't. He was actually collecting fish. And he described one of them  as very "common." This was the sailfin grouper. A big fishery was run on it  until the '80s. Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List. Now this story,  we have heard it lots of times  on Galapagos and other places,  so there is nothing particular about it. But the point is, we still come to Galapagos. We still think it is pristine. The brochures still say  it is untouched. So what happens here? The second story, also to illustrate another concept,  is called shifting waistline. Because I was there in '71,  studying a lagoon in West Africa. I was there because I grew up in Europe  and I wanted later to work in Africa. And I thought I could blend in. And I got a big sunburn,  and I was convinced that I was really not from there. This was my first sunburn. And the lagoon  was surrounded by palm trees,  as you can see, and a few mangrove. And it had tilapia  about 20 centimeters,  a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia. And the fisheries for this tilapia  sustained lots of fish and they had a good time  and they earned more than average  in Ghana. When I went there 27 years later,  the fish had shrunk to half of their size. They were maturing at five centimeters. They had been pushed genetically. There were still fishes. They were still kind of happy. And the fish also were happy to be there. So nothing has changed,  but everything has changed. My third little story  is that I was an accomplice  in the introduction of trawling  in Southeast Asia. In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s --  Europe did lots of development projects. Fish development  meant imposing on countries  that had already 100,000 fishers  to impose on them industrial fishing. And this boat, quite ugly,  is called the Mutiara 4. And I went sailing on it,  and we did surveys  throughout the southern South China sea  and especially the Java Sea. And what we caught,  we didn't have words for it. What we caught, I know now,  is the bottom of the sea. And 90 percent of our catch  were sponges,  other animals that are fixed on the bottom. And actually most of the fish,  they are a little spot on the debris,  the piles of debris, were coral reef fish. Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck  and then was thrown down. And these pictures are extraordinary  because this transition is very rapid. Within a year, you do a survey  and then commercial fishing begins. The bottom is transformed  from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral  into a muddy mess. This is a dead turtle. They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead. And one time we caught a live one. It was not drowned yet. And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat. This mountain of debris  is actually collected by fishers  into an area that's never been fished. But it's not documented. We transform the world,  but we don't remember it. We adjust our baseline  to the new level,  and we don't recall what was there. If you generalize this,  something like this happens. You have on the y axis some good thing:  biodiversity, numbers of orca,  the greenness of your country, the water supply. And over time it changes --  it changes  because people do things, or naturally. Every generation  will use the images  that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives  as a standard  and will extrapolate forward. And the difference then,  they perceive as a loss. But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss. You can have a succession of changes. At the end you want to sustain  miserable leftovers. And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now. We want to sustain things that are gone  or things that are not the way they were. Now one should think  this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies,  they killed animals  after a few generations. Because, obviously,  an animal that is very abundant,  before it gets extinct,  it becomes rare. So you don't lose abundant animals. You always lose rare animals. And therefore they're not perceived  as a big loss. Over time,  we concentrate on large animals,  and in a sea that means the big fish. They become rarer because we fish them. Over time we have a few fish left  and we think this is the baseline. And the question is,  why do people accept this? Well because they don't know that it was different. And in fact, lots of people, scientists,  will contest that it was really different. And they will contest this  because the evidence  presented in an earlier mode  is not in the way  they would like the evidence presented. For example,  the anecdote that some present,  as Captain so-and-so  observed lots of fish in this area  cannot be used  or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,  because it's not "scientific." So you have a situation  where people don't know the past,  even though we live in literate societies,  because they don't trust  the sources of the past. And hence, the enormous role  that a marine protected area can play. Because with marine protected areas,  we actually recreate the past. We recreate the past that people cannot conceive  because the baseline has shifted  and is extremely low. That is for people  who can see a marine protected area  and who can benefit  from the insight that it provides,  which enables them to reset their baseline. How about the people who can't do that  because they have no access --  the people in the Midwest for example? There I think  that the arts and film  can perhaps fill the gap,  and simulation. This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay. There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago --  500 years ago. And you will have noticed that the hues and tones  are like "Avatar." And if you think about "Avatar,"  if you think of why people were so touched by it --  never mind the Pocahontas story --  why so touched by the imagery? Because it evokes something  that in a sense has been lost. And so my recommendation,  it's the only one I will provide,  is for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater. Thank you very much. 
Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube,  and I professionally watch YouTube videos. It's true. So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral  and then why that even matters. We all want to be stars --  celebrities, singers, comedians --  and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do. But now Web video has made it  so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do  can become completely famous  in a part of our world's culture. Any one of you could be famous on the Internet  by next Saturday. But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube  every minute. And of that, only a tiny percentage  ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment. So how does it happen? Three things:  tastemakers, communities of participation  and unexpectedness. All right, let's go. Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Wooo! Ohhhhh, wowwww! KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video  that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park. In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times. This is a chart of what it looked like  when it first became popular last summer. But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear. He just wanted to share a rainbow. Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear. And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact. And this video had actually been posted  all the way back in January. So what happened here? Jimmy Kimmel actually. Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet  that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become. Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel  introduce us to new and interesting things  and bring them to a larger audience. Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. ♫  ♫ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. ♫  ♫ Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday. ♫  KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation  without talking about this video I hope. Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year. It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year. This is a chart of what it looked like. And similar to "Double Rainbow,"  it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere. So what happened on this day? Well it was a Friday, this is true. And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays. But what about this day,  this one particular Friday? Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about. Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater  was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter. But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers  took a point of view  and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process. And so then this community formed  of people who shared this big inside joke  and they started talking about it and doing things with it. And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube. Even in the first seven days,  there was one parody for every other day of the week. Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century,  this community participation  is how we become a part of the phenomenon --  either by spreading it or by doing something new with it. So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation  with looped music. It's this, just like this. It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year. And if you think that that is weird,  you should know that there is a three-hour version of this  that's been viewed four million times. Even cats were watching this video. Cats were watching other cats watch this video. But what's important here  is the creativity that it inspired  amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture. There were remixes. Someone made an old timey version. And then it went international. An entire remix community sprouted up  that brought it from being just a stupid joke  to something that we can all actually be a part of. Because we don't just enjoy now,  we participate. And who could have predicted any of this? Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black  or "Nyan Cat?" What scripts could you have written  that would have contained this in it? In a world where over two days of video  get uploaded every minute,  only that which is truly unique and unexpected  can stand out in the way that these things have. When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video  about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City,  I admit I wasn't very interested. Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane,  but often there are obstructions  that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane. KA: By being totally surprising and humorous,  Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point  seen five million times. And so this approach holds  for anything new that we do creatively. And so it all brings us  to one big question ... Bear Vasquez: What does this mean? Ohhhh. KA: What does it mean? Tastemakers, creative participating communities,  complete unexpectedness,  these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture  where anyone has access  and the audience defines the popularity. I mean, as mentioned earlier,  one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber,  got his start on YouTube. No one has to green-light your idea. And we all now feel some ownership  in our own pop culture. And these are not characteristics of old media,  and they're barely true of the media of today,  but they will define the entertainment of the future. Thank you. 
How can I speak in 10 minutes  about the bonds of women over three generations,  about how the astonishing strength of those bonds  took hold in the life  of a four-year-old girl  huddled with her young sister,  her mother and her grandmother  for five days and nights  in a small boat in the China Sea  more than 30 years ago,  bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go --  that small girl now living in San Francisco  and speaking to you today? This is not a finished story. It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together. Let me tell you about some of the pieces. Imagine the first piece:  a man burning his life's work. He is a poet, a playwright,  a man whose whole life  had been balanced on the single hope  of his country's unity and freedom. Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon,  confronting the fact  that his life had been a complete waste. Words, for so long his friends, now mocked him. He retreated into silence. He died broken by history. He is my grandfather. I never knew him in real life. But our lives are much more than our memories. My grandmother never let me forget his life. My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain,  and my lesson was to learn  that, yes, history tried to crush us,  but we endured. The next piece of the jigsaw  is of a boat in the early dawn  slipping silently out to sea. My mother, Mai, was 18  when her father died --  already in an arranged marriage,  already with two small girls. For her, life had distilled itself into one task:  the escape of her family  and a new life in Australia. It was inconceivable to her  that she would not succeed. So after a four-year saga that defies fiction,  a boat slipped out to sea  disguised as a fishing vessel. All the adults knew the risks. The greatest fear was of pirates,  rape and death. Like most adults on the boat,  my mother carried a small bottle of poison. If we were captured, first my sister and I,  then she and my grandmother would drink. My first memories are from the boat --  the steady beat of the engine,  the bow dipping into each wave,  the vast and empty horizon. I don't remember the pirates who came many times,  but were bluffed by the bravado  of the men on our boat,  or the engine dying  and failing to start for six hours. But I do remember the lights on the oil rig  off the Malaysian coast  and the young man who collapsed and died,  the journey's end too much for him,  and the first apple I tasted,  given to me by the men on the rig. No apple has ever tasted the same. After three months in a refugee camp,  we landed in Melbourne. And the next piece of the jigsaw  is about four women across three generations  shaping a new life together. We settled in Footscray,  a working-class suburb  whose demographic is layers of immigrants. Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs,  whose existence I was oblivious of,  there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray. The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world. And the snippets of halting English  were exchanged between people  who had one thing in common,  they were starting again. My mother worked on farms,  then on a car assembly line,  working six days, double shifts. Somehow she found time to study English  and gain IT qualifications. We were poor. All the dollars were allocated  and extra tuition in English and mathematics  was budgeted for  regardless of what missed out,  which was usually new clothes;  they were always secondhand. Two pairs of stockings for school,  each to hide the holes in the other. A school uniform down to the ankles,  because it had to last for six years. And there were rare but searing chants  of "slit-eye"  and the occasional graffiti:  "Asian, go home." Go home to where? Something stiffened inside me. There was a gathering of resolve  and a quiet voice saying, "I will bypass you." My mother, my sister and I  slept in the same bed. My mother was exhausted each night,  but we told one another about our day  and listened to the movements  of my grandmother around the house. My mother suffered from nightmares  all about the boat. And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came  so I could wake her. She opened a computer store  then studied to be a beautician  and opened another business. And the women came with their stories  about men who could not make the transition,  angry and inflexible,  and troubled children caught between two worlds. Grants and sponsors were sought. Centers were established. I lived in parallel worlds. In one, I was the classic Asian student,  relentless in the demands that I made on myself. In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious,  tragically scarred by violence,  drug abuse and isolation. But so many over the years were helped. And for that work, when I was a final year law student,  I was chosen as the young Australian of the year. And I was catapulted  from one piece of the jigsaw to another,  and their edges didn't fit. Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident,  was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist,  invited to speak in venues she had never heard of  and into homes whose existence  she could never have imagined. I didn't know the protocols. I didn't know how to use the cutlery. I didn't know how to talk about wine. I didn't know how to talk about anything. I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort  of life in an unsung suburb --  a grandmother, a mother and two daughters  ending each day as they had for almost 20 years,  telling one another the story of their day  and falling asleep,  the three of us still in the same bed. I told my mother I couldn't do it. She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been  when we boarded the boat. No had never been an option. "Just do it," she said,  "and don't be what you're not." So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education  and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised. And the more candidly I spoke,  the more I was asked to speak. I met people from all walks of life,  so many of them doing the thing they loved,  living on the frontiers of possibility. And even though I finished my degree,  I realized I could not settle into a career in law. There had to be another piece of the jigsaw. And I realized at the same time  that it is okay to be an outsider,  a recent arrival,  new on the scene --  and not just okay,  but something to be thankful for,  perhaps a gift from the boat. Because being an insider  can so easily mean collapsing the horizons,  can so easily mean  accepting the presumptions of your province. I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now  to know that, yes, the world does fall apart,  but not in the way that you fear. Possibilities that would not have been allowed  were outrageously encouraged. There was an energy there,  an implacable optimism,  a strange mixture of humility and daring. So I followed my hunches. I gathered around me a small team of people  for whom the label "It can't be done"  was an irresistible challenge. For a year we were penniless. At the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup  which we all shared. We worked well into each night. Most of our ideas were crazy,  but a few were brilliant,  and we broke through. I made the decision to move to the U.S. after only one trip. My hunches again. Three months later I had relocated,  and the adventure has continued. Before I close though,  let me tell you about my grandmother. She grew up at a time  when Confucianism was the social norm  and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered. Life hadn't changed for centuries. Her father died soon after she was born. Her mother raised her alone. At 17 she became the second wife  of a Mandarin whose mother beat her. With no support from her husband,  she caused a sensation by taking him to court  and prosecuting her own case,  and a far greater sensation when she won. "It can't be done" was shown to be wrong. I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney  I looked through the shower screen  and saw her standing on the other side. I knew she had come to say goodbye. My mother phoned minutes later. A few days later,  we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray  and sat around her casket. We told her stories  and assured her that we were still with her. At midnight the monk came  and told us he had to close the casket. My mother asked us to feel her hand. She asked the monk,  "Why is it that her hand is so warm  and the rest of her is so cold?" "Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said. "You have not let it go." If there is a sinew in our family,  it runs through the women. Given who we were and how life had shaped us,  we can now see  that the men who might have come into our lives  would have thwarted us. Defeat would have come too easily. Now I would like to have my own children,  and I wonder about the boat. Who could ever wish it on their own? Yet I am afraid of privilege,  of ease,  of entitlement. Can I give them a bow in their lives,  dipping bravely into each wave,  the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine,  the vast horizon  that guarantees nothing? I don't know. But if I could give it  and still see them safely through,  I would. Trevor Neilson: And also, Tan's mother is here today  in the fourth or fifth row. 
My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan  about two years ago. I was in the desert, under the starry skies  with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali. And we were in conversation  about how nothing had changed  since the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata." So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel  we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky. Now we do the same with airplanes. Back then,  when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince,  when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow,  he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out. Now we do the same  with drills and machines. The conclusion that we came to  was that magic had been replaced  by machinery. And this made me really sad. I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe. I was terrified by this idea  that I would lose the ability  to enjoy and appreciate the sunset  without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends. And it felt like technology  should enable magic, not kill it. When I was a little girl,  my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch. And this piece of 50-year-old technology  became the most magical thing to me. It became a gilded gateway  into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks  and images in my imagination. So I felt like our cellphones  and our fancy watches and our cameras  had stopped us from dreaming. They stopped us from being inspired. And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology,  to see how I could use it to enable magic  as opposed to kill it. I've been illustrating books since I was 16. And so when I saw the iPad,  I saw it as a storytelling device  that could connect readers all over the world. It can know how we're holding it. It can know where we are. It brings together image and text  and animation and sound and touch. Storytelling is becoming  more and more multi-sensorial. But what are we doing with it? So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya,  an interactive app for the iPad. So it says, "Place your fingers  upon each light." And so --    It says, "This box belongs to ... "  And so I type in my name. And actually I become a character in the book. At various points, a little letter drops down to me --  and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS --  which is actually addressed to me. The child in me is really excited  by these kinds of possibilities. Now I've been talking a lot about magic. And I don't mean wizards and dragons,  I mean the kind of childhood magic,  those ideas that we all harbored as children. This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason,  was always really exciting to me. And so over here you need to tilt your iPad,  take the fireflies out. And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book. Another idea that really fascinated me as a child  was that an entire galaxy could be contained  within a single marble. And so over here,  each book and each world  becomes a little marble  that I drag in  to this magical device within the device. And it opens up a map. All along, all fantasy books have always had maps,  but these maps have been static. This is a map that grows and glows  and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book. It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well. So I'm just going to enter in. Another thing that's actually really important to me  is creating content that is Indian  and yet very contemporary. Over here, these are the Apsaras. So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs,  but how many people outside of India  know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras? These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years  in an old and musty book. And so we're bringing them back  in a contemporary story for children. And a story that actually deals with new issues  like the environmental crisis. Speaking of the environmental crisis,  I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years  is that children have been locked inside their rooms,  glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out. But now with mobile technology,  we can actually take our children outside into the natural world  One of the interactions in the book  is that you're sent off on this quest  where you need to go outside,  take out your camera on the iPad  and collect pictures of different natural objects. When I was a child, I had multiple collections  of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells. And somehow kids don't do that anymore. So in bringing back this childhood ritual,  you need to go out  and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower  and then tag it. In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark  and then tag that. And what happens  is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs  that you can then put up online. A child in London puts up a picture of a fox  and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today." A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today." And it creates this kind of social network  around a collection of digital photographs  that you've actually taken. In the possibilities of linking together  magic, the earth and technology,  there are multiple possibilities. In the next book, we plan on having an interaction  where you take your iPad out with the video on  and through augmented reality,  you see this layer of animated pixies  appear on a houseplant that's outside your house. At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves. And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away  and read the rest of the book. We're moving, we're all moving here,  to a world where the forces of nature  come closer together to technology,  and magic and technology can come closer together. We're harnessing energy from the sun. We're bringing our children and ourselves  closer to the natural world  and childhood love that we had  through the simple medium of a story. Thank you. 
I would like to talk to you  about why many e-health projects fail. And I really think that the most important thing of it  is that we stopped listening to patients. And one of the things we did at Radboud University  is we appointed a chief listening officer. Not in a very scientific way --  she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea  and asks patients, family, relatives,  "What's up? How could we help you?" And we think, we like to think,  that this is one of the major problems  but most of the e-health projects fail,  since we stopped listening. This is my WiFi scale. It's a very simple thing. It's got one knob, on/off. And every morning I hop on it. And yes, I've got a challenge,  as you might see. And I put my challenge on 95 kg. But the thing is that it's made this simple  that whenever I hop on,  it sends my data through Google Health as well. And it's collected by my general practitioner as well,  so he can see what's my problem in weight,  not on the very moment  that I need cardiologic support or something like it,  but also looking backward. But there's another thing. As some of you might know, I've got more than 4,000 followers on Twitter. So every morning  I hop on my WiFi scale  and before I'm in my car, people start talking to me,  "I think you need a light lunch today, Lucien." But that's the nicest thing that could happen,  since this is peer pressure,  peer pressure used to help patients --  since this could be used for obesity,  it could be used  to stop smoking in patients. But on the other hand, it also could be used  to get people from out of their chairs  and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity  to get more control of their health. As of next week, it will soon be available. There will be this little blood pressure meter  connected to an iPhone or something or other. And people will be able, from their homes,  to take their blood pressure,  send it into their doctor  and eventually share it with others, for instance,  for over a hundred dollars. And this is the point where patients get into position  and can collect, not only their own control again,  be captain of their own ship,  but also can help us in health care  due to the challenges that we face,  like health care cost explosion,  doubled demand and things like that. Make techniques that are easy to use  and start with this to embrace patients in the team. And you can do this with techniques like this,  but also by crowd-sourcing. And one of the things we did  I would like to share with you introduced by a little video. We've all got navigation controls in our car. We maybe even [have] it in our cellphone. We know perfectly where all the ATMs are  about the city of Maastricht. The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are. And sure, we could find fast food chains. But where would be the nearest AED  to help this patient? We asked around and nobody knew. Nobody knew where the nearest life-saving AED  was to be obtained right now. So what we did, we crowdsourced The Netherlands. We set up a website  and asked the crowd, "If you see an AED,  please submit it, tell us where it is,  tell us when it's open,"  since sometimes in office hours sometimes it's closed, of course. And over 10,000 AEDs already in The Netherlands  already have been submitted. The next step we took was to find the applications for it. And we built an iPad application. We made an application for Layar, augmented reality,  to find these AEDs. And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collapses,  you can use your iPhone,  and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone,  to find the nearest AED  which can save lives. And as of today,  we would like to introduce this, not only as AED4EU,  which is what the product is called,  but also AED4US. And we would like to start this on a worldwide level. And [we're] asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world,  colleague universities, to help us  to find and work and act like a hub  to crowd-source all these AEDs all around the world. That whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses,  might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you,  you can find this. The other thing we would like to ask  is of companies also all over the world  that will be able to help us validate these AEDs. These might be courier services  or cable guys for instance,  just to see whether the AED that's submitted  still is in place. So please help us on this one  and try to make not only health a little bit better, but take control of it. Thank you. 
I'm here to share my photography. Or is it photography? Because, of course, this is a photograph  that you can't take with your camera. Yet, my interest in photography started  as I got my first digital camera  at the age of 15. It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,  but it was a bit different,  because using the camera,  the process was in the planning instead. And when you take a photograph with a camera,  the process ends when you press the trigger. So to me it felt like photography was more about  being at the right place and the right time. I felt like anyone could do that. So I wanted to create something different,  something where the process starts  when you press the trigger. Photos like this:  construction going on along a busy road. But it has an unexpected twist. And despite that,  it retains a level of realism. Or photos like these --  both dark and colorful,  but all with a common goal  of retaining the level of realism. When I say realism,  I mean photo-realism. Because, of course,  it's not something you can capture really,  but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow  as a photograph. Photos where you will need a brief moment to think  to figure out the trick. So it's more about capturing an idea  than about capturing a moment really. But what's the trick  that makes it look realistic? Is it something about the details  or the colors? Is it something about the light? What creates the illusion? Sometimes the perspective is the illusion. But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world  and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface. It's not really what is realistic,  it's what we think looks realistic really. So I think the basics  are quite simple. I just see it as a puzzle of reality  where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together  to create alternate reality. And let me show you a simple example. Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,  something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world. But combined in a certain way,  they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,  like it could exist. But at the same time, we know it can't. So we trick our brains,  because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact  that it doesn't really make sense. with combining photographs. It's just really about combining different realities. So the things that make a photograph look realistic,  I think it's the things that we don't even think about,  the things all around us in our daily lives. But when combining photographs,  this is really important to consider,  because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow. So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow  to achieve a realistic result. As you can see, these images aren't really special. But combined, they can create something like this. So the first rule is that photos combined  should have the same perspective. Secondly, photos combined  should have the same type of light. And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --  shot at the same height and in the same type of light. The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish  where the different images begin and end  by making it seamless. Make it impossible to say  how the image actually was composed. So by matching color, contrast and brightness  in the borders between the different images,  adding photographic defects  like depth of field,  desaturated colors and noise,  we erase the borders between the different images  and make it look like one single image,  despite the fact that one image  can contain hundreds of layers basically. So here's another example. One might think that this is just an image of a landscape  and the lower part is what's manipulated. But this image is actually entirely composed  of photographs from different locations. I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place  than to find a place,  because then you don't need to compromise  with the ideas in your head. But it does require a lot of planning. And getting this idea during winter,  I knew that I had several months to plan it,  to find the different locations  for the pieces of the puzzle basically. So for example,  the fish was captured on a fishing trip. The shores are from a different location. The underwater part was captured in a stone pit. And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red  to make it look more Swedish. So to achieve a realistic result,  I think it comes down to planning. It always starts with a sketch, an idea. Then it's about combining the different photographs. And here every piece is very well planned. And if you do a good job capturing the photos,  the result can be quite beautiful  and also quite realistic. So all the tools are out there,  and the only thing that limits us  is our imagination. Thank you. 
Because I usually take the role  of trying to explain to people  how wonderful the new technologies  that are coming along are going to be,  and I thought that, since I was among friends here,  I would tell you what I really think  and try to look back and try to understand  what is really going on here  with these amazing jumps in technology  that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it. So I'm going to start out  by showing just one very boring technology slide. And then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on. This is just a random slide  that I picked out of my file. What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide,  but the general form of it. This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing  about the power of RISC microprocessors  versus the power of local area networks. And the interesting thing about it  is that this slide,  like so many technology slides that we're used to,  is a sort of a straight line  on a semi-log curve. In other words, every step here  represents an order of magnitude  in performance scale. And this is a new thing  that we talk about technology  on semi-log curves. Something really weird is going on here. And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about. So, if you could bring up the lights. If you could bring up the lights higher,  because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here. Now why do we draw technology curves  in semi-log curves? Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve  where, let's say, this is years,  this is time of some sort,  and this is whatever measure of the technology  that I'm trying to graph,  the graphs look sort of silly. They sort of go like this. And they don't tell us much. Now if I graph, for instance,  some other technology, say transportation technology,  on a semi-log curve,  it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line. But when something like this happens,  things are qualitatively changing. So if transportation technology  was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,  then the day after tomorrow,  I would be able to get in a taxi cab  and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds. It's not moving like that. And there's nothing precedented  in the history of technology development  of this kind of self-feeding growth  where you go by orders of magnitude every few years. Now the question that I'd like to ask is,  if you look at these exponential curves,  they don't go on forever. Things just can't possibly keep changing  as fast as they are. One of two things is going to happen. Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this,  until something totally different comes along,  or maybe it's going to do this. That's about all it can do. Now I'm an optimist,  so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that. If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now  is a transition. We're sort of on this line  in a transition from the way the world used to be  to some new way that the world is. And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself,  is what's this new way that the world is? What's that new state that the world is heading toward? Because the transition seems very, very confusing  when we're right in the middle of it. Now when I was a kid growing up,  the future was kind of the year 2000,  and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000. Now here's a conference  in which people talk about the future,  and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000. It's about as far as we go out. So in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking  one year per year  for my whole lifetime. Now I think that the reason  is because we all feel  that something's happening there. That transition is happening. We can all sense it. And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense  to think out 30, 50 years  because everything's going to be so different  that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing  just doesn't make any sense at all. So what I would like to talk about  is what that could be,  what that transition could be that we're going through. Now in order to do that  I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff  that really has nothing to do  with technology and computers. Because I think the only way to understand this  is to really step back  and take a long time scale look at things. So the time scale that I would like to look at this on  is the time scale of life on Earth. So I think this picture makes sense  if you look at it a few billion years at a time. So if you go back  about two and a half billion years,  the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock  with a lot of chemicals floating around on it. And if you look at the way  that the chemicals got organized,  we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it. And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand  about how it started with RNA,  but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,  which is that, at that time,  there were little drops of oil floating around  with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them. And some of those drops of oil  had a particular combination of chemicals in them  which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside  and grow the drops of oil. And those that were like that  started to split and divide. And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense,  those little drops of oil. But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now,  because every one of them  was a little random recipe of chemicals. And every time it divided,  they got sort of unequal division  of the chemicals within them. And so every drop was a little bit different. In fact, the drops that were different in a way  that caused them to be better  at incorporating chemicals around them,  grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more. So those tended to live longer,  get expressed more. Now that's sort of just a very simple  chemical form of life,  but when things got interesting  was when these drops  learned a trick about abstraction. Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand,  these little drops learned to write down information. They learned to record the information  that was the recipe of the cell  onto a particular kind of chemical  called DNA. So in other words, they worked out,  in this mindless sort of evolutionary way,  a form of writing that let them write down what they were,  so that that way of writing it down could get copied. The amazing thing is that that way of writing  seems to have stayed steady  since it evolved two and a half billion years ago. In fact the recipe for us, our genes,  is exactly that same code and that same way of writing. In fact, every living creature is written  in exactly the same set of letters and the same code. In fact, one of the things that I did  just for amusement purposes  is we can now write things in this code. And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder,  which I try not to let the security people see at airports. But this has in it --  what I did is I took this code --  the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it --  and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA  and amplified it 10 to the 22 times. So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card,  I have plenty for everyone in the room,  and, in fact, everyone in the world,  and it's right here. If I had really been a egotist,  I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room. So what was the next step? Writing down the DNA was an interesting step. And that caused these cells --  that kept them happy for another billion years. But then there was another really interesting step  where things became completely different,  which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information,  so that they began to get communities of cells. I don't know if you know this,  but bacteria can actually exchange DNA. Now that's why, for instance,  antibiotic resistance has evolved. Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin,  and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information  with other bacteria,  and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin,  because bacteria communicate. Now what this communication allowed  was communities to form  that, in some sense, were in the same boat together;  they were synergistic. So they survived  or they failed together,  which means that if a community was very successful,  all the individuals in that community  were repeated more  and they were favored by evolution. Now the transition point happened  when these communities got so close  that, in fact, they got together  and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community  together on one string of DNA. And so the next stage that's interesting in life  took about another billion years. And at that stage,  we have multi-cellular communities,  communities of lots of different types of cells,  working together as a single organism. And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community. We have lots of cells  that are not out for themselves anymore. Your skin cell is really useless  without a heart cell, muscle cell,  a brain cell and so on. So these communities began to evolve  so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place  was no longer a cell,  but a community which we call an organism. Now the next step that happened  is within these communities. These communities of cells,  again, began to abstract information. And they began building very special structures  that did nothing but process information within the community. And those are the neural structures. So neurons are the information processing apparatus  that those communities of cells built up. And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community  and special structures  that were responsible for recording,  understanding, learning information. And that was the brains and the nervous system  And that gave them an evolutionary advantage. Because at that point,  an individual --  learning could happen  within the time span of a single organism,  instead of over this evolutionary time span. So an organism could, for instance,  learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit  because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it. That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism,  whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,  that would have had to be learned evolutionarily  over hundreds of thousands of years  by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit. So that nervous system,  the fact that they built these special information structures,  tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution. Because evolution could now happen within an individual. It could happen in learning time scales. But then what happened  was the individuals worked out,  of course, tricks of communicating. And for example,  the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language. It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it. Here I have a very complicated, messy,  confused idea in my head. I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,  and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head  that bears some analogy to it. But we're taking something very complicated,  turning it into sound, sequences of sounds,  and producing something very complicated in your brain. So this allows us now  to begin to start functioning  as a single organism. And so, in fact, what we've done  is we, humanity,  have started abstracting out. We're going through the same levels  that multi-cellular organisms have gone through --  abstracting out our methods of recording,  presenting, processing information. So for example, the invention of language  was a tiny step in that direction. Telephony, computers,  videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on  are all our specialized mechanisms  that we've now built within our society  for handling that information. And it all connects us together  into something  that is much bigger  and much faster  and able to evolve  So now, evolution can take place  on a scale of microseconds. And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example  where he sort of did a little bit of evolution  on the Convolution program right before your eyes. So now we've speeded up the time scales once again. So the first steps of the story that I told you about  took a billion years a piece. And the next steps,  like nervous systems and brains,  took a few hundred million years. Then the next steps, like language and so on,  took less than a million years. And these next steps, like electronics,  seem to be taking only a few decades. The process is feeding on itself  and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it --  when something reinforces its rate of change. The more it changes, the faster it changes. And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve. We're seeing this process feeding back on itself. Now I design computers for a living,  and I know that the mechanisms  that I use to design computers  would be impossible  without recent advances in computers. So right now, what I do  is I design objects at such complexity  that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense. I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does. There are billions of them. Instead, what I do  and what the designers at Thinking Machines do  is we think at some level of abstraction  and then we hand it to the machine  and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,  much farther and faster than we could ever do. And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods  that we don't quite even understand. One method that's particularly interesting  that I've been using a lot lately  is evolution itself. So what we do  is we put inside the machine  a process of evolution  that takes place on the microsecond time scale. So for example,  in the most extreme cases,  we can actually evolve a program  by starting out with random sequences of instructions. Say, "Computer, would you please make  a hundred million random sequences of instructions. Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,  run all of those programs,  and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted." So in other words, I define what I wanted. Let's say I want to sort numbers,  as a simple example I've done it with. So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers. So of course, random sequences of instructions  are very unlikely to sort numbers,  so none of them will really do it. But one of them, by luck,  may put two numbers in the right order. And I say, "Computer,  would you please now take the 10 percent  of those random sequences that did the best job. Save those. Kill off the rest. And now let's reproduce  the ones that sorted numbers the best. And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination  analogous to sex." Take two programs and they produce children  by exchanging their subroutines,  and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs. So I've got now a new generation of programs  that are produced by combinations  of the programs that did a little bit better job. Say, "Please repeat that process." Score them again. Introduce some mutations perhaps. And try that again and do that for another generation. Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds. So I can do the equivalent  of millions of years of evolution on that  or in the complicated cases, in a few hours. At the end of that, I end up with programs  that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers. In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient  than programs I could have ever written by hand. Now if I look at those programs,  I can't tell you how they work. I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work. They're obscure, weird programs. But they do the job. And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job  because they come from a line  of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job. In fact, their life depended on doing the job. I was riding in a 747  with Marvin Minsky once,  and he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this. It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts  working together to make you a safe flight.'  Doesn't that make you feel confident?" In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well  when it gets complicated. So we're beginning to depend on computers  to do a process that's very different than engineering. And it lets us produce things of much more complexity  than normal engineering lets us produce. And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it. So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us. We're now using those programs  to make much faster computers  so that we'll be able to run this process much faster. So it's feeding back on itself. The thing is becoming faster  and that's why I think it seems so confusing. Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves. We're taking off. And what we are is we're at a point in time  which is analogous to when single-celled organisms  were turning into multi-celled organisms. So we're the amoebas  and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating. We're right at that point of transition. But I think that there really is something coming along after us. I think it's very haughty of us  to think that we're the end product of evolution. And I think all of us here  are a part of producing  whatever that next thing is. So lunch is coming along,  and I think I will stop at that point,  before I get selected out. 
I think we have to do something  about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change. And I think it starts with one physician, and that's me. And maybe I've been around long enough  that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige  to be able to do that. Before I actually begin the meat of my talk,  let's begin with a bit of baseball. Hey, why not? We're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series. We all love baseball, don't we? Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics. And there's hundreds of them. "Moneyball" is about to come out, and it's all about statistics  and using statistics to build a great baseball team. I'm going to focus on one stat  that I hope a lot of you have heard of. It's called batting average. So we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300. That means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely  three times out of 10 at bats. That means hit the ball into the outfield,  it dropped, it didn't get caught,  and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time  and the runner was safe. Three times out of 10. Do you know what they call a 300 hitter  in Major League Baseball? Good, really good,  maybe an all-star. Do you know what they call  a 400 baseball hitter? That's somebody who hit, by the way,  four times safely out of every 10. Legendary --  as in Ted Williams legendary --  the last Major League Baseball player  to hit over 400 during a regular season. Now let's take this back into my world of medicine  where I'm a lot more comfortable,  or perhaps a bit less comfortable  after what I'm going to talk to you about. Suppose you have appendicitis  and you're referred to a surgeon  who's batting 400 on appendectomies. Somehow this isn't working out, is it? Now suppose you live  in a certain part of a certain remote place  and you have a loved one  who has blockages in two coronary arteries  and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist  who's batting 200 on angioplasties. But, but, you know what? She's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail. And she's hitting a 257. Somehow this isn't working. But I'm going to ask you a question. What do you think a batting average  for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner  or an orthopedic surgeon,  an OBGYN, a paramedic  is supposed to be? 1,000, very good. Now truth of the matter is,  nobody knows in all of medicine  what a good surgeon  or physician or paramedic  is supposed to bat. What we do though is we send each one of them, including myself,  out into the world  with the admonition, be perfect. Never ever, ever make a mistake,  but you worry about the details, about how that's going to happen. And that was the message that I absorbed  when I was in med school. I was an obsessive compulsive student. In high school, a classmate once said  that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test. And so I did. And I studied in my little garret  at the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital,  not far from here. And I memorized everything. I memorized in my anatomy class  the origins and exertions of every muscle,  every branch of every artery that came off the aorta,  differential diagnoses obscure and common. I even knew the differential diagnosis  in how to classify renal tubular acidosis. And all the while,  I was amassing more and more knowledge. And I did well, I graduated with honors,  And I came out of medical school  with the impression  that if I memorized everything and knew everything,  or as much as possible,  as close to everything as possible,  that it would immunize me against making mistakes. for a while,  until I met Mrs. Drucker. I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto  when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department  of the hospital where I was working. At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service  on a cardiology rotation. And it was my job,  when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult,  to see that patient in emerg. and to report back to my attending. And I saw Mrs. Drucker, and she was breathless. And when I listened to her, she was making a wheezy sound. And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope,  I could hear crackly sounds on both sides  that told me that she was in congestive heart failure. This is a condition in which the heart fails,  and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward,  some of the blood backs up into the lung, the lungs fill up with blood,  and that's why you have shortness of breath. And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make. I made it and I set to work treating her. I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart. I gave her medications that we call diuretics, water pills,  to get her to pee out the access fluid. And over the course of the next hour and a half or two,  she started to feel better. And I felt really good. And that's when I made my first mistake;  I sent her home. Actually, I made two more mistakes. I sent her home  without speaking to my attending. I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do,  which was call my attending and run the story by him  so he would have a chance to see her for himself. And he knew her,  he would have been able to furnish additional information about her. Maybe I did it for a good reason. Maybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident. Maybe I wanted to be so successful  and so able to take responsibility  that I would do so  and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients  without even having to contact him. The second mistake that I made was worse. In sending her home,  I disregarded a little voice deep down inside  that was trying to tell me,  "Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this." In fact, so lacking in confidence was I  that I actually asked the nurse  who was looking after Mrs. Drucker,  "Do you think it's okay if she goes home?" And the nurse thought about it  and said very matter-of-factly, "Yeah, I think she'll do okay." I can remember that like it was yesterday. So I signed the discharge papers,  and an ambulance came, paramedics came to take her home. And I went back to my work on the wards. All the rest of that day,  that afternoon,  I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach. But I carried on with my work. And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital  and walked to the parking lot  to take my car and drive home  when I did something that I don't usually do. I walked through the emergency department on my way home. And it was there that another nurse,  not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse,  said three words to me  that are the three words  that most emergency physicians I know dread. Others in medicine dread them as well,  but there's something particular about emergency medicine  because we see patients so fleetingly. The three words are:  Do you remember? "Do you remember that patient you sent home?" the other nurse asked matter-of-factly. "Well she's back,"  in just that tone of voice. Well she was back all right. She was back and near death. About an hour after she had arrived home,  after I'd sent her home,  she collapsed and her family called 911  and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department  where she had a blood pressure of 50,  which is in severe shock. And she was barely breathing and she was blue. And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops. They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure. They put her on a ventilator. And I was shocked  and shaken to the core. And I went through this roller coaster,  because after they stabilized her,  she went to the intensive care unit,  and I hoped against hope that she would recover. And over the next two or three days,  it was clear that she was never going to wake up. She had irreversible brain damage. And the family gathered. And over the course of the next eight or nine days,  they resigned themselves to what was happening. And at about the nine day mark, they let her go --  Mrs. Drucker,  a wife, a mother  and a grandmother. They say you never forget the names  of those who die. And that was my first time to be acquainted with that. Over the next few weeks,  I beat myself up  and I experienced for the first time  the unhealthy shame that exists  in our culture of medicine --  where I felt alone, isolated,  not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel,  because you can't talk about it with your colleagues. You know that healthy kind,  when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal  and then you get busted  and then your best friend confronts you  and you have terrible discussions,  but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you  and you say, I'll never make that mistake again. And you make amends and you never make that mistake again. That's the kind of shame that is a teacher. The unhealthy shame I'm talking about  is the one that makes you so sick inside. It's the one that says,  not that what you did was bad,  but that you are bad. And it was what I was feeling. And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll. He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over  and made sure that I didn't get sued. And I kept asking myself these questions. Why didn't I ask my attending? Why did I send her home? And then at my worst moments:  Why did I make such a stupid mistake? Why did I go into medicine? Slowly but surely,  it lifted. I began to feel a bit better. And on a cloudy day,  there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out  and I wondered,  maybe I could feel better again. And I made myself a bargain  that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect  and never make another mistake again,  please make the voices stop. And they did. And I went back to work. And then it happened again. Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department  at a community hospital just north of Toronto,  and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat. It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry. He kept pointing here. I looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink. And I gave him a prescription for penicillin  and sent him on his way. And even as he was walking out the door,  he was still sort of pointing to his throat. And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift,  and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office. And she said the three words:  Do you remember? "Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?" Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat. He had a potentially life-threatening condition  called epiglottitis. You can Google it,  but it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway,  and it can actually cause the airway to close. And fortunately he didn't die. He was placed on intravenous antibiotics  and he recovered after a few days. And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations  and felt cleansed and went back to work,  until it happened again and again and again. Twice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis. Now that takes some doing,  especially when you work in a hospital  that at the time saw but 14 people a night. Now in both cases, I didn't send them home  and I don't think there was any gap in their care. One I thought had a kidney stone. I ordered a kidney X-ray. When it turned out to be normal,  my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient  noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons. The other one had a lot of diarrhea. I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him  and asked my colleague to reassess him. And he did  and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons. In both cases,  they had their operations and they did okay. But each time,  they were gnawing at me, eating at me. And I'd like to be able to say to you  that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice  as many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S. Some of my doozies have been in the last five years. Alone, ashamed and unsupported. Here's the problem:  If I can't come clean  and talk about my mistakes,  if I can't find the still-small voice  that tells me what really happened,  how can I share it with my colleagues? How can I teach them about what I did  so that they don't do the same thing? If I were to walk into a room --  like right now, I have no idea what you think of me. When was the last time you heard somebody talk  about failure after failure after failure? Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party  and you might hear about some other doctor,  but you're not going to hear somebody  talking about their own mistakes. If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages  and ask for their support right now  and start to tell what I've just told you right now,  I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories  before they would start to get really uncomfortable,  somebody would crack a joke,  they'd change the subject and we would move on. And in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew  that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital,  believe me, I'd have trouble  making eye contact with that person. That's the system that we have. It's a complete denial of mistakes. It's a system  in which there are two kinds of physicians --  those who make mistakes  and those who don't,  those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can,  those who have lousy outcomes  and those who have great outcomes. And it's almost like an ideological reaction,  like the antibodies begin to attack that person. And we have this idea  that if we drive the people who make mistakes  out of medicine,  what will we be left with, but a safe system. But there are two problems with that. In my 20 years or so  of medical broadcasting and journalism,  I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors  to learn everything I can,  from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star  to my show "White Coat, Black Art." And what I've learned  is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous. We work in a system  where errors happen every day,  where one in 10 medications  are either the wrong medication given in hospital  or at the wrong dosage,  where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous,  causing havoc and death. In this country,  as many as 24,000 Canadians die  of preventable medical errors. In the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000. In both cases, these are gross underestimates,  because we really aren't ferreting out the problem  as we should. And here's the thing. In a hospital system  where medical knowledge is doubling  every two or three years, we can't keep up with it. Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive. We can't get rid of it. We have our cognitive biases,  so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain. Now take the same patient with chest pain,  make them moist and garrulous  and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath,  and suddenly my history is laced with contempt. I don't take the same history. I'm not a robot;  I don't do things the same way each time. And my patients aren't cars;  they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time. Given all of that, mistakes are inevitable. So if you take the system, as I was taught,  and weed out all the error-prone health professionals,  well there won't be anybody left. And you know that business  about people not wanting  to talk about their worst cases? On my show, on "White Coat, Black Art,"  I made it a habit of saying, "Here's my worst mistake,"  I would say to everybody  from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery,  "Here's my worst mistake," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  "What about yours?" and I would point the microphone towards them. And their pupils would dilate,  they would recoil,  then they would look down and swallow hard  and start to tell me their stories. They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories. They want to be able to say,  "Look, don't make the same mistake I did." What they need is an environment to be able to do that. What they need is a redefined medical culture. And it starts with one physician at a time. The redefined physician is human,  knows she's human,  accepts it, isn't proud of making mistakes,  but strives to learn one thing  from what happened  that she can teach to somebody else. She shares her experience with others. She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes. And she points out other people's mistakes,  not in a gotcha way,  but in a loving, supportive way  so that everybody can benefit. And she works in a culture of medicine  that acknowledges  that human beings run the system,  and when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time. So the system is evolving  to create backups  that make it easier to detect those mistakes  that humans inevitably make  and also fosters in a loving, supportive way  places where everybody who is observing  in the health care system  can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes  and is rewarded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mistakes,  we're rewarded for coming clean. My name is Brian Goldman. I am a redefined physician. I'm human. I make mistakes. I'm sorry about that,  but I strive to learn one thing  that I can pass on to other people. I still don't know what you think of me,  but I can live with that. And let me close with three words of my own:  I do remember. 
Do you know how many choices you make  in a typical day? Do you know how many choices you make  in typical week? I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans,  and the average number of choices  that the typical American reports making  is about 70 in a typical day. There was also recently a study done with CEOs  in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week. And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks  that these CEOs engaged in  and how much time they spent engaging  in making decisions related to these tasks. And they found that the average CEO  engaged in about 139 tasks in a week. Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course. 50 percent of their decisions  were made in nine minutes or less. Only about 12 percent of the decisions  did they make an hour or more of their time. Think about your own choices. Do you know how many choices  make it into your nine minute category  versus your one hour category? How well do you think you're doing  at managing those choices? Today I want to talk  about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,  which is the choice overload problem. I want to talk about the problem  and some potential solutions. Now as I talk about this problem,  I'm going to have some questions for you  and I'm going to want to know your answers. So when I ask you a question,  since I'm blind,  only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories. Otherwise, when I ask you a question,  and if your answer is yes,  I'd like you to clap your hands. So for my first question for you today:  Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem? Thank you. So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,  I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;  at least at that time it was truly upscale. It was a store called Draeger's. Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park. They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars  and over 500 different kinds  of fruits and vegetables  and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --  and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water. I used to love going to this store,  but on one occasion I asked myself,  well how come you never buy anything? Here's their olive oil aisle. They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,  including those that were in a locked case  that came from thousand-year-old olive trees. So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,  and I asked the manager,  "Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?" And he pointed to the busloads of tourists  that would show up everyday,  with cameras ready usually. We decided to do a little experiment,  and we picked jam for our experiment. Here's their jam aisle. They had 348 different kinds of jam. We set up a little tasting booth  right near the entrance of the store. We there put out six different flavors of jam  or 24 different flavors of jam,  and we looked at two things:  First, in which case  were people more likely to stop, sample some jam? More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,  than when there were six,  about 40 percent. The next thing we looked at  is in which case were people more likely  to buy a jar of jam. Now we see the opposite effect. Of the people who stopped when there were 24,  only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. Of the people who stopped when there were six,  well now we saw that 30 percent of them  actually bought a jar of jam. Now if you do the math,  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam  Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam  is probably good for us --  at least it's good for our waistlines --  but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us  even in very consequential decisions. We choose not to choose,  even when it goes against our best self-interests. So now for the topic of today: financial savings. Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang  where we looked at the retirement savings decisions  of nearly a million Americans  from about 650 plans  all in the U.S. And what we looked at  was whether the number of fund offerings  available in a retirement savings plan,  the 401 plan,  does that affect people's likelihood  to save more for tomorrow. And what we found  was that indeed there was a correlation. So in these plans, we had about 657 plans  that ranged from offering people  anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings. And what we found was that,  the more funds offered,  indeed, there was less participation rate. So if you look at the extremes,  those plans that offered you two funds,  participation rates were around in the mid-70s --  still not as high as we want it to be. In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,  participation rates have now dropped  to about the 60th percentile. Now it turns out  that even if you do choose to participate  when there are more choices present,  even then, it has negative consequences. So for those people who did choose to participate,  the more choices available,  the more likely people were  to completely avoid stocks or equity funds. The more choices available,  the more likely they were  to put all their money in pure money market accounts. Now neither of these extreme decisions  are the kinds of decisions  that any of us would recommend for people  when you're considering their future financial well-being. Well, over the past decade,  we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices. They're more likely to delay choosing --  procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest. They're more likely to make worse choices --  worse financial choices, medical choices. They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,  even when they do objectively better. The main reason for this  is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls  of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,  but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting  and actually picking from that stunning display. So what I want to propose to you today  are four simple techniques --  techniques that we have tested in one way or another  in different research venues --  that you can easily apply  in your businesses. The first: Cut. You've heard it said before,  but it's never been more true than today,  that less is more. People are always upset when I say, "Cut." They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space. But in fact, what we're seeing more and more  is that if you are willing to cut,  get rid of those extraneous redundant options,  well there's an increase in sales,  there's a lowering of costs,  there is an improvement of the choosing experience. When Proctor &amp; Gamble  went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15,  they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent. When the Golden Cat Corporation  got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,  they saw an increase in profits  by 87 percent --  a function of both increase in sales  and lowering of costs. You know, the average grocery store today  offers you 45,000 products. The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products. But the ninth largest retailer,  the ninth biggest retailer in the world today  is Aldi,  and it offers you only 1,400 products --  one kind of canned tomato sauce. Now in the financial savings world,  I think one of the best examples that has recently come out  on how to best manage the choice offerings  has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,  which was the program that they have at Harvard. Every single Harvard employee  is now automatically enrolled  in a lifecycle fund. For those people who actually want to choose,  they're given 20 funds,  not 300 or more funds. You know, often, people say,  "I don't know how to cut. They're all important choices." And the first thing I do is I ask the employees,  "Tell me how these choices are different from one another. And if your employees can't tell them apart,  neither can your consumers." Now before we started our session this afternoon,  I had a chat with Gary. And Gary said that he would be willing  to offer people in this audience  an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world. Here's a description of the road. And I'd like you to read it. And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it  if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer. Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer. Is that all? All right, let me show you some more about this. You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you. Now who's ready to go on this trip. I think I might have actually heard more hands. All right. Now in fact,  you had objectively more information  the first time around than the second time around,  but I would venture to guess  that you felt that it was more real the second time around. Because the pictures made it feel  more real to you. Which brings me to the second technique  for handling the choice overload problem,  which is concretization. That in order for people to understand  the differences between the choices,  they have to be able to understand  the consequences associated with each choice,  and that the consequences need to be felt  in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way. Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more  when they use an ATM card or a credit card  as opposed to cash? Because it doesn't feel like real money. And it turns out  that making it feel more concrete  can actually be a very positive tool  to use in getting people to save more. So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi  and Alessandro Previtero,  we did a study with people at ING --  employees that are all working at ING --  and now these people were all in a session  where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan. And during that session,  we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,  but we added one little thing. The one little thing we added  was we asked people  to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life  By doing that simple thing,  there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent  and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save  or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account  by four percent. The third technique: Categorization. We can handle more categories  than we can handle choices. So for example,  here's a study we did in a magazine aisle. It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores  up and down the northeast corridor,  the magazine aisles range anywhere  from 331 different kinds of magazines  all the way up to 664. But you know what? If I show you 600 magazines  and I divide them up into 10 categories,  versus I show you 400 magazines  and divide them up into 20 categories,  you believe that I have given you  more choice and a better choosing experience  if I gave you the 400  than if I gave you the 600. Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart. Here are two different jewelry displays. One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing." If you think the display on the left is Swing  and the display on the right is Jazz,  clap your hands. Okay, there's some. If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  clap your hands. Okay, a bit more. Now it turns out you're right. The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  but you know what? This is a highly useless categorization scheme. The categories need to say something  to the chooser, not the choice-maker. And you often see that problem  when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds. Who are they actually supposed to be informing? My fourth technique: Condition for complexity. It turns out we can actually  handle a lot more information than we think we can,  we've just got to take it a little easier. We have to gradually increase the complexity. I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about. Let's take a very, very complicated decision:  buying a car. Here's a German car manufacturer  that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car. You've got to make 60 different decisions,  completely make up your car. Now these decisions vary  in the number of choices that they offer per decision. Car colors, exterior car colors --  I've got 56 choices. Engines, gearshift -- four choices. So now what I'm going to do  is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear. So half of the customers  are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,  to low choice, four gearshifts. The other half of the customers  are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,  to 56 car colors, high choice. What am I going to look at? How engaged you are. If you keep hitting the default button per decision,  that means you're getting overwhelmed,  that means I'm losing you. What you find  is the people who go from high choice to low choice,  they're hitting that default button over and over and over again. We're losing them. They go from low choice to high choice,  they're hanging in there. It's the same information. It's the same number of choices. The only thing that I have done  is I have varied the order  in which that information is presented. If I start you off easy,  I learn how to choose. Even though choosing gearshift  doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,  it still prepares me for how to choose. It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,  so I'm more willing to be motivated  to be engaged. So let me recap. I have talked about four techniques  for mitigating the problem of choice overload --  cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives;  concretize -- make it real;  categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices;  condition for complexity. All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today  are designed to help you manage your choices --  better for you, you can use them on yourself,  better for the people that you are serving. Because I believe that the key  to getting the most from choice  is to be choosy about choosing. And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing  the better we will be able  to practice the art of choosing. Thank you very much. 
In the 1980s  in the communist Eastern Germany,  if you owned a typewriter,  you had to register it with the government. You had to register  a sample sheet of text  out of the typewriter. And this was done  so the government could track where text was coming from. If they found a paper  which had the wrong kind of thought,  they could track down  who created that thought. And we in the West  couldn't understand how anybody could do this,  how much this would restrict freedom of speech. We would never do that  in our own countries. But today in 2011,  if you go and buy a color laser printer  from any major laser printer manufacturer  and print a page,  that page will end up  having slight yellow dots  printed on every single page  in a pattern which makes the page unique  to you and to your printer. This is happening  to us today. And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it. And this is an example  of the ways  that our own governments  are using technology  against us, the citizens. And this is one of the main three sources  of online problems today. If we take a look at what's really happening in the online world,  we can group the attacks based on the attackers. We have three main groups. We have online criminals. Like here, we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov  from the city of Kiev in Ukraine. And the motives of online criminals  are very easy to understand. These guys make money. They use online attacks  to make lots of money,  and lots and lots of it. We actually have several cases  of millionaires online, multimillionaires,  who made money with their attacks. Here's Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia. This is Alfred Gonzalez. This is Stephen Watt. This is Bjorn Sundin. This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour  and so on and so on. These guys  make their fortunes online,  but they make it through the illegal means  of using things like banking trojans  to steal money from our bank accounts  while we do online banking,  or with keyloggers  to collect our credit card information  while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer. The U.S. Secret Service,  two months ago,  froze the Swiss bank account  of Mr. Sam Jain right here,  and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it  Mr. Jain himself is on the loose;  nobody knows where he is. And I claim it's already today  that it's more likely for any of us  to become the victim of a crime online  than here in the real world. And it's very obvious  that this is only going to get worse. In the future, the majority of crime  will be happening online. The second major group of attackers  that we are watching today  are not motivated by money. They're motivated by something else --  motivated by protests,  motivated by an opinion,  motivated by the laughs. Groups like Anonymous  have risen up over the last 12 months  and have become a major player  in the field of online attacks. So those are the three main attackers:  criminals who do it for the money,  hacktivists like Anonymous  doing it for the protest,  but then the last group are nation states,  governments doing the attacks. And then we look at cases  like what happened in DigiNotar. This is a prime example of what happens  when governments attack  against their own citizens. DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority  from The Netherlands --  or actually, it was. It was running into bankruptcy  last fall  because they were hacked into. Somebody broke in  and they hacked it thoroughly. And I asked last week  in a meeting with Dutch government representatives,  I asked one of the leaders of the team  whether he found plausible  that people died  because of the DigiNotar hack. And his answer was yes. So how do people die  as the result of a hack like this? Well DigiNotar is a C.A. They sell certificates. What do you do with certificates? Well you need a certificate  if you have a website that has https,  SSL encrypted services,  services like Gmail. Now we all, or a big part of us,  use Gmail or one of their competitors,  but these services are especially popular  in totalitarian states  like Iran,  where dissidents  use foreign services like Gmail  because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services  and they are encrypted over SSL connections,  so the local government can't snoop  on their discussions. Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A. and issue rogue certificates. And this is exactly what happened  with the case of DigiNotar. What about Arab Spring  and things that have been happening, for example, in Egypt? Well in Egypt,  the rioters looted the headquarters  of the Egyptian secret police  in April 2011,  and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers. Among those papers,  was this binder entitled "FINFISHER." And within that binder were notes  from a company based in Germany  which had sold the Egyptian government  a set of tools  for intercepting --  and in very large scale --  all the communication of the citizens of the country. They had sold this tool  for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government. The company headquarters are right here. So Western governments  are providing totalitarian governments with tools  to do this against their own citizens. But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well. For example, in Germany,  just a couple of weeks ago  the so-called State Trojan was found,  which was a trojan  used by German government officials  to investigate their own citizens. If you are a suspect in a criminal case,  well it's pretty obvious, your phone will be tapped. But today, it goes beyond that. They will tap your Internet connection. They will even use tools like State Trojan  to infect your computer with a trojan,  which enables them  to watch all your communication,  to listen to your online discussions,  to collect your passwords. Now when we think deeper  about things like these,  the obvious response from people should be  that, "Okay, that sounds bad,  but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen. Why should I worry? Because I have nothing to hide." And this is an argument,  which doesn't make sense. Privacy is implied. Privacy is not up for discussion. This is not a question  between privacy  against security. It's a question of freedom  against control. And while we might trust our governments  any right we give away will be given away for good. And do we trust, do we blindly trust,  any future government,  a government we might have  50 years from now? And these are the questions  that we have to worry about for the next 50 years. 
This is where I live. I live in Kenya,  at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park. Those are my dad's cows at the back,  and behind the cows,  that's the Nairobi National Park. Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely,  which means wild animals like zebras  migrate out of the park freely. So predators like lions follow them,  and this is what they do. They kill our livestock. This is one of the cows which was killed at night,  and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead,  and I felt so bad,  because it was the only bull we had. My community, the Maasai, we believe that  we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land  for herding them, and that's why we value them so much. So I grew up hating lions so much. The morans are the warriors  who protect our community and the livestock,  and they're also upset about this problem. So they kill the lions. It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi. And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few. So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community  is responsible for his dad's cows,  and that's the same thing which happened to me. So I had to find a way of solving this problem. And the first idea I got was to use fire,  because I thought lions were scared of fire. But I came to realize that that didn't really help,  because it was even helping the lions  to see through the cowshed. So I didn't give up. I continued. And a second idea I got was  to use a scarecrow. I was trying to trick the lions  [into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed. But lions are very clever.   They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back,  but the second day, they'll come and they say,  this thing is not moving here, it's always here.   So he jumps in and kills the animals. So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch,  and that day, the lions didn't come. And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light. So I had an idea. Since I was a small boy,  I used to work in my room for the whole day,  and I even took apart my mom's new radio,  and that day she almost killed me,  but I learned a lot about electronics.   So I got an old car battery,  an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle,  and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks. And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off. And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight. So I set up everything. As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery,  and the battery supplies the power  to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer. And the indicator box makes the lights flash. As you can see, the bulbs face outside,  because that's where the lions come from. And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night. The lights flash and trick  the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed,  but I was sleeping in my bed. Thanks. So I set it up in my home two years ago,  and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions. And my neighboring homes heard about this idea. One of them was this grandmother. She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions,  and she asked me if I could put the lights for her. And I said, "Yes." So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights. Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community,  and they're really working. And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya  for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards,  and it's also being used  to scare elephants away from people's farms. Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship  in one of the best schools in Kenya,  Brookhouse International School,  and I'm really excited about this. My new school now is coming in and helping  by fundraising and creating an awareness. I even took my friends back to my community,  and we're installing the lights to the homes  which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them. So one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland  herding my father's cows,  and I used to see planes flying over,  and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside. And here I am today. I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED. So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up. I used to hate lions, but now because my invention  is saving my father's cows and the lions,  we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict. Ashê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much. Chris Anderson: You have no idea how exciting it is  to hear a story like yours. So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep. CA: You're working on other electrical inventions. What's the next one on your list? RT: My next invention is,  I want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence? RT: But I know electric fences are already invented,  but I want to make mine. CA: You already tried it once, right, and you --RT: I tried it before,  but I stopped because it gave me a shock.   CA: In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else. We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend. Thank you so much.RT: Thank you. 
When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet. And I grew up singing a song called "Nothing To Envy." And I was very proud. In school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung,  but we never learned much about the outside world,  except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies. Although I often wondered about the outside world,  I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea,  until everything suddenly changed. When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution. But I thought my life in North Korea was normal. My family was not poor,  and myself, I had never experienced hunger. But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter  from a coworker's sister. It read, "When you read this,  our five family members will not exist in this world,  because we haven't eaten for the past three weeks. We are lying on the floor together,  and our bodies are so weak, we are waiting to die." I was so shocked. This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering. Soon after, when I was walking past a train station,  I saw something terrible that to this day I can't erase from my memory. A lifeless woman was lying on the ground,  while an emaciated child in her arms  just stared helplessly at his mother's face. But nobody helped them,  because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families. A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s. Ultimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine,  and many only survived by eating grass, bugs and tree bark. Power outages also became more and more frequent,  so everything around me was completely dark at night,  except for the sea of lights in China,  just across the river from my home. I always wondered why they had lights, but we didn't. This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night,  compared to neighbors. This is the Amnok River,  which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China. As you can see, the river can be very narrow at certain points,  allowing North Koreans to secretly cross. But many die. Sometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river. I can't reveal many details about how I left North Korea,  but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine,  I was sent to China to live with distant relatives. But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time. I could have never imagined  that it would take 14 years to live together. In China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family. I had no idea what life was going to be like  as a North Korean refugee. But I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult,  it's also very dangerous,  since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants. So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed,  and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate,  back in North Korea. One day, my worst nightmare came true,  when I was caught by the Chinese police,  and brought to the police station for interrogation. Someone had accused me of being North Korean,  so they tested my Chinese language abilities,  and asked me tons of questions. I was so scared. I thought my heart was going to explode. If anything seemed unnatural, I could be imprisoned and repatriated. I thought my life was over. But I managed to control all the emotions inside me,  and answer the questions. After they finished questioning me,  one official said to another,  "This was a false report. She's not North Korean." And they let me go. It was a miracle. Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies. But many can be caught by the Chinese police,  and repatriated. These girls were so lucky. Even though they were caught,  they were eventually released, after heavy international pressure. These North Koreans were not so lucky. Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China  and repatriated to North Korea,  where they can be tortured, imprisoned, or publicly executed. Even though I was really fortunate to get out,  many other North Koreans have not been so lucky. It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities  and struggle so hard just to survive. Even after learning a new language and getting a job,  their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant. That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity,  I decided to risk going to South Korea. And I started a new life yet again. Settling down in South Korea  was a lot more challenging than I had expected. English was so important in South Korea,  so I had to start learning my third language. Also, I realized there was a wide gap between North and South. We are all Korean, but inside,  we have become very different, due to 67 years of division. I even went through an identity crisis. Am I South Korean or North Korean? Where am I from? Who am I? Suddenly, there was no country I could proudly call my own. Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy,  I made a plan -- I started studying for the university entrance exam. Just as I was starting to get used to my new life,  I received a shocking phone call. The North Korean authorities intercepted some money  that I sent to my family,  and, as a punishment, my family was going to be forcibly removed  to a desolate location in the countryside. They had to get out quickly. So I started planning how to help them escape. North Koreans have to travel incredible distances  on the path to freedom. It's almost impossible to cross the border  between North Korea and South Korea. So, ironically, I took a flight back to China  and headed toward the North Korean border. Since my family couldn't speak Chinese,  I had to guide them somehow through more than 2,000 miles  in China, and then into Southeast Asia. The journey by bus took one week,  and we were almost caught several times. One time, our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer. He took everyone's I.D. cards,  and he started asking them questions. Since my family couldn't understand Chinese,  I thought my family was going to be arrested. As the Chinese officer approached my family,  I impulsively stood up, and I told him  that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning. He looked at me suspiciously,  but luckily, he believed me. We made it all the way to the border of Laos. But I had to spend almost all my money  to bribe the border guards in Laos. But even after we got past the border,  my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing. After I paid the fine and bribe,  my family was released in one month. But soon after, my family was arrested and jailed again,  in the capital of Laos. This was one of the lowest points in my life. I did everything to get my family to freedom,  and we came so close,  but my family was thrown in jail,  just a short distance from the South Korean embassy. I went back and forth between the immigration office  and the police station,  desperately trying to get my family out. but I didn't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore. I lost all hope. At that moment, I heard one man's voice ask me,  "What's wrong?" I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask. In my broken English, and with a dictionary,  I explained the situation, and without hesitating,  the man went to the ATM,  and he paid the rest of the money for my family,  and two other North Koreans to get out of jail. I thanked him with all my heart, and I asked him,  "Why are you helping me?" "I'm not helping you," he said. "I'm helping the North Korean people." I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life. The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people,  when we needed it most. And he showed me that the kindness of strangers  and the support of the international community  are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need. Eventually, after our long journey,  my family and I were reunited in South Korea. But getting to freedom is only half the battle. Many North Koreans are separated from their families,  and when they arrive in a new country,  they start with little or no money. So we can benefit from the international community  for education, English language training, job training, and more. We can also act as a bridge  between the people inside North Korea and the outside world. Because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside,  and we send information and money  that is helping to change North Korea from inside. I've been so lucky, received so much help and inspiration in my life,  so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans  a chance to prosper with international support. I'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans  succeeding all over the world,  including the TED stage. Thank you. 
I live in South Central. This is South Central:  liquor stores,  fast food,  vacant lots. So the city planners, they get together and they figure  they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else,  so they change it to South Los Angeles,  like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city. This is South Los Angeles.   Liquor stores,  fast food,  vacant lots. Just like 26.5 million other Americans,  I live in a food desert,  South Central Los Angeles,  home of the drive-thru and the drive-by. Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys. People are dying from curable diseases  For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood  is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills,  which is probably eight, 10 miles away. I got tired of seeing this happening. And I was wondering, how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food,  if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects  that the present food system has on your neighborhood? I see wheelchairs bought and sold  like used cars. I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks. And I figured, this has to stop. So I figured that the problem is the solution. Food is the problem and food is the solution. Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip  to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides. So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house. It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway. It's 150 feet by 10 feet. Thing is, it's owned by the city. But you have to maintain it. So I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want,  since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it." And this is how I decided to maintain it. So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together  and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees,  you know, the whole nine, vegetables. What we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group,  where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life,  from all over the city, and it's completely volunteer,  and everything we do is free. And the garden, it was beautiful. And then somebody complained. The city came down on me,  and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden,  which this citation was turning into a warrant. And I'm like, "Come on, really? A warrant for planting food on a piece of land  that you could care less about?"   And I was like, "Cool. Bring it." Because this time it wasn't coming up. So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman,  and one of the Green Grounds members,  they put up a petition on Change.org,  and with 900 signatures, we were a success. We had a victory on our hands. My councilman even called in and said how they endorse  and love what we're doing. I mean, come on, why wouldn't they? L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns. They own 26 square miles of vacant lots. That's 20 Central Parks. That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants. Why in the hell would they not okay this? Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds. When one dollar's worth of green beans  will give you 75 dollars' worth of produce. It's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food. Growing your own food is like printing your own money. See, I have a legacy in South Central. I grew up there. I raised my sons there. And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality  that was manufactured for me by some other people,  and I'm manufacturing my own reality. See, I'm an artist. Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art. Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls,  me, I beautify lawns, parkways. I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth,  and the plants and the trees,  that's my embellishment for that cloth. You'd be surprised what the soil could do  if you let it be your canvas. You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is  and how it affects people. So what happened? I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education,  a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood. To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil. We are the soil. You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this. Gardening is the most therapeutic  and defiant act you can do,  especially in the inner city. Plus you get strawberries. I remember this time,  there was this mother and a daughter came,  it was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard,  and I came out and they looked so ashamed. So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there,  and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this. This is on the street for a reason. It made me feel ashamed to see people  that were this close to me that were hungry,  and this only reinforced why I do this,  and people asked me, "Fin, aren't you afraid  people are going to steal your food?" And I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it. That's why it's on the street. That's the whole idea. I want them to take it, but at the same time,  I want them to take back their health." There's another time when I put  a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles. These are the guys, they helped me unload the truck. It was cool, and they just shared the stories  about how this affected them and how  they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother,  and it was just cool to see how this changed them,  if it was only for that one moment. So Green Grounds has gone on to plant  maybe 20 gardens. We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins  and participate, and it's all volunteers. If kids grow kale, kids eat kale. If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.   But when none of this is presented to them,  if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body,  they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them. I see young people  and they want to work,  but they're in this thing where they're caught up --  I see kids of color and they're just on this track  that's designed for them,  that leads them to nowhere. So with gardening, I see an opportunity  where we can train these kids  to take over their communities,  to have a sustainable life. And when we do this, who knows? We might produce the next George Washington Carver. but if we don't change the composition of the soil,  we will never do this. Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do. I want to plant a whole block of gardens  where people can share in the food in the same block. I want to take shipping containers  and turn them into healthy cafes. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not talking about no free shit,  because free is not sustainable. The funny thing about sustainability,  you have to sustain it. What I'm talking about is putting people to work,  and getting kids off the street, and letting them know  the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food,  opening farmer's markets. So what I want to do here,  we gotta make this sexy. So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades,  gangstas, gangsta gardeners. We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is. If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta. Get gangsta with your shovel, okay? And let that be your weapon of choice. So basically, if you want to meet with me,  you know, if you want to meet,  don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs  and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit --  where you talk about doing some shit. If you want to meet with me, come to the garden  with your shovel so we can plant some shit. Peace. Thank you. Thank you. 
You probably all agree with me  that this is a very nice road. It's made of asphalt,  and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on,  but not always, especially not on these days as today,  when it's raining a lot. Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt. And especially if you then ride with your bicycle,  and pass these cars, then that's not very nice. Also, asphalt can create a lot of noise. It's a noisy material,  and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands,  very close to cities, then we would like a silent road. The solution for that is to make roads  out of porous asphalt. Porous asphalt, a material that we use now  in most of the highways in the Netherlands,  it has pores and water can just rain through it,  so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides,  and you have a road that's easy to drive on,  so no splash water anymore. Also the noise will disappear in these pores. Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear,  so it's a very silent road. It also has disadvantages, of course,  and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur. What is raveling? You see that in this road  that the stones at the surface come off. First you get one stone, then several more,  and more and more and more and more,  and then they -- well, I will not do that.   But they can damage your windshield,  so you're not happy with that. And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage. Sometimes you can create potholes with that. Ha. He's ready. Potholes, of course, that can become a problem,  but we have a solution. Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material. It's a porous asphalt, like I said, so you have only  a small amount of binder between the stones. Due to weathering, due to U.V. light, due to oxidation,  this binder, this bitumen,  the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink,  and if it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks,  and it delaminates from the aggregates. Then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates --  what we just saw here. To solve this problem, we thought of self-healing materials. If we can make this material self-healing,  then probably we have a solution. So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans,  and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces,  and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen. So then you have asphalt  with very small pieces of steel wool in it. Then you need a machine, like you see here,  that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine. Induction can heat, especially steel; it's very good at that. Then what you do is you heat up the steel,  you melt the bitumen,  and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks,  and the stones are again fixed to the surface. Today I use a microwave because I cannot take  the big induction machine here onstage. So a microwave is a similar system. So I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out  to see what happened. So this is the specimen coming out now. So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab  to heat up the specimens. We tested a lot of specimens there,  and then the government, they actually saw our results,  and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that." So they donated to us a piece of highway,  400 meters of the A58, where we had to make  a test track to test this material. So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road,  and then of course this road will last several years  without any damage. That's what we know from practice. So we took a lot of samples from this road  and we tested them in the lab. So we did aging on the samples,  did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine,  and healed them and tested them again. Several times we can repeat that. So actually, the conclusion from this research is that  if we go on the road every four years  with our healing machine -- this is the big version  we have made to go on the real road --  if we go on the road every four years  we can double the surface life of this road,  which of course saves a lot of money. Well, to conclude, I can say  that we made a material  using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers,  using induction energy to really  increase the surface life of the road,  double the surface life you can even do,  so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks. And now you're of course curious if it also worked. So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm. Actually, it still has to cool down first  before I can show you that the healing works. But I will do a trial. Let's see. Yeah, it worked. Thank you. 
When I was 11,  I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house. My father was listening to BBC News on his small, gray radio. There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then,  because the news mostly depressed him. "The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted. I didn't know what it meant,  but I could see that my father was very, very happy. "You can go to a real school now," he said. A morning that I will never forget. A real school. You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan  and made it illegal for girls to go to school. So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy  to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed  to be outside alone, to a secret school. It was the only way we both could be educated. Each day, we took a different route  so that no one would suspect where we were going. We would cover our books in grocery bags  so it would seem we were just out shopping. The school was in a house,  more than 100 of us packed in one small living room. It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer. We all knew we were risking our lives --  the teacher, the students and our parents. From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled  for a week because Taliban were suspicious. We always wondered what they knew about us. Were we being followed? Do they know where we live? We were scared,  but still, school was where we wanted to be. I was very lucky to grow up in a family  where education was prized and daughters were treasured. My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time. A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan,  he insisted that his daughter, my mom,  go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father. But my educated mother became a teacher. There she is. She retired two years ago, only to turn our house  into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood. And my father -- that's him --  he was the first ever in his family to receive an education. There was no question that his children  would receive an education, including his daughters,  despite the Taliban, despite the risks. To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children. During Taliban years, I remember  there were times I would get so frustrated by our life  and always being scared and not seeing a future. I would want to quit,  but my father,  he would say,  "Listen, my daughter,  you can lose everything you own in your life. Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war. But the one thing that will always remain with you  is what is here,  and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees,  we will. So do you still not want to continue?" Today I am 22. I was raised in a country that has been destroyed  by decades of war. Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school,  and had my family not been so committed to my education,  I would be one of them. Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College. When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather,  the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters,  was among the first to congratulate me. He not only brags about my college degree,  but also that I was the first woman,  and that I am the first woman  to drive him through the streets of Kabul. My family believes in me. I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me. That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10,  a global campaign to educate women. That's why I cofounded SOLA,  the first and perhaps only boarding school  for girls in Afghanistan,  a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school. The exciting thing is that I see students at my school  with ambition grabbing at opportunity. And I see their parents and their fathers  who, like my own, advocate for them,  despite and even in the face of daunting opposition. Like Ahmed. That's not his real name,  and I cannot show you his face,  but Ahmed is the father of one of my students. Less than a month ago, he and his daughter  were on their way from SOLA to their village,  and they literally missed being killed  by a roadside bomb by minutes. As he arrived home, the phone rang,  a voice warning him  that if he sent his daughter back to school,  they would try again. "Kill me now, if you wish," he said,  "but I will not ruin my daughter's future  because of your old and backward ideas." What I've come to realize about Afghanistan,  and this is something that is often dismissed in the West,  that behind most of us who succeed  is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter  and who sees that her success is his success. It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success. In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators  of a bright future for their daughters,  but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan,  we must have the support of men. Under the Taliban, girls who went to school  numbered in the hundreds --  remember, it was illegal. But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan. Afghanistan looks so different from here in America. I find that Americans see the fragility in changes. I fear that these changes will not last  much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal. But when I am back in Afghanistan,  when I see the students in my school  and their parents who advocate for them,  who encourage them, I see a promising future  and lasting change. To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities,  and every single day  the girls of SOLA remind me of that. Like me, they are dreaming big. Thank you. 
I have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother  who died in her exile:  "Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him. But don't you ever turn  into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary." since the Libyan Revolution broke out,  inspired by the waves of mass mobilization  in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions. I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya  to call for a day of rage  and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi. And there it was, a great revolution. Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront  calling for the fall of the regime,  raising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice. They have shown an exemplary bravery  in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi. They have shown a great sense of solidarity  from the far east to the far west to the south. Eventually, after a period of six months of brutal war  and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead,  we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant. However, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden,  a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions. For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime  destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society. Aware of the devastation and the challenges,  I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society,  calling for an inclusive and just transition  to democracy and national reconciliation. Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi  during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi --  almost 300 in Tripoli. After a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya,  and with unique enthusiasm,  I started organizing workshops  on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills. With an amazing group of women,  I co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace,  a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life,  to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women  and to lobby for our right  for equal participation in building democracy and peace. I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections,  an environment which was increasingly polarized,  an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion. I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace  to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law,  a law that would give every citizen, no matter what your background,  the right to vote and run,  and most importantly to stipulate on political parties  the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists,  creating the zipper list. Eventually, our initiative was adopted and successful. Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress  in the first elections ever in 52 years. However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections,  and of the revolution as a whole,  was fading out --  for every day we were waking up to the news of violence. One day we wake up to the news  of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs. On another day we wake up to the news  of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate. On another day we wake up to the news  of the assassination of army officers. And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias  and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners  and their disrespect of the rule of law. Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset,  became more polarized  and has driven away from the ideals and the principles --  freedom, dignity, social justice --  Intolerance, exclusion and revenge  became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution. I am here today not at all to inspire you  with our success story of the zipper list and the elections. I'm rather here today to confess  that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision. We did not prioritize right. For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya. Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates  bring peace and national reconciliation? No, it didn't. What is it, then? Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated  with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women? Maybe what was missing was not the women only,  but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion. Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building  more than it needed the elections,  which only reinforced polarization and division. Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine  more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine. We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage. We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy. We need to develop a feminine discourse  that not only honors but also implements  mercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition,  inclusion instead of exclusion. These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya  needs desperately in order to achieve peace. For peace has an alchemy,  between the feminine and masculine perspectives. That's the real zipper. And we need to establish that existentially  before we do so sociopolitically. According to a Quranic verse  "Salam" -- peace -- "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem." In turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions,  has the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" -- womb --  symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity  from which the male and the female,  from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from. And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it,  the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence. Thus we are told that "My mercy encompasses all things." Thus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger." May we all be granted a grace of mercy. Thank you. 
I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question,  which has an equally disturbing answer. My topic is the secrets of domestic violence,  and the question I'm going to tackle  is the one question everyone always asks:  Why does she stay? Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her? I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker  or an expert in domestic violence. I'm just one woman with a story to tell. I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College. I had moved to New York City for my first job  as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine. I had my first apartment,  my first little green American Express card,  and I had a very big secret. My secret was that I had this gun  loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head  by the man who I thought was my soulmate,  many, many times. The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth  held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me  more times than I can even remember. I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love,  a psychological trap disguised as love,  one that millions of women and even a few men  fall into every year. It may even be your story. I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor. I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College,  an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School. I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies  including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post. I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband  and we have three kids together. My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. So my first message for you is that domestic violence  happens to everyone --  all races, all religions, all income and education levels. It's everywhere. And my second message is that everyone thinks  domestic violence happens to women,  that it's a women's issue. Not exactly. Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse  happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships,  in other words, in families,  the last place we would want or expect to find violence,  which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing. I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth  who would stay with a man who beats me,  but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age. I was 22, and in the United States,  women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely  to be domestic violence victims  as women of other ages,  and over 500 women and girls this age  are killed every year by abusive partners,  boyfriends, and husbands in the United States. I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing  about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns. I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night. He sat next to me on the New York City subway,  and he started chatting me up. He told me two things. One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school,  and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank. But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting  was that he was smart and funny  and he looked like a farm boy. He had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks  and this wheat-blond hair,  and he seemed so sweet. One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning,  was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship. He did this especially at the beginning  by idolizing me. We started dating, and he loved everything about me,  that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard,  that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job. He wanted to know everything about my family  and my childhood and my hopes and dreams. Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman,  in a way that no one else ever had. And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us  by confessing his secret,  which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four,  he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused  by his stepfather,  and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade,  even though he was very smart,  and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life. Which is why that Ivy League degree  and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future  meant so much to him. If you had told me  that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me  would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup,  how short my skirts were,  where I lived, what jobs I took,  who my friends were and where I spent Christmas,  I would have laughed at you,  because there was not a hint of violence or control  or anger in Conor at the beginning. I didn't know that the first stage  in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim. I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim. Now, Conor did not come home one day and announce,  "You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great,  but I need to move into the next phase  where I isolate you and I abuse you" —  —  "so I need to get you out of this apartment  where the neighbors can hear you scream  and out of this city where you have friends and family  and coworkers who can see the bruises." Instead, Conor came home one Friday evening  and he told me that he had quit his job that day,  his dream job,  and he said that he had quit his job because of me,  because I had made him feel so safe and loved  that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore,  and he just wanted to get out of the city  and away from his abusive, dysfunctional family, and move to a tiny town in New England  where he could start his life over with me by his side. Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York,  and my dream job,  but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate,  so I agreed, and I quit my job,  and Conor and I left Manhattan together. I had no idea I was falling into crazy love,  that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid  physical, financial and psychological trap. The next step in the domestic violence pattern  is to introduce the threat of violence  and see how she reacts. And here's where those guns come in. As soon as we moved to New England -- you know,  that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe --  he bought three guns. He kept one in the glove compartment of our car. He kept one under the pillows on our bed,  and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times. And he said that he needed those guns  because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy. He needed them to feel protected. But those guns were really a message for me,  and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me,  my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day. Conor first physically attacked me  five days before our wedding. It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown. I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment,  and I got frustrated,  and Conor used my anger as an excuse  to put both of his hands around my neck  and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream,  and he used the chokehold  to hit my head repeatedly against the wall. Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,  and I put on my mother's wedding dress,  and I married him. Despite what had happened,  I was sure we were going to live happily ever after,  because I loved him, and he loved me so much. And he was very, very sorry. He had just been really stressed out by the wedding  and by becoming a family with me. It was an isolated incident,  and he was never going to hurt me again. It happened twice more on the honeymoon. The first time, I was driving to find a secret beach  and I got lost,  and he punched me in the side of my head so hard  that the other side of my head repeatedly hit  the driver's side window. And then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon,  he got frustrated by traffic,  and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face. Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week  for the next two and a half years of our marriage. I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique  and alone in this situation. One in three American women  experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life,  and the CDC reports that 15 million children  are abused every year, 15 million. So actually, I was in very good company. Back to my question:  Why did I stay? The answer is easy. I didn't know he was abusing me. Even though he held those loaded guns to my head,  pushed me down stairs,  threatened to kill our dog,  pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway,  poured coffee grinds on my head  as I dressed for a job interview,  I never once thought of myself as a battered wife. Instead, I was a very strong woman  in love with a deeply troubled man,  and I was the only person on Earth  who could help Conor face his demons. The other question everybody asks is,  why doesn't she just leave? Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time. To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask,  because we victims know something you usually don't:  It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser. Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern  is kill her. Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders  happen after the victim has ended the relationship,  after she's gotten out,  because then the abuser has nothing left to lose. Other outcomes include long-term stalking,  even after the abuser remarries;  denial of financial resources;  and manipulation of the family court system  to terrify the victim and her children,  who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time  with the man who beat their mother. And still we ask, why doesn't she just leave? I was able to leave,  because of one final, sadistic beating  that broke through my denial. I realized that the man who I loved so much  was going to kill me if I let him. So I broke the silence. I told everyone:  the police, my neighbors,  my friends and family, total strangers,  and I'm here today because you all helped me. We tend to stereotype victims  as grisly headlines, self-destructive women, damaged goods. The question, "Why does she stay?" is code for some people for, "It's her fault for staying,"  as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men  intent upon destroying us. But since publishing "Crazy Love,"  I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women  who also got out,  who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened,  and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives --  as employees, wives and mothers,  lives completely free of violence, like me. Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim  and a typical domestic violence survivor. I remarried a kind and gentle man,  and we have those three kids. I have that black lab, and I have that minivan. What I will never have again,  ever,  is a loaded gun held to my head  by someone who says that he loves me. Right now, maybe you're thinking,  "Wow, this is fascinating,"  or, "Wow, how stupid was she,"  but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you. I promise you there are several people  listening to me right now  who are currently being abused  or who were abused as children  or who are abusers themselves. Abuse could be affecting your daughter,  your sister, your best friend right now. I was able to end my own crazy love story  by breaking the silence. I'm still breaking the silence today. It's my way of helping other victims,  and it's my final request of you. Talk about what you heard here. Abuse thrives only in silence. You have the power to end domestic violence  simply by shining a spotlight on it. We victims need everyone. We need every one of you to understand  the secrets of domestic violence. with your children, your coworkers,  your friends and family. Recast survivors as wonderful, lovable people  with full futures. Recognize the early signs of violence  and conscientiously intervene,  deescalate it, show victims a safe way out. Together we can make our beds,  our dinner tables and our families  the safe and peaceful oases they should be. Thank you. 
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell,  and for the last little while, I've been a model. Actually, for 10 years. And I feel like  there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now  because I should not have worn this dress.   So luckily, I brought an outfit change. This is the first outfit change on the TED stage,  so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think. If some of the women were really horrified when I came out,  you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter. I'd also note that I'm quite privileged  to be able to transform what you think of me  in a very brief 10 seconds. Not everybody gets to do that. These heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them. The worst part is putting this sweater over my head,  because that's when you'll all laugh at me,  so don't do anything while it's over my head. All right. So, why did I do that? That was awkward. Well --  Hopefully not as awkward as that picture. Image is powerful,  but also, image is superficial. I just totally transformed what you thought of me, in six seconds. And in this picture,  I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life. I was totally uncomfortable,  and the photographer was telling me to arch my back  and put my hand in that guy's hair. And of course, barring surgery,  or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work,  there's very little that we can do to transform how we look,  and how we look, though it is superficial and immutable,  has a huge impact on our lives. So today, for me, being fearless means being honest. And I am on this stage because I am a model. I am on this stage because I am a pretty, white woman,  and in my industry, we call that a sexy girl. I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me,  but with an honest twist. So the first question is, how do you become a model? I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted," but that means nothing. The real way that I became a model  is I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy,  and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy. Well, for the past few centuries  we have defined beauty not just as health and youth  and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire,  but also as tall, slender figures,  and femininity and white skin. And this is a legacy that was built for me,  and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on. And I know there are people in the audience  who are skeptical at this point,  and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like,  "Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen." And first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive. But unfortunately, I have to inform you that in 2007,  a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student  counted all the models on the runway, every single one that was hired,  and of the 677 models that were hired,  only 27, or less than four percent, were non-white. The next question people always ask is,  "Can I be a model when I grow up?" And the first answer is, "I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that." But the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls is,  "Why? You know? You can be anything. You could be the President of the United States,  or the inventor of the next Internet,  or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet,  which would be awesome, because you'd be the first one." If, after this amazing list, they still are like,  "No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"  well, then I say, "Be my boss." Because I'm not in charge of anything,  and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue  or the CEO of H&amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel. Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up  is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up. It's out of your control, and it's awesome,  and it's not a career path. I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge,  because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,  it can just be distilled right now. So, if the photographer is right there,  the light is right there, like a nice HMI,  and the client says, "We want a walking shot,"  this leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,  the head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth,  just do that, and then you look back at your imaginary friends,  300, 400, 500 times.   It will look something like this. Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle. That was -- I don't know what happened there. Unfortunately, after you've gone to school,  and you have a résumé and you've done a few jobs,  you can't say anything anymore,  so if you say you want to be the President of the United States,  but your résumé reads, "Underwear Model: 10 years,"  people give you a funny look. The next question is, "Do they retouch all the photos?" And yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos,  but that is only a small component of what's happening. This picture is the very first picture that I ever took,  and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini,  and I didn't even have my period yet. I know we're getting personal, but I was a young girl. This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier. Here's me on the same day as this shoot. My friend got to come. Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue. Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine. And here's me today. And I hope what you're seeing  is that these pictures are not pictures of me. They are constructions,  and they are constructions by a group of professionals,  by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists  and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production,  and they build this. That's not me. Okay, so the next question people always ask me is,  "Do you get free stuff?" I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear,  except for earlier,  but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that's what we don't like to talk about. I grew up in Cambridge,  and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money  and they gave me the dress for free. When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend  who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course,  we got pulled over,  and all it took was a "Sorry, officer," and we were on our way. And I got these free things because of how I look,  not who I am, and there are people paying a cost  for how they look and not who they are. I live in New York, and last year,  of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked,  86% of them were black and Latino, and most of them were young men. And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York,  so for them, it's not a question of, "Will I get stopped?" but "How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?" When I was researching this talk,  I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States,  53% don't like their bodies,  and that number goes to 78% by the time that they're 17. So, the last question people ask me is,  "What is it like to be a model?" And I think the answer that they're looking for is,  "If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair,  you will be so happy and fabulous." And when we're backstage,  we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that. We say, "It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work  with creative, inspired, passionate people." And those things are true, but they're only one half of the story,  because the thing that we never say on camera,  that I have never said on camera, is,  "I am insecure." And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day. And if you ever are wondering,  "If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?" you just need to meet a group of models,  because they have the thinnest thighs, the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes,  and they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet. When I was writing this talk,  I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance, because on the one hand,  I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say,  "Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor,"  and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with,  "and it doesn't always make me happy." But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression  when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries. But I'm also happy and honored to be up here  before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career,  because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job,  or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college,  which seems so important right now. If there's a takeaway to this talk,  I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging  the power of image in our perceived successes  and our perceived failures. Thank you. 
ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera,  but today I want to share with you  the 15 most treasured photos of mine,  and I didn't take any of them. There were no art directors, no stylists,  no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting. In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists. My story begins  when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement,  and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter  on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th. We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later,  so we decided to take the same picture. Well you can see where this is going. Approaching my daughter's third birthday,  my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York  and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ritual?" This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture. the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger. No one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera. Back then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives. It's really become sacred to us. This one was taken just weeks after 9/11,  and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day  in ways a five-year-old could understand. So these photos are far more than proxies  for a single moment, or even a specific trip. They're also ways for us to freeze time  for one week in October  and reflect on our times  and how we change from year to year,  and not just physically, but in every way. Because while we take the same photo,  our perspectives change,  and she reaches new milestones,  and I get to see life through her eyes,  and how she interacts with and sees everything. This very focused time we get to spend together  is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year. Recently, on one trip, we were walking,  and she stops dead in her tracks,  and she points to a red awning of the doll store  that she loved when she was little  on our earlier trips. And she describes to me the feeling she felt  as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot. She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest  when she saw that place for the very first time  nine years earlier. And now what she's looking at in New York  are colleges,  because she's determined to go to school in New York. And it hit me: One of the most important things  we all make are memories. So I want to share the idea of taking an active role  in consciously creating memories. I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots,  I'm not in many of the family photos. I'm always the one taking the picture. So I want to encourage everyone today  to get in the shot,  and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask,  "Will you take our picture?" Thank you. 
I would like to talk to you about  a very special group of animals. There are 10,000 species of birds in the world. Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds. When you see a vulture like this, the first thing  that comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly,  greedy creatures that are just after your flesh,  associated with politicians.    I want to change that perception. I want to change  those feelings you have for these birds, because  they need our sympathy. They really do.   And I'll tell you why. First of all, why do they have such a bad press? When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832  on the Beagle, he saw the turkey vulture,  and he said, "These are disgusting birds  with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity."   You could not get a worse insult, and that from Charles Darwin.   You know, he changed his mind when he came back,  and I'll tell you why. They've also be associated with Disney —  —  personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters. More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press  —    —  these are the attributes that they associated  the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that. I want to challenge that. Do you know why? Because MPs  do not keep the environment clean.   MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases. They are hardly monogamous.    They are far from being extinct.   And, my favorite is, vultures are better looking.    So there's two types of vultures in this planet. There are the New World vultures that are mainly found  in the Americas, like the condors and the caracaras,  and then the Old World vultures, where we have  16 species. From these 16, 11 of them are facing  a high risk of extinction. So why are vultures important? First of all,  they provide vital ecological services. They clean up. They're our natural garbage collectors. They clean up carcasses right to the bone. They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax  that would otherwise spread and cause  huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals. Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are  no vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times  to decompose, and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases. Vultures also have tremendous historical significance. They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture. Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector  and the motherhood, and together with the cobra,  symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt. In Hindu mythology, Jatayu was the vulture god,  and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita  from the 10-headed demon Ravana. In Tibetan culture, they are performing very important  sky burials. In places like Tibet, there are no places  to bury the dead, or wood to cremate them,  so these vultures provide a natural disposal system. So what is the problem with vultures? We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya,  of which six are highly threatened with extinction. The reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason  that they're getting poisoned is because there's  human-wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities  are using this poison to target predators,  and in return, the vultures are falling victim to this. In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan,  four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered,  which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct,  and the reason is because they are falling prey  by consuming livestock that has been treated  with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac. This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India,  and they have taken a stand. Because there are no vultures, there's been a spread  in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites,  and when you have feral dogs, you have a huge time bomb  of rabies. The number of cases of rabies  has increased tremendously in India. Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa:  353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana. I am not against wind energy, but we need to work  with the governments, because wind turbines  do this to birds. They slice them in half. They are bird-blending machines. In West Africa, there's a horrific trade  of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market. So what's being done? Well, we're conducting research  on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them. We're trying to determine their basic ecology,  and see where they go. We can see that they travel different countries, so  if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you. We need to work with governments in regional levels. We're working with local communities. We're talking to them about appreciating vultures,  about the need from within to appreciate these  wonderful creatures and the services that they provide. How can you help? You can become active,  make noise. You can write a letter to your government  and tell them that we need to focus on these very  misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time  to spread the word. Spread the word. When you walk out of this room, you will be informed  about vultures, but speak to your families, to your children,  to your neighbors about vultures. They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said  he changed his mind because he watched them fly  effortlessly without energy in the skies. Kenya, this world, will be much poorer  without these wonderful species. Thank you very much. 
Everything I do, and everything I do professionally --  my life -- has been shaped  by seven years of work as a young man in Africa. From 1971 to 1977 --  I look young, but I'm not —  --  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia,  in projects of technical cooperation with African countries. I worked for an Italian NGO,  and every single project that we set up in Africa  failed. And I was distraught. I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people  and we were doing good work in Africa. Instead, everything we touched we killed. Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book,  "Ripples from the Zambezi,"  was a project where we Italians  decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food. So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia  in this absolutely magnificent valley  going down to the Zambezi River,  and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes  and zucchini and ... And of course the local people had absolutely no interest  in doing that, so we paid them to come and work,  and sometimes they would show up.   And we were amazed that the local people, in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture. But instead of asking them how come they were not  growing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here."   "Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation." And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully. We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato  would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size. And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians,  "Look how easy agriculture is." When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red,  overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river  and they ate everything.   And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!" And the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here."   "Why didn't you tell us?""You never asked." I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa,  but then I saw what the Americans were doing,  what the English were doing, what the French were doing,  and after seeing what they were doing,  I became quite proud of our project in Zambia. Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos. You should see the rubbish —  --  You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed  on unsuspecting African people. You want to read the book,  read "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo,  Zambian woman economist. The book was published in 2009. We Western donor countries have given the African continent  two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years. I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done. Just go and read her book. Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done. We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries,  and there are only two ways we deal with people:  We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic. The two words come from the Latin root "pater,"  which means "father." But they mean two different things. Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture  as if they were my children. "I love you so much." Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture  as if they were my servants. That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss. I was given a slap in the face reading a book,  "Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said,  above all in economic development, if people  do not wish to be helped, leave them alone. This should be the first principle of aid. The first principle of aid is respect. This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference  lay a stick on the floor, and said,  "Can we -- can you imagine a city  that is not neocolonial?" I decided when I was 27 years old  to only respond to people,  and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation,  where you never initiate anything,  you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant  of the local passion, the servant of local people  who have a dream to become a better person. So what you do -- you shut up. You never arrive in a community with any ideas,  and you sit with the local people. We don't work from offices. We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub. We have zero infrastructure. And what we do, we become friends,  and we find out what that person wants to do. The most important thing is passion. You can give somebody an idea. If that person doesn't want to do it,  what are you going to do? The passion that the person has for her own growth  is the most important thing. The passion that that man has for his own personal growth  is the most important thing. And then we help them to go and find the knowledge,  because nobody in the world can succeed alone. The person with the idea may not have the knowledge,  but the knowledge is available. So years and years ago, I had this idea:  Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community  to tell people what to do, why don't, for once,  listen to them? But not in community meetings. Let me tell you a secret. There is a problem with community meetings. Entrepreneurs never come,  and they never tell you, in a public meeting,  what they want to do with their own money,  what opportunity they have identified. So planning has this blind spot. The smartest people in your community you don't even know,  because they don't come to your public meetings. What we do, we work one-on-one,  and to work one-on-one, you have to create  a social infrastructure that doesn't exist. You have to create a new profession. The profession is the family doctor of enterprise,  the family doctor of business, who sits with you  in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe,  and helps you find the resources to transform your passion  into a way to make a living. I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia. I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time,  trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit  that we arrive and tell you what to do. And so what I did in Esperance that first year  was to just walk the streets, and in three days  I had my first client, and I helped this first guy  who was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy,  and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth,  to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say,  "You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?" And I helped these five fishermen to work together  and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany  for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way  to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo,  and the farmers came to talk to me, said,  "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?" In a year, I had 27 projects going on,  and the government came to see me to say,  "How can you do that? How can you do — ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult. I shut up, and listen to them."   So —  —  So the government says, "Do it again."   We've done it in 300 communities around the world. We have helped to start 40,000 businesses. There is a new generation of entrepreneurs  who are dying of solitude. Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history,  died age 96, a few years ago. Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy  before becoming involved in business,  and this is what Peter Drucker says:  "Planning is actually incompatible  with an entrepreneurial society and economy." Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship. So now you're rebuilding Christchurch  without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch  want to do with their own money and their own energy. You have to learn how to get these people  to come and talk to you. You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy,  you have to be fantastic at helping them,  and then they will come, and they will come in droves. In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients. Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people,  the intelligence and the passion? Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning? Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded. So what I'm saying is that  entrepreneurship is where it's at. We are at the end of the first industrial revolution --  nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing --  and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable. The internal combustion engine is not sustainable. Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable. What we have to look at is at how we  for seven billion people in a sustainable way. The technologies do not exist to do that. Who is going to invent the technology  for the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it! Government? Forget about it! It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now. There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine  many, many years ago. There was a group of experts who were invited  to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860. And in 1860, this group of people came together,  and they all speculated about what would happen  to the city of New York in 100 years,  and the conclusion was unanimous:  The city of New York would not exist in 100 years. Why? Because they looked at the curve and said,  if the population keeps growing at this rate,  to move the population of New York around,  they would have needed six million horses,  and the manure created by six million horses  would be impossible to deal with. They were already drowning in manure.   So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology  that is going to choke the life out of New York. So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900,  in the United States of America, there were 1,001  car manufacturing companies -- 1,001. The idea of finding a different technology  had absolutely taken over,  and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters. Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford. However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs. First, you have to offer them confidentiality. Otherwise they don't come and talk to you. Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated,  passionate service to them. And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship. The smallest company, the biggest company,  has to be capable of doing three things beautifully:  The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic,  you have to have fantastic marketing,  and you have to have tremendous financial management. Guess what? We have never met a single human being  in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money. It doesn't exist. This person has never been born. We've done the research, and we have looked  at the 100 iconic companies of the world --  Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford,  all the new companies, Google, Yahoo. There's only one thing that all the successful companies  in the world have in common, only one:  None were started by one person. Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds  in Northumberland, and we start the class  by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography,  and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline,  in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography  how many times Richard uses the word "I"  and how many times he uses the word "we." Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times. He wasn't alone when he started. Nobody started a company alone. No one. So we can create the community  where we have facilitators who come from a small business background  sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies  who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman  who talks about this epic,  somebody who will say to you, "What do you need? What can you do? Can you make it? Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?" "Oh, no, I cannot do this.""Would you like me to find you somebody?" We activate communities. We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator  to help you to find resources and people  and we have discovered that the miracle  of the intelligence of local people is such  that you can change the culture and the economy  of this community just by capturing the passion,  the energy and imagination of your own people. Thank you. 
There are a lot of ways the people around us  can help improve our lives. We don't bump into every neighbor,  so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on,  though we do share the same public spaces. So over the past few years, I've tried ways to share more  using simple tools like stickers, stencils and chalk. And these projects came from questions I had, like:  How much are my neighbors paying for their apartments? How can we lend and borrow more things,  without knocking on each other's doors at a bad time? How can we share more memories of our abandoned buildings,  and gain a better understanding of our landscape? How can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts,  so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today? Now, I live in New Orleans,  and I am in love with New Orleans. My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees,  shading lovers, drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years,  and I trust a city that always makes way for music. I feel like every time someone sneezes,  New Orleans has a parade.   The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world,  but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America. I live near this house,  and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood,  and I also thought about something that changed my life forever. In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much. Her name was Joan, and she was a mother to me. And her death was sudden and unexpected. And I thought about death a lot. And ... this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had. And ... brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now. But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life. I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day,  and forget what really matters to you. So with help from old and new friends,  I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard,  and stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence:  "Before I die, I want to ..." So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk,  reflect on their life,  and share their personal aspirations in public space. I didn't know what to expect from this experiment,  but by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out,  and it kept growing. And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall. "Before I die, I want to be tried for piracy."   "Before I die, I want to straddle the International Dateline." "Before I die, I want to sing for millions." "Before I die, I want to plant a tree." "Before I die, I want to live off the grid." "Before I die, I want to hold her one more time." "Before I die, I want to be someone's cavalry." "Before I die, I want to be completely myself." So this neglected space became a constructive one,  and people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud, tear up,  and they consoled me during my own tough times. It's about knowing you're not alone;  it's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways;  it's about making space for reflection and contemplation,  and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change. I made this last year,  and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people  who wanted to make a wall with their community. So, my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit,  and now walls have been made in countries around the world,  including Kazakhstan, South Africa,  Australia,  Argentina, and beyond. Together, we've shown how powerful our public spaces can be  if we're given the opportunity to have a voice,  and share more with one another. Two of the most valuable things we have  are time, and our relationships with other people. In our age of increasing distractions,  it's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective,  and remember that life is brief and tender. Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about,  or even think about,  but I've realized that preparing for death  is one of the most empowering things you can do. Thinking about death clarifies your life. Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us,  as individuals and as a community,  and with more ways to share our hopes, fears and stories,  the people around us can not only help us make better places,  they can help us lead better lives. Thank you. Thank you. 
Today I have just one request. Please don't tell me I'm normal. Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers. Remi is 22,  tall and very handsome. He's speechless, but he communicates joy  in a way that some of the best orators cannot. Remi knows what love is. He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless. He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color. He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this:  He has never told a lie. When he sings songs from our childhood,  attempting words that not even I could remember,  he reminds me of one thing:  how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful  the unknown must be. Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome. He has the most impeccable memory. He has a selective one, though. He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar,  but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod,  conversations we had when he was four,  weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies,  and Lady Gaga's birthday. Don't they sound incredible? But most people don't agree. And in fact, because their minds don't fit  into society's version of normal,  they're often bypassed and misunderstood. But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul  was that even though this was the case,  although they were not seen as ordinary,  this could only mean one thing:  that they were extraordinary --  autistic and extraordinary. Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term "autism,"  it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication,  learning and sometimes physical skills. It manifests in each individual differently,  hence why Remi is so different from Sam. And across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person  is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of  the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world,  there is no known cause or cure. And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism,  but I cannot recall a day without it. I was just three years old when my brother came along,  and I was so excited that  I had a new being in my life. And after a few months went by,  I realized that he was different. He screamed a lot. He didn't want to play like the other babies did,  and in fact, he didn't seem  very interested in me whatsoever. Remi lived and reigned in his own world, with his own rules,  and he found pleasure in the smallest things,  like lining up cars around the room  and staring at the washing machine  and eating anything that came in between. And as he grew older, he grew more different,  and the differences became more obvious. Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration  and the never-ending hyperactivity  was something really unique:  a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world  without prejudice, a human who had never lied. Extraordinary. Now, I cannot deny that there have been  some challenging moments in my family,  moments where I've wished that they were just like me. But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me  about individuality and communication and love,  and I realize that these are things that  I wouldn't want to change with normality. Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us,  and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong. It just means that there's a different kind of right. And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi  and to Sam  and to you,  it would be that you don't have to be normal. You can be extraordinary. Because autistic or not,  the differences that we have --  We've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us,  and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality  is the ultimate sacrifice of potential. The chance for greatness, for progress and for change  dies the moment we try to be like someone else. Please -- don't tell me I'm normal. Thank you. 
Five years ago, I experienced a bit  of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland. Penn State asked me, a communications teacher,  to teach a communications class for engineering students. And I was scared.   Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains  and their big books and their big, unfamiliar words. But as these conversations unfolded,  I experienced what Alice must have when she went down  that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world. That's just how I felt as I had those conversations  with the students. I was amazed at the ideas  that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well. And I believe the key to opening that door  is great communication. We desperately need great communication from our  scientists and engineers in order to change the world. Our scientists and engineers are the ones  that are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy  to environment to health care, among others,  and if we don't know about it and understand it,  then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility  as non-scientists to have these interactions. But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists  and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland. So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us. I want to share a few keys on how you can do that  to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy  and that your engineering is engaging. First question to answer for us: so what? Tell us why your science is relevant to us. Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae,  but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones  because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis. And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon. Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas. Sure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say  "space and time," which is so much more accessible to us? And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down. Instead, as Einstein said, make everything  as simple as possible, but no simpler. You can clearly communicate your science  without compromising the ideas. A few things to consider are having examples, stories  and analogies. Those are ways to engage  and excite us about your content. And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points. Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points?   What do bullets do? Bullets kill,  and they will kill your presentation. A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much  on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed. Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is  much more effective. It's showing that the special structure  of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower. And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence  that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost,  and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses  and create a deeper sense of understanding  of what's being described. So I think these are just a few keys that can help  the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland  that is science and engineering. And because the engineers that I've worked with have  taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd,  I want to summarize with an equation.   Take your science, subtract your bullet points  and your jargon, divide by relevance,  meaning share what's relevant to the audience,  and multiply it by the passion that you have for  this incredible work that you're doing,  and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding. And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved  this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me.   Thank you. 
One of my favorite words in the whole of  the Oxford English Dictionary is "snollygoster." Just because it sounds so good. And what snollygoster means is  "a dishonest politician." Although there was a 19th-century  newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said,  "A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office  regardless of party, platform or principle,  and who, when he wins,  gets there by the sheer force  of monumental talknophical assumnancy." Now I have no idea what "talknophical" is. Something to do with words, I assume. But it's very important that words are at the center of politics,  and all politicians know they have to try and control language. It wasn't until, for example, 1771  that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report  the exact words that were said in the debating chamber. And this was actually all down to the bravery  of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby,  who took on Parliament. And he was thrown into the Tower of London  and imprisoned,  but he was brave enough,  he was brave enough to take them on,  and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won. And it was only a few years later  that we have the first recorded use of the phrase  "as bold as brass." Most people think that's down to the metal. It's not. It's down to a campaigner  for the freedom of the press. But to really show you how  words and politics interact,  I want to take you back to the United States of America,  just after they'd achieved independence. And they had to face the question  of what to call George Washington, their leader. They didn't know. What do you call the leader of a republican country? And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages. And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table,  which might have made it. I mean, some people wanted him to be called  Chief Magistrate Washington,  and other people, His Highness George Washington,  and other people, Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington. Not that catchy. Some people just wanted to call him King. They thought it was tried and tested. And they weren't even being monarchical there,  they had the idea that you could be elected King  for a fixed term. And, you know, it could have worked. And everybody got insanely bored, actually,  because this debate went on for three weeks. I read a diary of this poor senator,  who just keeps coming back, "Still on this subject." And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that  the House of Representatives were against the Senate. The House of Representatives didn't want Washington  to get drunk on power. They didn't want to call him King  in case that gave him ideas, or his successor ideas. So they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest,  most pathetic title that they could think of. And that title was "President." President. They didn't invent the title. I mean, it existed before,  but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting. It was like the foreman of the jury. And it didn't have much more grandeur  than the term "foreman" or "overseer." There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils  and bits of government, but it was really a nothing title. And that's why the Senate objected to it. They said, that's ridiculous, you can't call him President. This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries. And who's going to take him seriously  if he's got a silly little title  like President of the United States of America? And after three weeks of debate, in the end  the Senate did not cave in. Instead, they agreed to use the title "President" for now,  but they also wanted it absolutely set down  that they didn't agree with it  from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations,  whether under republican or monarchical forms of government,  whose custom it is to annex,  through the office of the Chief Magistrate, titles of respectability --  not bloody President --  and that in the intercourse with foreign nations, the majesty of the people of the United States  may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity,  i.e., we don't want to look like bloody weirdos. Now you can learn three interesting things from this. First of all -- and this is my favorite --  is that so far as I've ever been able to find out,  the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President. Barack Obama, President Obama, is there on borrowed time,  just waiting for the Senate to spring into action. Second thing you can learn is that  when a government says that this is a temporary measure --   --  you can still be waiting 223 years later. But the third thing you can learn,  and this is the really important one,  this is the point I want to leave you on,  is that the title, President of the United States of America,  doesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it? Something to do with the slightly over 5,000  nuclear warheads he has at his disposal  and the largest economy in the world  and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff. Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur. And so the Senate won in the end. They got their title of respectability. And also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity --  well, it was a singularity back then. But now, do you know how many nations have a president? All because they want to sound like  the guy who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc. And so, in the end, the Senate won  and the House of Representatives lost,  because nobody's going to feel that humble  when they're told that they are now  the President of the United States of America. And that's the important lesson I think you can take away,  and the one I want to leave you with. Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality  and control reality, but in fact,  reality changes words far more  than words can ever change reality. Thank you very much. 
I'm 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana. The air is thick with heat and dust,  and it's hard to breathe. I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me  in the darkness, but I can't see much else. I hear voices talking, but mostly the shaft  is this cacophony of men coughing,  and stone being broken with primitive tools. Like the others, I wear a flickering, cheap flashlight  tied to my head with this elastic, tattered band,  and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs  holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole  dropping hundreds of feet into the earth. When my hand slips, I suddenly remember a miner  I had met days before who had lost his grip  and fell countless feet down that shaft. As I stand talking to you today,  these men are still deep in that hole,  risking their lives without payment or compensation,  and often dying. I got to climb out of that hole, and I got to go home,  but they likely never will, because they're trapped in slavery. For the last 28 years, I've been documenting  indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries  on six continents, and in 2009 I had the great honor  of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit. Amongst all the astonishing people I met there,  I met a supporter of Free the Slaves, an NGO  dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery. We started talking about slavery, and really,  I started learning about slavery,  for I had certainly known it existed in the world,  but not to such a degree. After we finished talking, I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge  of this atrocity in my own lifetime, and I thought,  if I don't know, how many other people don't know? It started burning a hole in my stomach, so within weeks,  I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director  of Free the Slaves and offer them my help. Thus began my journey into modern day slavery. Oddly, I had been to many of these places before. Some I even considered like my second home. But this time, I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet. A conservative estimate tells us there are more than  27 million people enslaved in the world today. That's double the amount of people taken from Africa  during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade. A hundred and fifty years ago, an agricultural slave  cost about three times the annual salary  That equates to about $50,000 in today's money. Yet today, entire families can be enslaved for generations  over a debt as small as $18. Astonishingly, slavery generates profits  of more than $13 billion worldwide each year. Many have been tricked by false promises  of a good education, a better job, only to find  that they're forced to work without pay  under the threat of violence, and they cannot walk away. Today's slavery is about commerce,  so the goods that enslaved people produce have value,  but the people producing them are disposable. Slavery exists everywhere, nearly, in the world,  and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world. In India and Nepal, I was introduced to the brick kilns. This strange and awesome sight was like  walking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno. Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees,  men, women, children, entire families in fact,  were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust,  while mechanically stacking bricks on their head,  up to 18 at a time, and carrying them  from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away. Deadened by monotony and exhaustion,  they work silently, doing this task over and over  for 16 or 17 hours a day. There were no breaks for food, no water breaks,  and the severe dehydration made urinating  pretty much inconsequential. So pervasive was the heat and the dust  that my camera became too hot to even touch  and ceased working. Every 20 minutes, I'd have to run back to our cruiser  to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner  to revive it, and as I sat there,  I thought, my camera is getting far better treatment  than these people. Back in the kilns, I wanted to cry,  but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me  and he said, "Lisa, don't do that. Just don't do that here." And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays  are very dangerous in a place like this,  not just for me, but for them. I couldn't offer them any direct help. I couldn't give them money, nothing. I wasn't a citizen of that country. I could get them in a worse situation  than they were already in. I'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work  within the system for their liberation,  and I trusted that they would. As for me, I'd have to wait until I got home  to really feel my heartbreak. In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stone  for miles down mountainous terrain  to trucks waiting at roads below. The big sheets of slate were heavier  than the children carrying them,  and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope  and torn cloth. It's difficult to witness something so overwhelming. How can we affect something so insidious,  yet so pervasive? Some don't even know they're enslaved,  people working 16, 17 hours a day without any pay,  because this has been the case all their lives. They have nothing to compare it to. When these villagers claimed their freedom,  the slaveholders burned down all of their houses. I mean, these people had nothing,  and they were so petrified, they wanted to give up,  but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere,  and abolitionists on the ground  helped them get a quarry lease of their own,  so that now they do the same back-breaking work,  but they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it,  and they do it in freedom. Sex trafficking is what we often think of  when we hear the word slavery,  and because of this worldwide awareness,  I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry. In Kathmandu, I was escorted by women who had  previously been sex slaves themselves. They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs  that led to this dirty, dimly fluorescent lit basement. This wasn't a brothel, per se. It was more like a restaurant. Cabin restaurants, as they're known in the trade,  are venues for forced prostitution. Each has small, private rooms, where the slaves,  women, along with young girls and boys,  some as young as seven years old,  are forced to entertain the clients,  encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol. Each cubicle is dark and dingy,  identified with a painted number on the wall,  and partitioned by plywood and a curtain. The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse  at the hands of their customers. Standing in the near darkness, I remember feeling  this quick, hot fear, and in that instant,  I could only imagine what it must be like  to be trapped in that hell. I had only one way out: the stairs from where I'd come in. There were no back doors. There were no windows large enough to climb through. These people have no escape at all,  and as we take in such a difficult subject,  it's important to note that slavery, including sex trafficking,  occurs in our own backyard as well. Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture,  in restaurants, in domestic servitude,  and the list can go on. Recently, the New York Times reported that  between 100,000 and 300,000 American children  are sold into sex slavery every year. It's all around us. We just don't see it. The textile industry is another one we often think of  when we hear about slave labor. I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved  in the silk trade. This is a family portrait. The dyed black hands are the father, while the blue  and red hands are his sons. They mix dye in these big barrels,  and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows,  but the dye is toxic. My interpreter told me their stories. "We have no freedom," they said. "We hope still, though, that we could leave this house  someday and go someplace else  where we actually get paid for our dyeing." It's estimated that more than 4,000 children  are enslaved on Lake Volta,  the largest man-made lake in the world. When we first arrived, I went to have a quick look. I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat,  two older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense right? Wrong. They were all enslaved. Children are taken from their families  and trafficked and vanished,  and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats  on the lake, even though they do not know how to swim. This young child is eight years old. He was trembling when our boat approached,  frightened it would run over his tiny canoe. He was petrified he would be knocked in the water. The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta  often catch the fishing nets, and weary,  frightened children are thrown into the water  to untether the lines. Many of them drown. For as long as he can recall, he's been forced to work  on the lake. Terrified of his master, he will not run away,  and since he's been treated with cruelty all his life,  he passes that down to the younger slaves  I met these boys at five in the morning,  when they were hauling in the last of their nets,  but they had been working since 1 a.m. in the cold, windy night. And it's important to note that these nets weigh  more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish. I want to introduce you to Kofi. Kofi was rescued from a fishing village. I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves  rehabilitates victims of slavery. Here he's seen taking a bath at the well,  pouring big buckets of water over his head,  and the wonderful news is,  as you and I are sitting here talking today,  Kofi has been reunited with his family,  and what's even better, his family has been given tools  to make a living and to keep their children safe. Kofi is the embodiment of possibility. Who will he become because someone took a stand  and made a difference in his life? Driving down a road in Ghana  with partners of Free the Slaves,  a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up  to our cruiser and tapped on the window. He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle. At the end of the road, he urged us out of the car,  and told the driver to quickly leave. Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath,  and said, "This is the path, this is the path. Go." As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines  blocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in,  found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains,  so I hoisted the photo gear above my head  After another two hours of hiking, the winding trail  abruptly ended at a clearing, and before us  was a mass of holes  that could fit into the size of a football field, and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring. Many women had children strapped to their backs  while they were panning for gold,  wading in water poisoned by mercury. Mercury is used in the extraction process. These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft  in another part of Ghana. When they came out of the shaft, they were soaking wet  from their own sweat. I remember looking into their tired, bloodshot eyes,  for many of them had been underground for 72 hours. The shafts are up to 300 feet deep, and they carry out  heavy bags of stone that later will be transported  to another area, where the stone will be pounded  so that they can extract the gold. At first glance, the pounding site seems full  of powerful men, but when we look closer,  we see some less fortunate working on the fringes,  and children too. All of them are victim to injury, illness and violence. In fact, it's very likely that this muscular person  will end up like this one here, racked with tuberculosis  and mercury poisoning in just a few years. This is Manuru. When his father died,  his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines. When his uncle died, Manuru inherited his uncle's debt,  which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines. When I met him, he had been working in the mines  for 14 years, and the leg injury that you see here  is actually from a mining accident,  one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated. On top of that, Manuru has tuberculosis,  yet he's still forced to work day in and day out  in that mine shaft. Even still, he has a dream that he will become free  and become educated with the help of local activists  like Free the Slaves,  and it's this sort of determination,  in the face of unimaginable odds,  that fills me with complete awe. I want to shine a light on slavery. When I was working in the field,  I brought lots of candles with me,  and with the help of my interpreter,  I imparted to the people I was photographing  that I wanted to illuminate their stories  and their plight,  so when it was safe for them, and safe for me,  I made these images. They knew their image would be seen  by you out in the world. I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness  to them, and that we will do whatever we can  to help make a difference in their lives. I truly believe, if we can see one another  as fellow human beings, then it becomes very difficult  to tolerate atrocities like slavery. These images are not of issues. They are of people,  real people, like you and me, all deserving  of the same rights, dignity and respect  There is not a day that goes by that I don't think  of these many beautiful, mistreated people  I've had the tremendous honor of meeting. I hope that these images awaken a force  in those who view them, people like you,  and I hope that force will ignite a fire,  and that fire will shine a light on slavery,  for without that light, the beast of bondage  can continue to live in the shadows. Thank you very much. 
So, well, I do applied math,  for anyone who does applied math, is that  we are like management consultants. No one knows what the hell we do. So I am going to give you some -- attempt today  to try and explain to you what I do. So, dancing is one of the most human of activities. We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers  you will see later on. Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise  and a high level of skill,  and probably a level of initial suitability  that may well have a genetic component to it. Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease  gradually destroy this extraordinary ability,  as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was  a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time. So great progress and treatment has been made over the years. However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide  who have the disease, and they have to live with  incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity  and the other symptoms that go along with the disease,  so what we need are objective tools  to detect the disease before it's too late. We need to be able to measure progression objectively,  and ultimately, the only way we're going to know  when we actually have a cure is when we have  an objective measure that can answer that for sure. But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease  and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers,  so there's no simple blood test that you can do,  and the best that we have is like  this 20-minute neurologist test. You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly,  and that means that, outside the clinical trials,  it's just never done. It's never done. But what if patients could do this test at home? Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic,  and what if patients could do that test themselves, right? No expensive staff time required. Takes about $300, by the way, in the neurologist's clinic to do it. So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way  in which we can try to achieve this,  because, you see, in one sense, at least,  we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling. So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds. Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds,  and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers,  because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs  when we make sounds, and we all actually  have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example. And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training. I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak. From the sound, we can actually track  the vocal fold position as it vibrates,  and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's,  so too are the vocal organs. So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of  irregular vocal fold tremor. We see all the same symptoms. We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity. The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy  after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it. So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle,  in some cases, but with any digital microphone,  and using precision voice analysis software  in combination with the latest in machine learning,  which is very advanced by now,  we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies  on a continuum between health and disease  using voice signals alone. So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against  expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive. The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure. You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it. And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition,  voice-based tests are non-expert. That means they can be self-administered. They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most. They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens. When something becomes ultra-low cost,  it becomes massively scalable. So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now. We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients. No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup. We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data. We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials,  and we can make population-scale screening  feasible for the first time. We have the opportunity to start to search  for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late. So, taking the first steps towards this today,  we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative. With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming  to record a very large number of voices worldwide  to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals. We have local numbers accessible to three quarters  of a billion people on the planet. Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply,  and leave recordings, a few cents each,  and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit  six percent of our target just in eight hours. Thank you.     Tom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,  let's say, 10,000 people,  you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not? What are you going to get out of those samples? Max Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that,  during the call you have to indicate whether or not  you have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right. ML: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it. But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected  from all different circumstances, and it's getting it  in different circumstances that matter because then  we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors,  and looking for the actual markers of the disease. TR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now? ML: It's much better than that. Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him,  because he's done some fantastic work,  and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well,  which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy. TR: Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement. So what that means is that people will be able to —  ML:   TR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones  and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in,  record their voice, and then their doctor can check up  on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease. ML: Absolutely. TR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody. ML: Thanks, Tom. 
Before March, 2011, I was a photographic retoucher  based in New York City. We're pale, gray creatures. We hide in dark, windowless rooms,  and generally avoid sunlight. We make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect,  and the impossible possible,  and we get criticized in the press all the time,  but some of us are actually talented artists  with years of experience  and a real appreciation for images and photography. On March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest  of the world did, as the tragic events unfolded in Japan. Soon after, an organization I volunteer with,  All Hands Volunteers, were on the ground, within days,  working as part of the response efforts. I, along with hundreds of other volunteers,  knew we couldn't just sit at home,  so I decided to join them for three weeks. On May the 13th, I made my way to the town of Ōfunato. It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture,  about 50,000 people,  one of the first that was hit by the wave. The waters here have been recorded at reaching  over 24 meters in height,  and traveled over two miles inland. As you can imagine, the town had been devastated. We pulled debris from canals and ditches. We cleaned schools. We de-mudded and gutted homes  ready for renovation and rehabilitation. We cleared tons and tons of stinking, rotting fish carcasses  from the local fish processing plant. We got dirty, and we loved it. For weeks, all the volunteers and locals alike  had been finding similar things. They'd been finding photos and photo albums  and cameras and SD cards. And everyone was doing the same. They were collecting them up, and handing them in to  various places around the different towns for safekeeping. Now, it wasn't until this point that I realized  that these photos were such a huge part  of the personal loss these people had felt. As they had run from the wave, and for their lives,  absolutely everything they had,  everything had to be left behind. At the end of my first week there, I found myself  helping out in an evacuation center in the town. I was helping clean the onsen, the communal onsen,  the huge giant bathtubs. This happened to also be a place in the town where  the evacuation center was collecting the photos. This is where people were handing them in,  and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me  to help them start hand-cleaning them. Now, it was emotional and it was inspiring,  and I've always heard about thinking outside the box,  but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box  that something happened. As I looked through the photos, there were some  were over a hundred years old,  some still in the envelope from the processing lab,  I couldn't help but think as a retoucher  that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch,  and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same. So that evening, I just reached out on Facebook  and asked a few of them, and by morning  the response had been so overwhelming and so positive,  I knew we had to give it a go. So we started retouching photos. This was the very first. Not terribly damaged, but where the water had caused  that discoloration on the girl's face  had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy. Otherwise, that little girl isn't going to look  like that little girl anymore, and surely that's as tragic  as having the photo damaged. Over time, more photos came in, thankfully,  and more retouchers were needed,  and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn,  and within five days, 80 people wanted to help  from 12 different countries. Within two weeks, I had 150 people  wanting to join in. Within Japan, by July, we'd branched out  to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata,  further north to a town called Yamada. Once a week, we would set up our scanning equipment  in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up,  where people were reclaiming their photos. The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before,  but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo,  they could give it to us, have it scanned,  uploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded  by a gaijin, a stranger,  somewhere on the other side of the globe,  and it'd start being fixed. The time it took, however, to get it back  is a completely different story,  and it depended obviously on the damage involved. It could take an hour. It could take weeks. It could take months. The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn,  or pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color  and detail that the water hadn't damaged. It was very time-consuming. Now, all these photos had been damaged by water,  submerged in salt water, covered in bacteria,  in sewage, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time  is going to continue to damage them,  so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project. We couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned,  dry and reclaimed. Now, we were lucky with our hand-cleaning. We had an amazing local woman who guided us. It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos. As my team leader Wynne once said,  it's like doing a tattoo on someone. You don't get a chance to mess it up. The lady who brought us these photos was lucky,  as far as the photos go. She had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped  when she realized she was doing more damage. She also had duplicates. Areas like her husband and her face, which otherwise  would have been completely impossible to fix,  we could just put them together in one good photo,  and remake the whole photo. When she collected the photos from us,  she shared a bit of her story with us. Her photos were found by her husband's colleagues  at a local fire department in the debris  a long way from where the home had once stood,  and they'd recognized him. The day of the tsunami, he'd actually been in charge  of making sure the tsunami gates were closed. He had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded. Her two little boys, not so little anymore, but her two boys  were both at school, separate schools. One of them got caught up in the water. It took her a week to find them all again  and find out that they had all survived. The day I gave her the photos also happened to be  her youngest son's 14th birthday. For her, despite all of this, those photos  were the perfect gift back to him,  something he could look at again, something he remembered from before  that wasn't still scarred from that day in March  when absolutely everything else in his life had changed  or been destroyed. After six months in Japan,  1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands,  hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean  over 135,000 photographs,  the large majority —  —  a large majority of which did actually find their home again,  importantly. Over five hundred volunteers around the globe  helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back,  fully restored and retouched. During this time, we hadn't really spent more than  about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials,  most of which was printer inks. We take photos constantly. A photo is a reminder of someone or something,  a place, a relationship, a loved one. They're our memory-keepers and our histories,  the last thing we would grab  and the first thing you'd go back to look for. That's all this project was about,  about restoring those little bits of humanity,  giving someone that connection back. When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this,  it makes a huge difference  in the lives of the person receiving it. The project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers. For some of them, it's given them a connection  to something bigger, giving something back,  using their talents on something  other than skinny models and perfect skin. I would like to conclude by reading an email  I got from one of them, Cindy,  the day I finally got back from Japan after six months. "As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the individuals  and the stories represented in the images. One in particular, a photo of women of all ages,  from grandmother to little girl, gathered around a baby,  struck a chord, because a similar photo from my family,  my grandmother and mother, myself,  and newborn daughter, hangs on our wall. Across the globe, throughout the ages,  our basic needs are just the same, aren't they?" Thank you. 
with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple,  and exposure just a millionth of a second. But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster  and see the world not at a million or a billion,  but one trillion frames per second. I present to you a new type of photography,  femto-photography,  a new imaging technique so fast  that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion. And with that, we can create cameras that can look around corners,  beyond line of sight,  or see inside our body without an x-ray,  and really challenge what we mean by a camera. Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off  in one trillionth of a second --  which is several femtoseconds --  I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide. And that packet of photons, that bullet,  will travel at the speed of light,  and again, a million times faster than an ordinary bullet. Now, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons  and fire into this bottle,  how will those photons shatter into this bottle? How does light look in slow motion? [Light in Slow Motion ... 10 Billion x Slow] Now, the whole event --    Now remember, the whole event is effectively taking place  in less than a nanosecond --  that's how much time it takes for light to travel. But I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion,  so you can see the light in motion. But Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research.   Now, there's a lot going on in this movie,  so let me break this down and show you what's going on. So the pulse enters the bottle, our bullet,  with a packet of photons that start traveling through  and that start scattering inside. Some of the light leaks, goes on the table,  and you start seeing these ripples of waves. Many of the photons eventually reach the cap  and then they explode in various directions. As you can see, there's a bubble of air  and it's bouncing around inside. Meanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table,  and because of the reflections at the top,  you see at the back of the bottle, after several frames,  the reflections are focused. Now, if you take an ordinary bullet  and let it go the same distance and slow down the video --  again, by a factor of 10 billion --  do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie? A day, a week? Actually, a whole year. It'll be a very boring movie --   of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion. And what about some still-life photography? You can watch the ripples, again, washing over the table,  the tomato and the wall in the back. It's like throwing a stone in a pond of water. I thought: this is how nature paints a photo,  one femto frame at a time,  but of course our eye sees an integral composite. But if you look at this tomato one more time,  you will notice, as the light washes over the tomato,  it continues to glow. It doesn't become dark. Why is that? Because the tomato is actually ripe,  and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato,  and it comes out after several trillionths of a second. So in the future, when this femto-camera is in your camera phone,  you might be able to go to a supermarket  and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it. So how did my team at MIT create this camera? Now, as photographers, you know,  if you take a short exposure photo, you get very little light. But we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure,  so you're going to get hardly any light. So what we do is we send that bullet --  that packet of photons -- millions of times,  and record again and again with very clever synchronization,  and from the gigabytes of data,  we computationally weave together  to create those femto-videos I showed you. And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways. So, Superman can fly. Some other heroes can become invisible. But what about a new power for a future superhero:  To see around corners. The idea is that we could shine some light on the door,  it's going to bounce, go inside the room,  some of that is going to reflect back on the door,  and then back to the camera. And we could exploit these multiple bounces of light. And it's not science fiction. We have actually built it. On the left, you see our femto-camera. There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall,  and we're going to bounce light off the door. So after our paper was published in Nature Communications,  it was highlighted by Nature.com,  and they created this animation. Ramesh Raskar: We're going to fire those bullets of light,  and they're going to hit this wall,  and because of the packet of the photons,  they will scatter in all the directions,  and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin,  which in turn will again scatter that light,  and again in turn, the door will reflect some of that scattered light. And a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera,  but most interestingly,  they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot. And because we have a camera that can run so fast --  our femto-camera -- it has some unique abilities. It has very good time resolution,  and it can look at the world at the speed of light. And this way, we know the distances, of course to the door,  but also to the hidden objects,  but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance. By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo,  which, if you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense. But then we will take a lot of such pictures,  dozens of such pictures, put them together,  and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light,  and from that, can we see the hidden object? Can we see it in full 3D? So this is our reconstruction. Now, we have some ways to go  before we take this outside the lab on the road,  but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the bend. Or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions  by looking at light reflected through open windows. Or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders,  and also for cardioscopes. But of course, because of tissue and blood,  this is quite challenging,  so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about femto-photography  as really a new imaging modality  to solve the next generation of health-imaging problems. Now, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist himself,  science became art -- an art of ultra-fast photography. And I realized  that all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time,  are not just for scientific imaging. But we can also do a new form of computational photography,  with time-lapse and color coding. And we look at those ripples. Remember:  The time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second. But there's also something funny going on here. When you look at the ripples under the cap,  the ripples are moving away from us. The ripples should be moving towards us. What's going on here? It turns out, because we're recording nearly at the speed of light,  we have strange effects,  and Einstein would have loved to see this picture. The order at which events take place in the world  appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order. So by applying the corresponding space and time warp,  we can correct for this distortion. So whether it's for photography around corners,  or creating the next generation of health imaging,  or creating new visualizations,  since our invention,  we have open-sourced all the data and details on our website,  and our hope is that the DIY, the creative and the research communities  will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras --   and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging. It's about time. Thank you. 
Hi. This is my mobile phone. A mobile phone can change your life,  and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom. With a mobile phone,  you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria. With a mobile phone,  you can tweet a message  and start a protest in Egypt. And with a mobile phone,  you can record a song, load it up to  SoundCloud and become famous. All this is possible with your mobile phone. I'm a child of 1984,  and I live in the city of Berlin. Let's go back to that time, to this city. Here you can see  how hundreds of thousands of people  stood up and protested for change. This is autumn 1989,  and imagine that all those people standing up  and protesting for change had a  mobile phone in their pocket. Who in the room has a mobile phone with you? Hold it up. Hold your phones up, hold your phones up! Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow. That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone. But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone,  and how it changed my life. And I will talk about this. These are 35,830 lines of information. Raw data. And why are these informations there? Because in the summer of 2006,  the E.U. Commission tabled a directive. This directive [is] called Data Retention Directive. This directive says that each phone company in Europe,  each Internet service company all over Europe,  has to store a wide range of information about the users. Who calls whom? Who sends whom an email? Who sends whom a text message? And if you use your mobile phone, where you are. All this information is stored for at least six months,  up to two years by your phone company  or your Internet service provider. And all over Europe, people stood up and said,  "We don't want this." They said, we don't want this data retention. We want self-determination in the digital age,  and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies  have to store all this information about us. They were lawyers, journalists, priests,  they all said: "We don't want this." And here you can see, like 10 thousands of people  went out on the streets of Berlin and said,  "Freedom, not fear." And some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0. Stasi was the secret police in East Germany. And I also ask myself, does it really work? Can they really store all this information about us? Every time I use my mobile phone? So I asked my phone company, Deutsche Telekom,  which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany,  and I asked them, please,  send me all the information you have stored about me. And I asked them once, and I asked them again,  and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers. But then I said, I want to have this information,  because this is my life you are protocoling. So I decided to start a lawsuit against them,  because I wanted to have this information. But Deutsche Telekom said, no,  we will not give you this information. So at the end, I had a settlement with them. I'll put down the lawsuit  and they will send me all the information I ask for. Because in the mean time,  the German Constitutional Court ruled  that the implementation of this E.U. directive  into German law was unconstitutional. So I got this ugly brown envelope  with a C.D. inside. And on the C.D., this was on. Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information. At first I saw it, and I said, okay,  it's a huge file. Okay. But then after a while I realized,  this is my life. This is six months of my life,  into this file. So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it? Because you can see where I am,  where I sleep at night,  what I am doing. But then I said, I want to go out with this information. I want to make them public. Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean. So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City, I did this. This is a visualization of six months of my life. You can zoom in and zoom out,  you can wind back and fast forward. You can see every step I take. And you can even see  how I go from Frankfurt by train  to Cologne, and how often I call in between. All this is possible with this information. That's a little bit scary. But it is not only about me. It's about all of us. First, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me,  and we talk to each other a couple of times. And then there are some friends calling me,  and they call each other. And after a while you are calling you,  and you are calling you, and you have this great  communication network. But you can see how your people are communicating with each other,  what times they call each other, when they go to bed. You can see all of this. You can see the hubs, like who are the leaders in the group. If you have access to this information,  you can see what your society is doing. If you have access to this information,  you can control your society. This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran. This is a blueprint how to survey your society,  because you know who talks to whom,  who sends whom an email, all this is possible  if you have access to this information. And this information is stored for at least six months  in Europe, up to two years. Like I said at the beginning,  imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin  in autumn of 1989  had a mobile phone in their pocket. And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest,  and if the Stasi would have known  who are the leaders behind it,  this may never have happened. The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [have been] there. And in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain. Because today, state agencies and companies  want to store as much information as they can get about us,  online and offline. They want to have the possibility to track our lives,  and they want to store them for all time. But self-determination and living in the digital age  is no contradiction. But you have to fight for your self-determination today. You have to fight for it every day. So, when you go home,  tell your friends  that privacy is a value of the 21st century,  and it's not outdated. When you go home, tell your representative  only because companies and state agencies have the possibility  to store certain information, they don't have to do it. And if you don't believe me,  ask your phone company what information they store about you. So, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone,  let it be a reminder to you  that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age. Thank you.
