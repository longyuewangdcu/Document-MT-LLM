The wind blows through the canyon and stirs up waves on the plain.
The wild bull, which was grazing on tender grass leaves, raised its head and looked towards the sky.
There, a wooden merchant ship several tens of meters long was hovering in the air, its full sails bulging from the wind, slowly moving forward.
"No matter when I look, this wind current is always so magnificent."
The middle-aged man dressed in leather armor stands beside the deck, looking down at the vast plain and the beautiful scenery.
"For us merchants, this is also a rare business opportunity."
Standing beside the middle-aged man is a slightly plump merchant with a strange head of curly hair and dressed in a merchant's long robe. His two small eyes are slightly squinted, as if he is calculating something as he watches the scenery in front of him. From his appearance, it seems that even the beautiful scenery in front of him can be sold for money.
"Without it, I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to transport goods into the central area so quickly."
"To be honest, when I first planned to expand this market, I was opposed, but now it looks like my choice was indeed correct."
"But excuse me for speaking frankly, you did not choose the large waterways, instead you went from here, although it will save time, but the degree of danger will also increase."
"I heard that the other side is not peaceful lately. And I think the captain has also warned you that there seem to be wind serpents around here recently. What if...?"
The man's face became somewhat solemn, he turned his head and cast his gaze toward the mountains not far away.
"The towering peaks blocking his sight, he couldn't see what was beyond."
But faintly, it can be seen that the sky in the distance is not purely blue, but with a touch of dark darkness.
"That is not the world they should venture into."
"Don't worry, there's no such thing as too many "what ifs". Fortune favors the bold, that's why I spent so much money to hire you all!"
"Just a few snakes, right?"
The merchant reached out and patted the man's shoulder.
"By the way, how is the young man we rescued now?"
Not dead yet."
"Lijie has already treated his wounds and he's now in a deep sleep, there should be no danger to his life."
"That's good."
Upon hearing the man's reply, the merchant nodded contentedly, but soon thereafter he quickly furrowed his brow.
"But what injury did that young man receive? The wound looks like it was caused by a large reptile, but do such strange creatures exist in the northern part of Pasfield?"
"I'm not sure, sir. But it must be a very ferocious beast. I hope we don't run into them."
As he spoke, the man unconsciously glanced towards the entrance of the cabin, and then turned his gaze forward.
Rod opened his eyes.
What happened?
He stared at the ceiling in front of him, his mind hazy and groggy.
He remembered that he should have been leading the team on the ruins platform and fighting against the strongest boss, the Void Dragon, in the Dragon Soul continent. He successfully got the first kill and was sure that he received the achievement and system prompt. But then, the Void Dragon's final strike also took his life.
According to the original plan, Rod should have been resurrected from the graveyard and then logged out.
But just as he was killed by the Void Dragon, the entire world suddenly turned black, as if it was forcibly isolated. Then, Rod lost consciousness.
How is this possible?
Could it be that there's a problem with the game?
Rod turned his head with difficulty, and through the window he saw the blue sky and white clouds outside. Where is he?
What is this place?
What exactly happened?
Is he still dreaming?
Or are you still in the game?
At least Rod can be sure that this place is definitely not his own small rental apartment.
When he thought of this, he immediately felt puzzled. He frowned and then tried to sit up.
Whoa!!!
At this moment, a huge pain suddenly came from Rod's chest. He clenched his teeth and stopped.
At this time, Rod found that his left shoulder and chest were completely covered by bandages. Although he did not know what had happened, he was obviously injured from the bloodstains that were infiltrating on it.
This is definitely not a game!
Rod can be sure of this. Although the technology is quite developed now, the Dragon Soul Land, as the first virtual all-around online game in the world, also uses a lot of high-tech technology. However, according to the rules, it is impossible for players to experience pain. This is to make people distinguish reality from the game, and also consider lowering the threshold of players.
When the player is injured, instead of pain, the game will use a series of ways to warn and remind the player, such as reducing the player's movement speed and covering the sight with red, which represents danger, to interfere with the player's normal game, rather than actually simulating the pain.
This behavior caused considerable debate in society when the holographic simulation technology first appeared, and the operating company of Dragon Soul Continent naturally knew about it.
Rode lowers his head and focuses on his right hand, which is not the character he created in the game, not the body full of muscles and wildness.
Instead, the hand in front of him is slender and weak, and the skin is pale and unhealthy due to the lack of exposure to the sun for a long time.
This is his body in reality, and he is very aware of it.
But how could he be hurt?
And, this doesn't look like a hospital either?
Rode looks up and sees that the whole room seems to be a cabin, with no lights, no phone, and no call bell.
A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed on the wall are all the possessions here.
For some reason, Rode feels like he has seen this scene somewhere before.
Just as Rode was studying the room carefully, the door suddenly opened.
A blond girl in a white robe walked into the room and looked at Rod who was half sitting up, her eyes widening in surprise.
"You're awake? That's great!!"
The girl was speaking a language that was neither Chinese nor English, but Rod was able to understand her clearly.
This surprised Rod and he realized that he knew the language.
This was Nym language, one of the official languages of the Dragon Soul Continent!
"How do you feel? Are you okay?"
But the girl didn't pay attention to Rod's expression. She quickly walked to his side and carefully checked his left shoulder and chest.
"Your injury is really serious. To be honest, I was a little worried that you wouldn't be able to make it..."
"This is..."
Rod frowned, not knowing what to say. He turned his head and looked at the mirror on the wall beside him. His face was clearly reflected there, and it was indeed his face, but it shouldn't have been here.
"Have you forgotten?"
The blond girl blinked her eyes in confusion and her pigtails swayed slightly with her movement. Her blue eyes were clear and transparent, giving off a lively feeling.
"Two days ago, you collapsed in the Pfalz Mountains and sustained serious injuries."
"If it weren't for the cargo ship from the 'Silver Mandala' trade guild passing by, it could have been quite dire."
"I really don't know what you're fighting against. Your left side has suffered serious injuries and it was really dangerous at that time."
"Wait, left shoulder?"
"Rhod was taken aback and immediately realized that it was his left side that was attacked during the final battle against the Dragon of the Void."
"But that was just a character he was playing in the game and it shouldn't have affected the player himself. However, now it was the player himself who was injured?"
"Despite the chaos in front of him, Rod quickly regained his composure, which was a testament to his mental toughness as a top player and the leader of the world's strongest online gaming guild."
"Through his conversation with the golden-haired girl in front of him, Rod also learned about his current situation. He was severely injured and lying on the Plains of Pafield, but the airship of the Silver Horizon Merchant Guild happened to pass by and rescued him."
According to the golden-haired girl, Rod's initial condition was not optimistic, but his recovery ability was quite good.
"My name is Leije. Noire, a member of the Star Moon Mercenaries, a spiritualist. Just call me Leije."
The girl introduced herself to Rod in a straightforward manner.
"My name is Rod. Alante."
Although he still could not sort out the situation at hand, Rod hesitated briefly before reporting his in-game identity and ID.
"From the Eastern Mountain Plains, I am an adventurer."
"Ah, so you're an adventurer, that's why you were all alone in such a faraway, remote mountain."
Lijie heard Rod's answer and was not surprised, as there are many adventurers on this continent who like to explore alone, so Rod's identity as an adventurer is not a big problem.
"But what were you actually fighting against?"
"Why were you so badly hurt?"
"I remember in this plain area, there shouldn't be any particularly scary monsters, right?"
Hearing the girl's question, Roderick chuckled awkwardly.
What could he say? Could he tell Lijie that he was injured while fighting against one of the Five Dragons of Creation, the Void Dragon?
"I was attacked at night, so I didn't see clearly what the attacker was. There were many of them and they were fast. I think maybe it was something from 'over there'."
"I understand."
Although Rod didn't explain in detail, Li Jie seemed to understand and nodded. Then she carefully checked Rod's wound before standing up.
"You haven't eaten for two days, I imagine you must be quite hungry. Please wait, I'll go get something to eat right away."
"Ah, right, I also need to report this to the leader, I think he will come to see you soon."
Having said that, the girl politely nodded to Rod and then turned and left the room.
