"Are you in the East campus?"
Zhou Tu hesitated for a moment, both seniors and teachers had warned the new students not to approach the East campus. They did not explain the specific reason, but their tone of speech indicated that the East campus was very dangerous.
"You have a deep misunderstanding of the East campus. It's actually the same as here, but the two campus management is completely different. They live in a real terror, while you live in a false happiness."
Chen Ge looked into Zhou Tu's eyes, "Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope, because they at least know who they are, and know the way to be saved."
Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu, whether it was the students from the East or West campus, they were all trapped in this school.
The memories of the West campus students were modified, repeating the lives made by the dark hands behind the scenes, while the students from the East campus at least knew how to look for a substitute ghost and find a way to leave.
"The students from the East school are closer to hope?"
"But I heard only the garbage from the West campus will be sent there."
Zhou Tu was moved, but still a little unsteady.
"No matter what the standards of judgment are, any school that treats students as garbage is definitely a garbage school."
Chen Ge pointed to the tall fence between the two campuses: "Do you know why that wall exists?"
"Why?"
"Because the school is afraid of losing control, they try to reshape human nature in various ways, but they forget that human nature is the most complex thing in the world."
"Things have happened, no matter how to forget, the wounds will always be imprinted on the heart."
"Not remembering doesn't mean they don't exist, so certain plans in this school are doomed to fail."
Chen Ge said some things that the club members didn't understand, they didn't know why Chen Ge said that, but they felt that what Chen Ge said made some sense.
The curiosity of children is heavy in itself, and Chen Ge continues to tell them the truth about this school, finally successfully arousing the interest of the club members.
"Then can we go there now?"
"To be honest, I really don't believe that there will be a painting studio in my dream in the east campus." Zhou Tu whispered.
"Now is not the time."
Chen Ge turned and glanced at his shadow. The black shadow in room 413 was still sleeping, but his body had changed significantly.
If you look closely, you'll find that Chen Ge's shadow is different from others. It's as dark as ink, as if all light that reaches it will be devoured.
It seems to have gotten much stronger.
The huge potential of the black shadow is a good thing for Chen Ge. When he wakes up, Chen Ge will lead the students back to the east campus to find the straggling ghosts and take action.
Doing this not only enhances his own strength, but also stirs up the stagnant waters in the school, covering up another "killer" in the college.
"It's still a stage of accumulating strength. Before the master of the school finds out about me, this little worm, I want to prepare as many aces for myself as possible."
Chen Ge turned his head to look at Wang Yicheng. He already knew the stories of the other three club members, and only the story of the first boy with a limp was left: "The next place we're going to is Wang Yicheng's dormitory."
"Go to my dormitory?"
Wang Yicheng reacted strangely after hearing this. He waved his hand repeatedly, "Forget it, there's nothing worth seeing in the dormitory I live in."
"When you say this, your voice is higher than usual, your speech speed is faster, your eyes are flitting, and you're not good at lying, kid."
Chen Ge gently hugged Wang Yicheng's shoulder: "Why don't you want to let us go?"
"Are you worried about what we'll see?"
"I..."
Wang Yicheng thought for a long time and didn't know what to say, finally his gaze turned to another direction: "Nothing, let's go straight there."
"Okay."
Wang Yicheng lives in dormitory 413 in the West Campus, and Lin Sisi lives in dormitory 413 in the East Campus.
The dormitory numbers are exactly the same, but except for bed number four, there are students in all the other beds in dormitory 413 in the West Campus, while it's the opposite in the East Campus, where only bed number four is occupied and all the other beds are empty.
"Don't tell the secrets of our club to others, try to be low-key, there are teachers like me in this school, and there are also teachers who are not easy to talk to."
Chen Ge remains vigilant, the noise they made in the experimental building was too loud, the school authorities may have already started to investigate.
"The time I have left is not much, after seeing dormitory 413, we have to avoid the wind first."
The West campus male dormitory building has four buildings in total, and the number of students is several times that of the East campus. Now it is not yet time to turn off the lights, and it is the most lively time for the male dormitory building. The sound of washing, the sound of plastic basin falling, and the sound of conversation can be clearly heard from the downstairs.
"This building is similar to the East campus."
Chen Ge showed great naturalness and followed four students into the first building. 
The small house where the dormitory manager lived was closed, but the glass window was open, and a fifty-something woman was humming inside, looking happy.
Next to the small window is a notice that reads "Prohibited use of high-power electrical appliances in the dormitory, prohibited cooking in the dormitory".
"I remember that what was written on the East campus dormitory notice was- Recently there have been malicious cases, students are prohibited from going out after lights out."
Separated by a wall, it is almost two worlds, like "inside" and "outside" the door. 
Through the corridor, Chen Ge and several club members came to the door of 413 dormitory.
"This dormitory is no different from other dormitories."
Wang Yicheng opened the door, and after he entered the room, the other people in the dormitory seemed to ignore him, doing their own things, and no one talked to him.
After Wang Yicheng walked a few steps inside, the man sleeping on the bed next to the door suddenly threw open the mosquito net and glared at him: "How many times have I said it?"
"Come in and close the door, are your legs lame and your ears not working?"
The man spoke harshly and he didn't know why he seemed to dislike Wang Yicheng.
"He didn't close the door because someone else is coming in. If you need an apology, we can apologize on his behalf. We just don't know what kind of apology you need?"
Chen Ge held onto the door handle and looked around the room.
When the mosquito net man saw Chen Ge, he immediately lost his courage and didn't speak. He pulled the mosquito net back down with a dark face.
"Mr. Bai, this is bed number four. Since no one is living here, we use it to put our luggage."
Wang Yicheng pointed to bed number four, which was covered with several luggage boxes. Only his luggage was stored under his own bed, while everyone else had thrown their miscellaneous items and luggage on bed number four.
Chen Ge is familiar with bed number four. He himself has lain on bed number four in the east campus.
Walking to bed number four, although no one was living there, the bed was equipped with a quilt and sheets. However, those bedding items are now dirty with luggage and miscellaneous items.
