"Rosefinch."
In the bamboo house, Bai Yan was looking at Bai Xiaochen and Bruce Lee, who were playing and fighting. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise coming from outside. Her eyebrows frowned: "What's going on outside? Why is there noise?"
Go out and have a look.
The rosefinch arched her fist and took the order to step back. After half a ring, she opened the door of the bamboo house and walked in. She hesitated and said, "Queen, there are two people outside, who are looking for you..."
Looking for me?
Bai Yan raised his eyebrows, "I'll go out and see who is looking for me."
After that, she stood up slowly from her chair and walked towards the door.
Outside the house, under the bloody sky, the two men climbed from the front, trembling and trembling. Maybe the way they climbed was too many, which led to a blood mark flowing under their bodies and fell into Bai Yan's eyes, which was particularly glaring.
What are you doing?
Bai Yan frowned and asked coldly.
The second elder was pale, trembling and prostrate on the ground, and said, "Queen, I came to apologize to you. On that day, it was because I trusted the fake that the queen misunderstood the king. Everything was my fault. I am willing to fight and scold at will, and ask the queen to apologize."
No, queen, it's my fault. I didn't bring the king's order to you. In fact, the king left the palace to remove the seal of the demon world that day. He asked me to come back and inform the queen that I didn't do it, which gave the opportunity to the traitors.
Huoyu knelt down on the ground with tears on his face: "It's my fault to make thousands of mistakes. The queen wants to fight and scold, but I can't say anything." He took the bamboo strip behind him in his hand, held it with his palms, and handed it to Bai Yan. He lowered his head deeply, and looked at death with his face.
Bai Yan's hand slowly grasped the bamboo strip dragged by the fire plume in front of her. Her face was calm and her eyes were full of incomprehensible light.
It seems to be aware that the bamboo bar is out of hand, and the body of Huoyu is frozen. He tightly bites his teeth, waiting for the overwhelming blow.
But...
For a long time, there was no pain.
Huoyu looked up in astonishment, but saw a burst of flames from the bamboo strips in Bai Yan's hand, which burned into ashes in an instant.
You have suffered a lot from climbing all the way?
The king... the queen?
Huo Yu looks at Bai Yan without knowing why. Maybe he doesn't understand what she said.
In that case, your sin has been paid. Get up.
Bai Yan has always been a clear person in the company. She only targets those who want to harm her.
On that day, she could be deceived, not to mention Big Elder and Huoyu? So she never complained about them
Huoyu's body is as stiff as iron. Can't believe Bai Yan let them go so easily?
Before coming, they were ready to be bruised all over!
Now, she has eliminated their sin without even smoking them.
Seeing the two men kneeling on the ground and not moving, Bai Yan's face sank slightly: "Why?"
Are you still waiting for me to help you up?
The woman's harsh voice fell into the ears of Huoyu, who was so shocked that he immediately climbed up from the ground. His pants legs were covered with blood, and he could not stand still.
Even so, he still stood on the ground, even though his legs and feet were shaking, he did not continue to kneel down.
Bai Yan looked at both of them and pointed to the stone block on the ground. "Sit down, take a rest and you can go down the mountain."
