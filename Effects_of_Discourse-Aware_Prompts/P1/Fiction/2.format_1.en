Under the suppression of the artillery, the base was in chaos and no one noticed a special forces team sneaking into the camp.
With little effort, Kutebov placed the beacon on the designated target and then evacuated the base with his team, safely reaching the evacuation point and calling in the air strike.
Soon, Russian stealth bombers roared past above the clouds and dropped four bombs accurately hitting two ammunition depots and two fuel depots within the base.
The explosion shock wave swept across the entire camp, directly collapsing the concrete buildings around it.
The martyred ammunition and burning fire flew across the camp, causing a series of chain reactions. There were flames everywhere, blood and corpses everywhere
The guards stationed inside the camp nearly lost half of their strength and most of the survivors were injured. It was almost impossible to find a complete person.
Medical soldiers carried stretchers and walked through the base, searching for wounded who had lost mobility.
The sappers, wearing heavy bomb-proof clothing, brave death and rush into the fire scene to drag out unexploded ammunition from the ruins.
The soldiers who could still move all got up and searched for their troops to regroup.
Sardes gazed at the firelight outside the window, and a layer of despair gradually imprinted in his stagnant pupils.
Thick smoke covered the entire base, the firelight turned the whole night sky red, it was just like the end of the world.
"shit......"
He muttered to himself and slowly moved his legs, as if they were filled with lead, and gradually left the window.
Turning around, he locked eyes with the chief of staff from headquarters.
"Commander, what should we do?"
The aftermath of the explosion finally subsided, and there was no longer the sound of exploding ammunition in the base. However, everyone's mood couldn't calm down. Mercenaries who escaped from the explosion knew that what lay ahead was just the beginning of their nightmare.
The previous explosion seemed to ignite some sort of signal and sounded the horn for the Sarmy offensive.
Under Jiang Chen's orders, Sarmy seized this fleeting opportunity, stood in front of everyone and shouted, leading the remaining militants to the front line.
Over six thousand people ran across the moor and charged towards the pine forest where the firelight flickered.
From a distance, the scene was quite spectacular.
At the same time, all the mercenaries fighting on the front line were plunged into panic as they looked at the thick smoke rising from the base behind them, and their previously high morale plummeted to the bottom in an instant.
When faced with a tidal wave of violent mobs, even if they have the strength to steady the defense line, they have no heart to fight on.
Without any suspense, Arrow Corporation's defenses were breached, and the stubborn mercenaries were defeated in the face of the Sami Army's human wave tactics.
Some people fled back to the burning base, but most of them became deserters and fled to the depths of the forest.
It doesn't need to be reminded by Jiang Chen. Even a pig should know what to do at this time.
Watching Sami and the mob begin to attack the military base, Jiang Chen collected his telescope, summoned a prepared off-road motorcycle from the storage space, and patted Aisha on the back.
"Almost. Let's go, too."
"Hmm!"
Aisha nodded and, after Jiang Chen sat on the motorcycle, nimbly straddled behind him.
"The engine roared, and the tires kicked up a layer of broken snow."
Riding his all-terrain motorcycle, Jiang Chen charged down the hill with Aisha, circled around to the side of the base, stopped the motorcycle by the side of the road, took out the laser sword from the storage space, swung it a couple of times with ease, and easily cut through the protective wall woven with steel wire.
The entire base was immersed in fire and chaos, and the sound of mortar fire could be heard from time to time. All the armed mercenaries were on the front line, fighting for control of the main gate of the base with the mobs.
Besides a guard team standing in front of the command center, no one could be seen in the entire rear.
For Jiang Chen and Aisha, this was no different from being unguarded.
There were a total of ten guards, two standing on the watchtower, and the remaining eight standing at the entrances of the first and second floors.
Aisha took out the ghost sniper rifle and quietly took care of the two guards standing on the watchtower. Then, using the dead angle of her vision, she took out one by one the eight people upstairs and downstairs.
After Aisha took care of the guards outside the command center, Jiang Chen took out his rifle and walked towards the entrance. Just as he passed by the muscle car at the entrance, he stumbled upon Saldes and the command center's chief of staff who were fleeing from the command center in a rush.
Upon making eye contact, both parties obviously paused for a moment.
The advisor was the first to react, immediately reaching into his chest to pull out his gun, but before he could touch his chest, he was shot in the head by the quicker-reacting Aisha.
Sardes was about to resist, but he was easily controlled by Jiang Chen and was forced to press his hands against the side of the muscle car.
"Sardes, male, 43 years old."
"Sardes, male, 43 years old. The CEO of Arrow Corporation and also the supreme commander, am I correct?"
Although it was their first time meeting, Jiang Chen was wearing a holographic helmet connected to the Ghost Agent database that contained his picture and personal information.
Just from one meeting, information about him was projected on the holographic screen.
With his face pressed against the hood of the car, Saludes gritted his teeth and refused to surrender, despite his tough demeanor.
"I won't say anything, just kill me..."
"Kill you?"
"I haven't asked you anything yet."
Jiang Chen smirked and didn't pay attention to his uncooperative attitude. He made room with his right hand and took out a needle tube, unceremoniously sticking it into his back shoulder.
"Ugh!"
"A resisting howl came from the throat, Salters roundly glared with blood-streaked eyes, but soon the spirit in the pupils faded away."
Jiang Chen simply loosened his grip on his captive and calmly said, "Normal people can resist after being injected with truth serum, but that is simply not the case."
Jiang Chen flipped Salads over and asked in a measured tone.
"Where is Carmen?"
"In the research institute of the underground bunker."
"Where is the underground shelter?"
"The entrance is in the center of the base and can only be accessed by an elevator."
"There are two landing strips next to the entrance, you can see them when you go there."
Quickly, Jiang Chen got the information he wanted through a series of questions and answers.
"Good, now you can have what you want."
"Jiang Chen pulled out his gun and fired a shot at his head, then threw his body to the side."
This is a quite speedy death, but for Mr. Thorne, the renowned CEO of Arrow Inc., dying in this quiet and unheard manner may be more painful than death itself... if the dead can feel pain.
"Underground bunker."
Looking in the direction of the center of the base, Jiang Chen's mouth triggered a sneer.
No matter what Carmen is still scheming, his good fortune should end.
The fate of the House of Lancaster will be as it began: with a cry of war, and with a whisper of peace... as they die unheard in battle.
At this moment, however, there was a shrill scream in the distance.
