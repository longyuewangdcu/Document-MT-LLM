Xiao Mo felt a moment of agitation, his heart and mind both stirred, and he felt a deep sadness
The master must not dare to move
Once his body moves, his mind will start to work as well. How could he be so intelligent and not know that Bai Weiwei has already died?
He didn't want to admit it and didn't dare to think deeply, so he forced himself to just sit there and convince himself that Bai Weiwei was only sleeping and would wake up.
Xiao Mo felt that it was only when Bai Weiwei's body began to decompose that the master would truly regain his senses and realize that the person he was holding hands with had been dead for a long time.
But strangely, Bai Weiwei's body showed no signs of change.
Her pale face even looked better, and although her body was cold, she appeared to be sleeping without a doubt.
There were no signs of any characteristics of a corpse.
Mo Yanjun guarded her, his eyes growing brighter.
The terrible old physician was finally brought in. He ate a heart-protecting pill and said, "I guess half of my old life is gone.
Mo Yanjun hasn't slept for five days, and everyone could see that his body was extremely tired.
But he was surprisingly clear-headed, clear-headed in a scary and abnormal way.
After I gave her the medicine, she fell asleep like this. I think I should ask you to come and take a look, when will she wake up?
The old man sighed and walked to the bedside, feeling the pulse of White Weiwei.
"What's that?" asked Muyun Lord, his gaze fixed on the old man. The old man looked at him seriously and said, "She needs to be buried properly, or her soul will be trapped in this world and never find peace." Muyun Lord nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation.
Muyanjun was listening intently, like a good student, his eyes burning like a fire.
The old man's voice dropped lower, "I have to heal another person again..."
Muyan Jun leaned forward, not wanting to miss a word of what he had to say.
The old man's technique was like electricity, and he instantly poked a needle into his neck.
Muyan Jun's eyes suddenly opened wide and his hand struck towards the old man's temple.
Xiaomo's hand shot out and caught Mu Yanjun's attack.
Muyan Jun's eyes suddenly opened wide, and his hand was already striking towards the top of the old man's head. But Xiaomo's hand appeared out of nowhere, grabbing Muyan Jun's attack. The back-and-forth caused Muyan Jun to eventually collapse and pass out from dizziness.
The old man rubbed his head, "Almost died, but I guess I won't live much longer. It's good if he wakes up without going crazy."
White Wei Wei is beyond saving.
"The situation of Mo Yanchun is simply heartbreaking, with problems arising in all internal organs."
Not eating, not sleeping, not thinking, not moving, just like a dead person. If he lasts for another two days, he's likely to be gone just like Bai Weiwei.
Xiao Mo looked at the old man and said, "You're responsible for keeping my family's leader alive. If you fail this time, I'll kill you myself."
With that, she turned and walked towards the place where they were going to be punished, silently accepting her punishment.
The old man sighed, "No wonder my master said that even selling sweet potatoes can't be a divine physician. Everyone thinks I'm a god, but even a god can't make a person who wants to die live."
Muyanjun only slept for two hours, but his eyes opened.
Mo Yanjun's eyes suddenly opened after only sleeping for two hours. He was shocked to find that he was unable to move, and his eyes showed a rare panic.
Zao Laotou saw that he had awakened and said, "Let me give you an acupuncture needle. Your spirit is declining, but if I take care of you, you should go see King Yan."
Mu Yanjun's eyes were gloomy, his face was pale and haggard, but he was full of evil spirit, which made people shudder.
"But then again," the old man sighed, "I don't want to bear the guilt of letting a life go to waste, even if the person is as cruel and vicious as you are. So I'll do what I can to keep you alive." He then gave Muy√°n another shot.
Mu Yanjun's voice was soft and strange, "Release me."
The bad old man shook his head, "This is no good. I can't save your heart. Saving you is compensation."
Mu Yanjun suddenly laughed bitterly, "You can't pay it. How can you pay it? Even if you save everyone in the world, you can't pay her a hair."
