After carefully looking at the house, he was sure that there were no major problems, so he basically settled the matter. Nanfeng will discuss the rest with the real estate agent and the original owner.
Curly is in a very good mood today, and he had a great time going out to have fun.
After swimming in the sea and being called ashore by Fang Zhao, he even planed the sand for a while to play, and when he left, the dog kept staring out the car window, full of reluctance.
Seeing this, Nanfeng smiled and said: "Don't worry about Curly, you can live in it when you come next time. Then you can play as long as you want, and you can go swimming in the sea every day, and there are small fish and shrimps to play with~"
Curly was happy, lying in the car and began to fantasize about a happy life in the future.
What is Curly's impression of the ocean?
The impression that you don't need money to eat seafood buffet.
Its cheerful mood lasted until it returned to the dormitory for advanced students.
After Nanfeng and the others left, Fang Zhao closed the door of the dormitory, "Curly hair, come here."
Curly miso miso miso whistling its tail and leaned over.
Have a good time today?
Fang Zhao asked.
Wow!
Isn't it fun over there?
Fang Zhao asked again.
The curly hair jumped up and made another "woof", and flicked its tail very vigorously.
say.
Fun!
Curly Road.
It is now able to switch languages proficiently, and the pronunciation standard is also smooth.
Um.
Fang Zhao nodded, and then turned on the learning machine.
Curly: "..."
His ears twitched, his paws retracted, and he took a step back thinking he was hiding.
Fang Zhao ignored its flinching, turned on the learning machine, and showed it a newly created folder, which contained the e-books he had just purchased——
Marine Environmental Protection Law
Youth Environmental Protection Knowledge Series
Marine Wildlife Protection List
Marine Environmental Management
One Hundred Ocean Knowledges That People in the New Century Must Know
The Sea, My Home
All are books related to the ocean, a total of twenty books.
There are not only e-books, but also supporting test questions, 20 sets.
Curly: "..."
<Its _Pa's excited ears drop.
I know you read fast, should you be faster now?
After reading the 20 books in the folder, and getting full marks for the corresponding 20 sets of test questions, I will let you play in the sea.
It is estimated that there will be no more than fifteen days before moving in. Fang Zhao said.
It's all rote knowledge. With Curly's current memory and learning ability, it's not difficult to get full marks.
Fang Zhao was not worried about Curly's safety when it went to the sea. On the contrary, he was worried that Curly would eat some endangered animals in the sea to extinction.
Fang Zhao still doesn't know how big Curly's stomach is.
During the Bu Xing recording program, Curly Hair ate secretly in the desert and in the sea, but because of Fang Zhao's warning, Curly Hair didn't really open his stomach to eat.
After all, he didn't stay in Buxing for a long time, and he was under Fang Zhao's control, and he had to take care of other people in Buxing, so he couldn't steal too much.
But after moving to a new home, Curly has the opportunity to go to the sea every day. If it is not controlled, it will be equivalent to species invasion, breaking the ecological balance of this sea area with the power of a dog.
Fang Zhao had to let Curly Hair understand some things in advance, and the marine life finally recovered to the present level, so Curly Hair can't be destroyed.
If you want to enter the sea without passing the exam, continue to be with the learning machine!
On this day, Nanfeng came to find Fang Zhao because of the renovation of the new house.
As soon as he entered the dormitory, Nanfeng saw curly hair facing the wall, squatting there with the dog's head drooping, and there were tears under the dog's eyes.
There was a pause in the footsteps, Nanfeng looked away, went to find Fang Zhao, and settled the matter at hand first.
As for curly hair, this is the norm, and Nan Feng can already look at it calmly.
After talking about the decoration, Nanfeng remembered what <he> saw today, and said again: "By the way, boss, do you know what happened on the Internet today?"
What's up?
Fang Zhao is writing a thesis today, the communication settings have been set up, and nothing important will disturb him.
During this period of time, there were many topics about him on the Internet, and there were many people looking for him. Fang Zhao could only set the Do Not Disturb mode.
Do you know Will's painting?
Nanfeng asked.
You know, it's about Will's graduation work?
Fang Zhao went to Will's graduation painting exhibition, and it was also a high score of A+. One of the graduation works was curly hair, and the name was "The Neighbor's Dog".
It's been two days since the art exhibition, and Fang Zhao has been writing a thesis in <his> dormitory since this morning, so he really doesn't know what happened on the Internet.
Nanfeng told Fang Zhao what he had learned.
It turned out that after Will's graduation painting exhibition ended, the college displayed his paintings on the school website, which sparked heated discussions.
Will successfully completed the training plan he made last year—the short-term goal of painting Fang Zhao, and the final goal of painting Fang Zhao's dog.
The short-term goal has been accomplished long ago. Will's "My Neighbor" caused heated discussions on the Internet. Some netizens joked that Will painted Fang Zhao like an alien.
This time, after "My Neighbor", "The Neighbor's Dog" was once again on the hot search list of the day.
The Neighbor's Dog is Will's most time-consuming study period, the longest study, the most labor-intensive work, and it is also Will's most satisfying work.
This painting is similar to the style of the previous "My Neighbor", but it looks more difficult to understand. At least "My Neighbor" can still be seen as a human being, but "The Neighbor's Dog" can't be seen as a dog, if not Seeing the name of the painting, no one would think that it is a dog or a small pet dog.
Vibrant color rendering, mysterious and imposing, seems to be too otherworldly, but there is nothing wrong with it, the more you study, the more you will feel a sense of trembling in your heart.
Is Fang Zhao's dog so scary?
After seeing this painting, a student of Huangyi recalled the little poodle he met on campus, and then searched Fang Zhao's dog on the Internet to make sure that he remembered it correctly.
As for Huangyi, those who have heard Fang Zhao's graduation concert and analyzed Will's painting up close have a different feeling.
If I really want to say, this painting gives me the same feeling as Fang Zhao's η"."
It's a bit beyond the scope of ordinary people's understanding.
Even if a layman stands in front of this painting and looks at it quietly for a few seconds, even if he can't understand it, his heart will feel hairy, and his body can't help shivering.
Online, the discussion is even more intense.
I found that after the advanced training, Will was completely free, and his thoughts were free to run, which is beyond my comprehension.
What kind of hatred, what kind of resentment! You actually painted Fang Zhao's dog like this!
The friend in front must have never seen Will's last picture. Let's learn about My Neighbor". First, let's see how Will draws Fang Zhao."
Maybe Will was bitten by a dog and has a psychological shadow on the dog, otherwise it would be impossible to draw such a scary picture!
It's a good little cutie to be painted as a monster!
It's called art!
The artist's world is indeed beyond the comprehension of mere mortals.
No bragging, I stared at the painting for a full five minutes, and I still couldn't understand what he was trying to express, but I just felt so awesome for no reason, and I still had a weird feeling in my heart.
This kind of painting belongs to a deeper level and needs to be studied carefully.
Is this painting not easy to sell?
It's okay to buy it back to ward off evil spirits.
It's still worth investing in. I'm optimistic about Will, a painter. He's still young.
In fact, after Will's paintings were displayed on the school net, someone asked him to buy them.
The last collector from Muzhou bought the painting "The Neighbor's Dog" at a high price, far exceeding Huangyi's estimated price.
Some people think that this Muzhou collector is too fanatical about curly hair, and Muzhou people always seem to be not calm enough when facing curly hair.
Some people think that this is pure hype, either because of Will or because of Fang Zhao's dog. The Shepherd's treatment of dogs is really incomprehensible, as if he has lost his mind.
In response to this, Huangzhou TV's Calligraphy and Painting Channel specially sent someone to interview the person who bought the painting at a high price.
In an interview, the Muzhou collector said: "Many people buy Will's paintings, and they only invest in Will, not the paintings."
I'm different. What I look at is the painting, and of course it's the dog in the painting.
I have a hunch that this painting will be fired for sky-high prices in the future.
Xiao Xiong who saw the live interview: "The Shepherds really have a terrible intuition about dogs."
Humans are indeed strange creatures.
Therefore, because of Will's "Neighbor's Dog" curly hair, it also became a hot search and appeared on the headlines of current affairs news in Huangzhou.
After Nan Feng left, Fang Zhao flipped through the news on the Internet, and said to Curly, "Don't go out these few days, stand for another five minutes and go back to read."
I only got 62 in the test in the morning, and I will read the animal protection part twice more!
Whales are edible!
You can't eat coral either!
