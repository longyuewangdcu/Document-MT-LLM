This is exactly what Song Fu and others wanted to ask, but they were asked first, and they looked at each other and didn't know what to do or how to answer. 
Miao Yi immediately flew to where the loud noise came from, followed by Yan Xiu and the others. 
Song Fu and the others looked at each other and followed along to see what was going on.
When they arrived at the entrance of the mountain, they saw that under the moonlight, the stone tablet with the words "Dong Lai Cave" was broken into pieces. Everyone was shocked that someone had destroyed the entrance to Dong Lai Cave.
Miao Yi suddenly turned around and looked at Song Fu and the others with a fierce expression, sneering, "Good!"
"I just arrived today, and it seems that someone can't wait to give me a show of power!"
"Very good!"
Song Fu and the others were stunned, they understood what the other person meant, but this was definitely not their doing, because they were just sitting together chatting and discussing how to give Miao Yi a hard time when they heard the unusual noise, so they ran out.
At first, they suspected that it was Miao Yi and his people who did it, but seeing Miao Yi's appearance, they felt that Miao Yi didn't have to destroy his own entrance to show his power, after all, Miao Yi is the master of Dong Lai Cave, and it's a shame to have his sign broken as soon as he took office.
This kind of thing must be made clear, otherwise, once it sticks out, they can't bear the responsibility. Song Fu respectfully said, "Master, this is definitely not what we did!"
"Other people followed suit and swore with fists, it seems that it was the first time they treated Miao Yi as the cave master in an official manner.
'Sly argument!'
Miao Yi stared at Song Fuyi and said in a loud voice, 'I just appointed you to guard the mountain gate today, and someone destroyed the mountain gate, how would you not know?'
'Is it not intentional of you to let it go?'
'This...'
Song Fuyi was speechless, he was not here at all, and now it is not easy to say that I don't pay attention to you as the cave master, so I didn't stay, I can only swear to be 'honest' and explain, 'The cave master may not know the situation when he just came, the miscellaneous soldiers from Donglai City have not been sent, I and others have to deal with food and drink by ourselves, for the sake of the stomach, I temporarily left for a while, I did not expect this to happen.'
Wang Zifan and others also swore in succession, 'Cave master, I can prove that Brother Song Fuyi was eating with us just now.'
Miao Yi pointed to the fallen pavilion and said loudly, 'Is it because it fell down by itself? Don't tell me that it was blown down by the wind!'
Song Fuyi was a little speechless and had to raise his hand and say, 'Cave master, I can swear to my predecessors of Lan Yu Men that this is not our doing. If there is a half-truth, let Song Fuyi not die well!'
Miao Yi scanned the crowd with flickering eyes and said in a gloomy voice, 'Is someone coming to my Donglai Cave to cause trouble?'
Everyone was shocked, and it was really possible. They quickly looked around.
"What are you still waiting for here? Do you want to be strangled in your sleep?"
"Quick, spread out and search!"
Miao Yi shouted in anger.
Yan Xiu and the other two first saluted in agreement and quickly spread out into the surrounding mountains and forests.
"Hmm?"
Miao Yi snorted heavily and looked at Song Fu and the others, as if questioning why they weren't searching, and whether they knew something.
At this time, they all had to show that they had nothing to do with themselves and others. Song Fu immediately turned around and shouted, "Follow the cave master's orders and search!"
Everyone saluted Miao Yi and immediately scattered.
However, Song Fu was stopped by Miao Yi, "Song Fu, come with me!"
Song Fu stopped, knelt and followed Miao Yi behind him. 
Just after everyone left, a phantom figure appeared in the same place like a shadow in the water, it was none other than the figure of the incomparable Old White.
Old White gazed at the fallen stone gate and slightly shook his head with a light smile, "The world is like a chess game, how can a brave man only have the bravery of a common man!"
"I've always been worried that you, this kid, are too kind by nature and easily taken advantage of... A man should be bold, but a rough man can hardly reach the sky. Now I am much relieved."
As the words fell, the whole figure wavered like water waves, and disappeared silently in the wave.
In the East Come Hall, the candles and shadows swayed, Song Fu and Miao Yi stood in the hall, one in front and one in back, facing each other. The outside coal has stood up, as if it has noticed something and sneezed.
Miao Yi looked at his own throne expressionlessly, his back facing Song Fu, without a word.
The atmosphere between the two was a bit oppressive. Song Fu waited for a while and finally couldn't help but ask, "What does the cave owner want me for?"
Miao Yi replied in a dark voice, "Song Fu, do you know your crime?"
Song Fu's mouth showed a hint of ridicule, and he glanced at the short table next to him, with a calm voice, "This is not what I did, how can Song Fu have a crime?"
"I am not asking about this!"
Miao Yi suddenly turned around and stared at him, asking coldly word by word, "I ordered you to guard the mountain gate, why did you leave your post? Don't you put my orders as the master of this cave in your eyes!"
Song Fu thought, what do you think?
I never put it in my eyes in the first place.
Of course, he wouldn't say that on the surface, "Song Fu has reported to the master of the cave and he really has no choice but to temporarily leave. I don't want to see such things happen."
Miao Yi asked, "Do you think that if I report this to the lord of the house and the lord of the mountain, they will believe your explanation?"
Song Fu laughed and said, "People have two faces, if the master of the cave wants to falsely accuse me, then please. But the master of the cave shouldn't forget, I also have a mouth to explain, I am not a dumb person."
Miao Yi sneered, "It seems that you are still not regretful!"
As soon as this was said, Yan Xiu, Dan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shao appeared together outside the door and walked in, bowing to Miao Yi, "Master of the cave, we have not found any suspicious person temporarily."
Miao Yi said, "The suspicious person is right in front of your eyes, how come you haven't found it yet!"
Single Table Meaning and Qiu Shaoqun seem to have received a secret signal and quickly shut the gate of the temple.
Song Fu was startled and quickly turned around, but saw the god of death Yan Xiu with a pair of planks and axes coming angrily.
Song Fu quickly drew out his sword, a cold light drawn, quickly trying to defend.
Single Table Meaning and Qiu Shaoqun also quickly stepped forward with their guns, attacking Song Fu together.
Yan Xiu and Song Fu's repair is almost the same, the two people were already evenly matched, and with the help of Single Table Meaning and Qiu Shaoqun, Song Fu's situation suddenly became precarious.
"Shameless thief!"
"How dare you plot against..."
Surrounded, unable to escape, struggling to wield a sword with Yan Xiu, Song Fu's roar of anger has not yet finished shouting, and was pierced by two guns that stabbed desperately, piercing through his magic defense, ruthlessly piercing into his chest.
Song Fu widened his eyes and tried to turn around to look at Miao Yi, with a trembling mouth, and anger in his eyes that cannot be described.
He finally understood that this was a trap, and the collapse of the mountain gate plaque was not only to frame him, but also to separate his fellow disciples from him, to prevent him from uniting with his fellow disciples and resisting, the main goal was his life.
