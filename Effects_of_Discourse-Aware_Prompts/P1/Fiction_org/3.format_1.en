"What are you guys doing?!".

"Our ancestor is coming soon. Please don't be impatient, Old Master of the East Palace. You will find out what we're going to do later." replied the man in charge.
The Old Master of the East Palace naturally knew who the "ancestor" referred to in the man's words.
He was a bit at a loss and didn't know why Pei Yi had come.
Having a festival with DK is really not a good thing. Although everyone in Country R wants to chase DK out, they can't do it.
It's just a daydream.
After a few minutes, Pei Yi's car arrived.
He got out of the car and shifted his gaze to the car not far away.
An Xiao Ning saw him and, without taking off her mask and wig, also got out of the car.
Wu Lian Zhi followed closely behind.
"You're here," An Xiao Ning spoke out.
Pei Yi looked her up and down, rarely laughing, and walked up to her, closing in a few inches, lowering his voice and saying, "Hey, it's hard for these people to guess it's you with this outfit, right?"
"Of course, I just don't want them to know my identity, that's why I asked you to come. Now is not the time."
Pei Yi glanced unconsciously at Wu Lian Zhi, "How are you with him?"
"Something."
He straightened up, turned around, and with a faint smile on his face, said to the people of the Dong Gong family, "I don't know where my sister has offended someone from your Dong Gong family, that they want to kill her?"
"Do you have the audacity to grow up to your head?"
The people from Dong Gong family heard it and their faces changed instantly, Pei Yi's younger sister?
Where did Pei Yi's sister come from?
The old woman from the Dong Gong family spoke out, "Mr. Pei's sister... We really don't know anything about it."
"I don't know how to say it, but now I'm telling you."
Pei Yi spoke in a cold voice, "Did you hear me clearly?"
The old man from the Dong Gong family spoke, "Since Mr. Pei says this is your cousin, then please take your cousin away. As for Dong Gong Lian Zhi, his name is still on our family tree and he has not yet been disowned as a rebellious descendant, so he is still a member of our Dong Gong family. How we deal with him is a matter of our family affairs."
Pei Yi didn't reply, An Xiao Ning saw the opportunity and yelled at him, "Brother, he's my boyfriend, I have his flesh and blood in my belly now, you can't abandon him."
Pei Yi originally wanted to just take her away, but now it's a bit complicated.
However, being domineering is also his style, as long as he wants to do something, this matter is no big deal.
"Old granny, you heard it too, this one... is also my brother-in-law. They have children now, handing over the person to you, wouldn't it mean the children won't have a father in the future?"
"Do you think I would agree?"
The old woman of the Dong Gong family knows very well that if she lets Pei take the person away, they will not be able to deal with their grandson in a legitimate and upright manner in the future. So, although she is wary of DK's power, she cannot let her attitude weaken.
"Mr. Pei, I'm afraid this is not possible. Our family has our own family rules. Outsiders are not allowed to interfere in the handling of our own people."
"They say he's the father of the baby in my sister's stomach, are you getting old and your ears aren't working?"
Pei Yileng shifted his gaze towards Wu Lianzhi and asked, "What do you have to say, are you a member of the Donggong family?"
"This morning, when my mother delivered poisonous food to me, I immediately severed the mother-daughter relationship with her. Before that, when the people from the Donggong family attempted to kill Miss An, myself and his subordinates in an accident, I already had a clear understanding. Now, although the name Donggong Lianzhi is still in the family registry and the household registration of the Donggong family, I am no longer surnamed Donggong. I am now surnamed Wu, and Wu Lianzhi is my current name. I am no longer a member of the Donggong family!"
"Each word is powerful, each sentence gives off a cold intent."
Saying these words openly in front of so many people demonstrates his determination.
"This is not what you said!" The old lady of the East Palace said, "Entering my East Palace, life is our family, and death is the ghost of our family!"
"Mrs. Donggong, I would like to ask you, you have known that Miss An's murdering Miss An. You are in a mood here to punish me here, and don't worry about the serious negotiations on the other side of S?"
This is from Wu Lianzhi's mouth. His tone is rusty and fearless.
"I have dealt with An Xiaoling." Pei Yi smiled slightly. "She is the type of person who has revenge. If you want her life, can she give up?"
"Well, stop talking nonsense. My time is precious. I took both of them."
When he saw that the people of the East Palace family were going to speak again, he added, "If you don't want to see blood here."
In this way, the people of the Donggong family watched the ducks that had been cooked completely fly away.
The old lady and the old master of the East Palace are really not good.
Finally, Old Lady Donggong said directly, "Forget it, remove his name and destroy his account!"
"We have to go back to country S."
Pei Yi glanced at her and said, "Withdraw after using it?"
"Didn't you say that you would grant me a request? I didn't even say that, so I said to return home?"
"I am anxious to return home, but it is true to promise you a request. Come on, what request?"
"Well, my request may be a little difficult for you..."
"Don't mention it. Say one that makes me feel comfortable."
Pei Yi turned around and stared at her, "You really haven't changed a bit. You've been with me for half a month."
"How can I accompany you?"
"Same as before."
An Xiaoling looked at him and said, "No, first, I can't chain up, I can't restrict my freedom. The second half month is too long, two days is OK."
"......" Pei Yi smiled a little, "You have cut the price too far. Five days, you can't be less. You can't say that you are asking others to ask. If others ask you, you can't break your promise. You will certainly give you freedom."
Can I go home first?
No.
Wu Lianzhi in the car listened to the conversation between the two people and really felt that they had an affair?
Is there an indistinct relationship between the two people?
It sounds like it anyway.
But if it is, those two people are too open to him.
Then let him go back to S first, and I'll be there alone, OK?
I won't do anything to you. Let's go together. His words are beyond doubt.
An Xiaoling said nothing more.
It was not far from Qingping Mountain, so it was soon there.
Come to this place again, I really have mixed feelings.
Qin Guo was really unhappy at the moment he saw her. When they went in, she immediately rolled her eyes.
She wondered how her ancestors had brought the god of plague back.
