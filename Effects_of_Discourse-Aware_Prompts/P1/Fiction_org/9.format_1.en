"This is just to give you a feel for the fluctuation of breath, it's really simple." The other wizard next to him couldn't help but interject with a smile.
"Thank you for your help."
Lin Sheng nodded.
He needs to find the other fragments at the fastest speed. Originally, he was planning to get more pure soul power by defeating more evil spirits from the government.
But now that he has encountered such an opportunity, the best way is to grab it as quickly as possible.
Soon, the wizard leader led Lin Sheng to stand in front of an evil spirit gate.
Both of them reached out and gently touched the edge of the evil spirit gate, closing their eyes at the same time.
The wizard leader quickly used his abilities to start constructing a space foundation as a coordinate.
Then, following the ritual fluctuations of the evil spirit gate, the wizard leader took Lin Sheng's perception and both of them were launched out by the ritual fluctuations.
"The ordinary portal ritual is a point-to-point directional transmission."
"But when we usually explore other space secrets, we transform the point-to-point into point-to-many."
"This only requires a small modification of parameters on the transmission foundation."
While leading Lin Sheng's consciousness, the wizard leader also taught him relevant skills.
"In this way, the evil spirit gate will automatically transmit our consciousness to multiple possible spaces similar to the target space."
"This is basically using energy to rely on luck. If luck is good, we might hit the desired space secret realm at once. If luck is bad, we have to waste energy and try several times."
"That's pretty random."
Lin Sheng was speechless.
As soon as his perception entered the evil door, it was immediately wrapped in the ceremony waves and scattered outwards.
At the same time, it was as if his consciousness had split, his sense of perception was divided into more than ten parts, and at the same time, he perceived the atmosphere of more than ten completely different spaces.
"Typically, our consciousness during transmission is difficult to maintain integrity, so we can only remember the spatial coordinates that the main consciousness has encountered as much as possible."
"The memory of the coordinates requires us to leave a simple mark...."
The outside sorcerer is still explaining in a low voice while guiding Lin Sheng and teaching him how to make a simple mark in order to determine the coordinate code.
However, he had no idea that the conscious soul of Hollock was too strong and tenacious. After being split out, he could remember all the coordinates of the space that more than ten consciousness came into contact with.
It's just more than ten purposes. This is nothing to Lin Sheng, whose soul consciousness can be used wholeheartedly. Every day, he is exercising his skill of concentrating on dozens of purposes.
Every summon, he can control and observe through the split consciousness soul. So now he can't control many summoners and act independently.
But just remember the breath wave and set up the coordinates separately.
In addition, his soul is more tenacious than ordinary people and has a longer existence. This is still very easy.
ten minutes later. The consciousness is exhausted and dissipated.
Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the warlock.
"Give me the space secret of this coordinate. "He immediately said one of the special space secret coordinates under the staring of the warlock chief and others.
The secret space of this coordinate is exactly what Lin Sheng perceives. It has a special space of the same origin as the Yinzhuan evil wheel fragments in his arms.
"Did you succeed once?"
The warlock was a little bitter in his heart. It took him more than half a month to perceive the atmosphere of space for the first time, determine the coordinates and record them.
"Very simple operation."
"Start, build the portal."
"I want to go, Lin Sheng said."
"Yes."
"And so on."
The voice of Tiangongxia's soul made Lin Sheng move slowly.
"What?"
While watching the warlock and others start to order the evil spirits to move the material resources, he went to the side and waited, while communicating with Tiangongxia in his mind.
"There is a situation here. There has been a big change on the other side of Bishaga Island!"
The tone of Tiangong Xia is slightly dignified.
This is a sign that Lin Sheng has never seen.
You know, even if he told Tiangongxia about the existence of the night king, he never saw her so serious.
This made him feel an abnormal sense of tension.
"Miguel should be at an absolute disadvantage?"
Lin Sheng frowned and asked.
"Or is there a new force to join?"
"No, it's not a new force. Tiangongxia said solemnly."
"But Miyue cheated everyone!"
"What's the matter?"
"The Seven-lock Pagoda has long been successfully summoned. Miyue deceived everyone in the three secret realms. He has already successfully summoned Farudo! Use himself as a sacrifice! Integrate with it!"
Lin Sheng suddenly became conscious.
"Sacrifice yourself?"
"... this crazy man!"
"So now, the three secret realms are facing the fusion monster of Miyue and Farudo...."
Lin Sheng was speechless.
“What should we do now?”
Heavenly work coagulates the heavy road.
Farudo combined with Miyue. The superposition of the two is not as simple as one plus one equals two, but the result of three times ten.
"Don't get excited."
"For Miyue and Farudo, the biggest enemies are the three secret places and many other big forces."
"And the world is not as simple as you think."
Lin Sheng thought of the information he had investigated and obtained before.
"The big star pool and those who hold the sacred weapon of destiny are not simple characters."
"As long as he doesn't provoke us, we don't care how they develop."
"I see what you mean."
"But it's better to prepare early," Tiangongxia reminded.
"I once had that level of destructive power. It was in the period when I was manipulated by the magic sword."
"So I am very clear about what kind of results that level of power will lead to."
Lin Sheng was silent.
Among all his commanders, Tiangongxia is the most special one. Because Tiangongxia was once influenced and controlled by a powerful existence.
At that time, she even found Lin Sheng's peep in her memory.
It is just an image mark in the memory, and Lin Sheng who peeps at the memory can be found.
Such power has gone beyond Lin Sheng's understanding.
"I know." Lin Sheng replied again.
"I will be ready."
"Don't worry."
It is impossible to open the strongest special state, summon all commanding forces, and melt them into themselves.
Disconnecting from Tiangongxia, Linsheng quietly stared at the newly built new evil spirit gate. The mind returns to the original train of thought.
"Open it. Honor," said the warlock in a low voice.
Lin Sheng stared at the portal and remained silent for a moment.
"Let the goblin king come. Besides, Degal!"
The Devil of Degal had already arrived nearby and waited.
Hearing the call, he immediately walked in from the door.
"Sir, I will obey your orders."
Lin Sheng nodded.
"I want to open multiple portals at the same time and explore multiple evil spirit spaces."
"You choose one hundred great evil spirits and divide them into different number of teams for exploratory exploration."
"Yes!"
The Devil Degar was awe-inspiring, and knew that he might have encountered some turning point.
Otherwise, it would not be so urgent to explore on a large scale.
