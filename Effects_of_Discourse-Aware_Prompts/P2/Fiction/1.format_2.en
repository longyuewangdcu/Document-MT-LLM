The wind blows through the canyon, stirring up ripples on the plain.
The wild buffalo, chewing on tender grass leaves, raises its head and looks towards the sky.
Over there, a wooden merchant ship several tens of meters long is suspended in the air, its full sails bulging with the wind's gusts and moving forward slowly.
"No matter when you look, the wind is always so spectacular."
The middle-aged man in leather armor stood by the deck, overlooking the vast plain and the beautiful scenery below.
"For us merchants, this is also a rare business opportunity."
Standing next to the middle-aged man was a slightly plump merchant with a quirky head of curly hair, dressed in a merchant's robe, with his small eyes slightly squinted, as if calculating something, gazing at the scenery in front of him, it seems that even the beautiful scenery in front of him can be sold for money.
"If it weren't for it, I'm afraid we wouldn't be able to transport goods to the central region so quickly."
"To be honest, I was opposed when I first planned to expand this market, but now it looks like my choice was indeed correct."
"But please excuse me for speaking directly, you did not choose the major waterways, instead you go from here, although it saves time, but the degree of danger will also increase."
"I heard that things on the other side aren't peaceful lately. And, I think you also heard the captain's warning. It seems that there are wind snakes around here lately, just in case..."
The man's face became somewhat grave and he turned his head, directing his gaze towards the mountains not far away.
The towering peaks blocking his view and he couldn't see what was behind.
But he could see vaguely that the sky in the distance wasn't a pure blue, but had a touch of gloomy darkness.
That wasn't a world they should be involved in.
"Relax, there's no need for so many 'just in case' scenarios. Riches come with dangers, that's why I spent so much money hiring you guys!"
"Just a few snakes, right?"
The merchant stretched out his hand and patted the man's shoulder.
"By the way, how is that young man we rescued doing now?"
"He hasn't died yet."
"Lijie has already bandaged the wound for him, he is now unconscious and there should be no life danger."
"This will do."
"Upon hearing the man's response, the merchant nodded satisfactorily, but soon after he frowned."
"But, what kind of injury did that young man receive? From the wound, it looks like a large lizard, but is there anything strange like that in the northern region of Pafield?"
"I'm not sure, sir, but it probably was a very fierce wild beast, I hope we don't encounter them."
"Saying that, the man unconsciously glanced at the entrance of the cabin, then turned his head forward again."
"Rodd opened his eyes."
"What happened?"
"He gazed at the ceiling in front of him in a daze, his brain feeling groggy."
"He remembered that he should have been leading his team to fight against the most powerful boss, the Void Dragon, in the Dragon Soul mainland before, and he successfully got the first kill. He was sure he got the achievement and system prompt, but then the Void Dragon's final blow took his life."
[Originally according to the original plan, Rod should have been resurrected in the cemetery and then logged off.]
[But at the moment he was killed by the Void Dragon, the whole world immediately turned black, as if it was forcibly isolated, and then Rod lost consciousness.]
[How is this possible?]
[Could it be that there is a problem with the game?]
[Rod barely turned his head and could see the blue sky and white clouds through the window. Where is he?]
[What is this place?]
[What exactly happened?]
[Is he still dreaming?]
[Or is he still in the game?]
[At least Rod can be sure that this place is definitely not his narrow rental apartment.
"At this thought, doubts immediately surged into Rod's heart, he frowned and then tried to sit up. "
"Ugh!!!!"
" At this moment, a huge pain suddenly came from Rod's chest, he bit his teeth and stopped moving. "
"And at this moment, Rod realized that his left shoulder and chest had been completely wrapped in bandages, although he didn't know what had happened, but from the blood stains that were seeping through, he was clearly not lightly injured. "
"This is definitely not a game!"
" Rod could be sure of this, because although technology is now quite advanced, as the world's first virtual global network game, Dragon's Soul Land also uses a lot of high-tech technology. But according to the rules, players are not allowed to experience pain, this is to distinguish reality from the game, and also to consider reducing player barriers. "
"When a player is injured, instead of pain, the game uses a series of methods such as reducing the player's speed of action and using a red that represents danger to obstruct the view to warn and remind the player, rather than truly simulating pain. "
"This behavior caused quite a big controversy in society when holographic simulation technology first appeared, and the operator of Dragon's Soul Land of course would know this. "
"Rod lowered his head and looked at his right hand, it was not the role he had created in the game, not the body full of muscles and wildness. "
"On the contrary, the arm in front of him was slender and weak, because it was not exposed to the sun for a long time, the skin was somewhat pale and sickly."
[This is his body in reality, he is very clear about this.]
[But how could he have been hurt?]
[Moreover, this doesn't look like a hospital?]
[Rode looked up and the whole room appeared to be a cabin with no lights, no phone, and no call bell.]
[A wooden table, two chairs, and a cabinet fixed to the wall are all the possessions in this room.]
[For some reason, Rode felt like he had seen this scene somewhere before.]
[Just as Rode was closely examining the room, the door suddenly opened.]
[A golden-haired girl in a white gown walked into the room, she looked at Rode who was half-sitting, with some surprise and wide-open eyes.]
["You're awake? That's great!!"]
[The language the girl spoke was not Chinese nor English, but Rode could understand her clearly.].
"This made Rod somewhat surprised, he knew this language."
"This is Nimm language, one of the official languages of the Dragon Soul continent!"
"How do you feel? Are you okay?"
"But the girl didn't pay attention to Rod's expression, she quickly walked to Rod's side and carefully examined his left shoulder and chest."
"Your injury is really serious, to be honest, I'm a little worried about whether you can hold on..."
"This is..."
"Rod frowned, but he didn't know what to say, he turned his head and looked at the mirror on the wall next to him. There was a clear reflection of his own face, it was indeed his face, but it shouldn't appear here."
"Did you forget?"
"The blonde girl blinked her eyes a little doubtfully, her twin tails also swayed slightly with her movements, her blue eyes were clear and transparent, giving a lively feeling."
"Two days ago, you fell in the Pafield Mountains and suffered serious injuries."
"If it wasn't for the cargo ship from the 'Silver Platter' trade guild passing by, things would be pretty bad."
"I really don't know what you're fighting against. Your left side has been seriously injured and it was really dangerous at that time."
"Wait, left shoulder?"
"Rod was stunned, and he immediately remembered that he was attacked on the left side when he was fighting the Void Dragon in the game."
"But that was only his game character getting hurt, and it shouldn't have anything to do with the player himself. But now, it's the player who's injured?"
"Although the situation was chaotic, Rod quickly regained his composure, a testament to his quality as a top player and the leader of the world's most powerful online gaming guild."
"During his conversation with the blond girl, Rod learned about his current situation. He was badly injured and lying on the Plains of Pasfeld, and the floating ship from the Silver Platter trade guild just happened to pass by and rescued him."
"According to the blond girl, Rod's initial situation wasn't optimistic, but his recovery ability was quite good."
"My name is Leah, a member of the Star Moon mercenary group and a spiritualist. You can call me Leah."
"The girl introduced herself to Rod in a straightforward manner."
"My name is Rod. Arant."
"Although he couldn't organize the situation in front of him yet, Rod hesitated for a moment and still reported his identity and ID in the game."
"From the Eastern Mountain Range, I am an adventurer."
"Adventurer, so that's why you're alone in the deep mountains so far away."
"Hearing Rod's answer, Lijie was not surprised because on this continent, many adventurers like to explore on their own, so Rod's reported identity was not a big problem."
"But what are you fighting with?"
"Why were you injured so severely?"
"I remember there shouldn't be any particularly scary monsters in this plain area."
"Hearing the girl's inquiry, Rod laughed awkwardly, feeling a little embarrassed."
"What could he say, tell Lijie that he was injured when fighting against one of the five dragons known as the Void Dragon?"
"Because I was attacked at night, I didn't see clearly what the other party was. There were many of them and they were fast. I think it might be something from 'over there.'"
"I understand."
Although Rod didn't explain in detail, Lijie seemed to understand what was going on, nodding her head, and then she carefully checked Rod's wound before standing up.
"You haven't eaten for two days, so I guess you're very hungry. Please wait, I'll go get some food right now."
"Oh, right, I also need to report this to the leader. I think he'll come to see you soon."
After saying this, the girl politely nodded to Rod and then turned and left the room.
