This is exactly what Song Fu and others wanted to ask, but someone beat them to it, they looked at each other, not knowing what was going on, where they could answer it. 
Miao Yi immediately flew to where the loud sound came from, and Yan Xiu and the others immediately followed. 
Song Fu and the others looked at each other, and followed to see what was going on. 
When they arrived at the entrance of the mountain gate, they saw that the moonlight was down and the stone carving plaque with the words "East Comes Cave" had been broken into pieces, which shocked everyone. Someone had destroyed the mountain gate of the East Comes Cave. 
Miao Yi suddenly turned around and looked at Song Fu and others with a fierce look, and coldly laughed repeatedly: "Good!" 
"I just arrived today, it seems that someone can't wait to give me a lesson!" 
"Very good!" 
Song Fu and others were stunned, they understood what the other party meant, but this was definitely not done by them, because they were just sitting together and having a small gathering, and it was only when they heard the unusual sound that they ran out. 
Several people still suspected that it was Miao Yi and others who did it, but seeing Miao Yi's appearance, they felt that Miao Yi did not have to destroy his own mountain gate to give himself a color to see, after all, Miao Yi was the master of the East Comes Cave. It was a disgraceful thing to have the plaque broken just after taking office. 
This matter must be cleared up, otherwise, once it is poked, they cannot bear the responsibility. Song Fu respectfully bowed and said: "Master, this is not what we did!"
"Several others also followed and raised their fists to guarantee, seemingly for the first time treating Miao Yi as the Cave Master in a serious manner."
"Sly!"
Miao Yi stared at Song Fu and loudly said: "I only appointed you to guard the mountain gate today. How would you not know if someone destroyed the mountain gate?"
"Is it that you are intentionally letting things slide!"
"This..."
Song Fu was at a loss for words. He was not here at all, and now it's not good to say that I didn't pay attention to you as the Cave Master, so he could only raise his fist and honestly explain: "The Cave Master may not know the situation just arrived. The miscellaneous workers from Donglai City have not yet been sent, and I and others have to take care of our own food and drink. In order to satisfy our hunger, the subordinates temporarily left, but we did not expect this to happen."
King Zifa and others also raised their fists one after another to prove: "Cave Master, we can prove that Elder Brother Song Fu was just eating with us."
Miao Yi pointed to the fallen archway and loudly said: "Did it fall by itself? Don't tell me it was blown down by the wind!"
Song Fu was a little speechless, he had to raise his hand and say: "Cave Master, I can swear to the ancestors of my Lan Yumen that this was not our doing. If there is a word of false, let me, Song Fu, die a terrible death!"
Miao Yi's gaze flickered uncertainly over the crowd, and he said in a gloomy tone: "Is someone coming to my Donglai Cave to cause trouble?"
Everyone was shocked and quickly looked around.
“What are you still waiting for here? Don't you want to be killed in your sleep?”
“Hurry up and start searching!”
Miao Yi yelled in anger.
Yan Xiu and the two others first nodded and then quickly spread out into the surrounding forest.
“Hmm?”
Miao Yi snorted heavily, staring at Song Fu and others, seemingly questioning why they weren't searching if it wasn't their doing and if they knew something.
Song Fu immediately turned around and shouted, “Don't you obey the orders of the cave master to search?”
Everyone bowed to Miao Yi and then dispersed.
However, Miao Yi stopped Song Fu, “Song Fu, come with me!”
Song Fu stunned for a moment, held his fist and said, and followed Miao Yi's footsteps.
Just after everyone left, a phantom shadow appeared in the original place, not someone else, but the legendary old white figure.
Only to see the old white staring at the fallen stone monument, slightly nodding and laughing softly: "The world is like chess, how can hot-blooded men only have the courage of commoners!"
"I have always worried that you are too kind-hearted, and easily taken advantage of... Men should be ruthless, and ordinary thugs are difficult to reach the sky. Now I am relieved."
The words fell, the whole shadow swayed like water waves, and quietly disappeared without a trace in the swaying.
The east came to the hall and the candles swayed, Song Fu and Miao Yi stood one after the other in the hall, and the outside charcoal has stood up, as if feeling something and sneezing.
Miao Yi stared at his throne expressionlessly, with his back facing Song Fu, without a word.
The atmosphere between the two was a bit suppressed, Song Fu waited for a while, finally couldn't help but asked: "What does the owner of the cave want from me?"
Miao Yi spoke in a gloomy tone: "Song Fu, do you know the crime?"
Song Fu's mouth showed a sneer, glanced at the food and wine on the low table beside him, and said calmly: "This is not what we did, what crime does Song Fu have?"
"That's not what I asked!"
Miao Yi turned around abruptly, staring at him, and asked coldly, word by word: "I ordered you to guard the mountain gate. Why did you neglect your duty? Do you not put my orders as the cave master in your eyes!"
Song Fu thought, "What do you think?"
"It wasn't in my eyes in the first place."
Of course, he wouldn't say that out loud, "Song Fu has reported to the cave master, it was truly helpless, I only temporarily left for my stomach, and I don't want to see such a thing happen."
Miao Yi asked, "Do you think the master of the mansion and the mountain master will believe your explanation if I report this matter to them?"
Song Fu laughed and said, "People have two faces, if the cave master wants to frame Song Fu, then go ahead, but the cave master should not forget, Song Fu also has a mouth to defend himself, not a mute."
Miao Yi sneered and said, "It seems that you really don't regret it!"
Upon hearing this, Yan Xiu, Dan Biaoyi, and Qiu Shao appeared outside the door together, they walked in and saluted Miao Yi: "Cave master, there is no suspicious person found temporarily."
Miao Yi said, "The suspicious person is right in front of you, how can there be no discovery when you said so!"
Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun seem to have received the signal and quickly shut the palace gate.
Song Fu was shocked by the sound and quickly turned around, but saw Yan Xiu's pair of chopping axes coming with a killing intent.
Song Fu quickly drew out his sword and a cold light came out of the scabbard. He quickly made a move to defend himself.
Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun also quickly pointed their guns and joined forces to attack Song Fu.
Yan Xiu and Song Fu's martial arts were almost equal, and they were evenly matched. With Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun joining forces, Song Fu's situation became suddenly dangerous.
"Shameless thief!"
"How dare you plot against... "
Surrounded and unable to escape, Song Fu could only wave his sword and fight Yan Xiu desperately. His loud roar of anger and grief had not finished when he was penetrated by two piercing guns that broke through his magical defense and severely penetrated his chest.
Song Fu stared wide-eyed and tried to turn to look at Miao Yi, his lips trembled, and the anger in his eyes was indescribable.
He finally understood that this was a trap. The collapse of the mountain gate was not only to frame him, but also to move away his fellow disciples to avoid his counterattack. The main goal was to take his life.
