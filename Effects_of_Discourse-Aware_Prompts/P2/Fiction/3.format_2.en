"What are you guys doing?!",
The East Palace master knocked on the cane in his hand, his voice carrying anger.
"Our ancestor will arrive soon. Please calm down, East Palace master. You'll know what's going on soon enough," the lead man replied.
The East Palace master naturally knew who the "ancestor" referred to in his mouth.
He was a bit at a loss and didn't know why Pei Yi had come.
Having a festival with DK really wasn't a good thing. Although everyone in R country wanted to drive DK out, they simply couldn't do it.
It was just a pipe dream.
A few minutes later, Pei Yi's car arrived.
He got out of the car and his gaze shifted to the car not far away.
An Xiaoning saw him and, without taking off her mask and wig, also got out of the car.
"Wu Lian Zhi followed closely behind."
"You've come." An Xiao Ning spoke out.
Pei Yi gave her a once-over, then he smiled rare, walked up to her and got closer to her, lowering his voice, "Hey, seeing your disguise, no one would guess it's you, right?"
"Of course, I don't want them to know my identity, that's why I asked you to come, it's not the right time yet."
Pei Yi glanced unconsciously at Wu Lian Zhi and said, "How are you with him?"
"For something."
He straightened up, turned around and spoke to the people from the Dong Gong family with a smile on his face, "I don't know what my sister has done to offend you guys from the Dong Gong family, that you want to kill her?"
"Do you have the audacity to reach up to the sky?"
The people from the Dong Gong family heard this and their faces changed instantly, Pei Yi's sister?
Where did Pei Yi's sister come from?
The old woman from the East Palace spoke out, "Mr. Pei's younger sister... we really don't know anything about her."
"It's hard to say if we don't know, but now I'm telling you."
Pei Yi said coldly, "Did you hear clearly?"
"Since Mr. Pei says this is your cousin, then please take your cousin away. As for Dong Gong Lian, his name is still in my family tree, he has not been expelled from the family yet, he is still a member of my Dong Gong family, how we deal with him is our Dong Gong family's affair."
Before Pei Yi could answer, An Xiao Ning saw an opportunity and shouted at him, "Brother, he is my boyfriend, I have his flesh and blood in my belly now, you can't just abandon him."
Pei Yi originally only wanted to take her away, but now it's a bit tricky.
However, being rough and domineering is also his style, as long as he wants to do something, this matter is not a big deal.
"Old lady, you have heard it too, this person... is also my younger sister's husband, they both have children, if you give him to them, wouldn't the children be without a father in the future?"
"Do you think I would agree?"
The old woman from the East Palace was very clear, if she let Pei Yi take the person away, then they would not be able to handle their own grandson openly and fairly in the future, so, although she was wary of DK's power, she could not weaken her attitude.
"Mr. Pei, this probably won't do. We have our own laws at home, and outsiders are not allowed to interfere in the disposal of our own people."
"They say he is the father of the child in my sister's belly, are your ears not working well because you're getting old?"
Pei Yiturns his gaze towards Wu Lianzhi, "You tell me, are you from the Donggong family?"
"This morning, when my mother sent me poisonous food, I immediately severed our mother-daughter relationship. Before that, when someone from the Donggong family attempted to kill me, Miss An and her subordinates as an accident, I already understood clearly. Now, although the name Lianzhi is still in the family tree and Donggong household registration book, I no longer have the surname Donggong. Now I have the surname Wu, Wu Lianzhi is my current name, I am no longer a member of the Donggong family!"
"Each word was resounding and full of power, each sentence was full of cold meaning."
"Speaking openly in front of so many people shows his determination."
"This is not what you said!" said the Donggong Old Lady, "Being born into my Donggong family, we are family in life and ghosts in death!"
"Madam Donggong, I would like to ask you, now that Miss An knows about your plot to kill her, do you not fear that the country S will take a serious stand in dealing with the matter when you want to punish and dispose of me here?"
"This came from Wu Lianzhi's mouth, with a cold tone and no fear."
"I have dealt with Miss An.‚Äù Pei Yi smiled slightly, "She is the type of person who will seek revenge if wronged. Do you think she will be able to endure it if you want her life?"
"Okay, no more nonsense, my time is valuable, I'll take these two with me."
"The people from Donggong family are speaking again, and he added another sentence, 'if you don't want to see blood here.'"
"And so, the people from Donggong family watched as the previously cooked duck flew away completely."
"Donggong Old Lady and Old Grandpa were so angry they couldn't handle it."
"Finally, Donggong Old Lady spoke directly, 'forget it, forget it, remove his name, and cancel his household registration!'"
"We have to go back to S country."
Pei Yixie glanced at her, "Use it and then withdraw?"
"Didn't you say you would agree to one of my requests? I haven't even said what it is yet, and you're already saying to go back home?"
"I'm in a hurry to go back home because I have something to do, but I also promised you a request, so tell me, what is it?"
"Well, my request may be a bit difficult for you..."
"Let's not mention it, say something that won't make me feel uncomfortable."
Pei Yixue leaned over, staring at her intently, "You really haven't changed a bit, spend a month with me."
"What kind of companion?"
"Like before."
An Xiaonong looked at him, "No, first, I can't be on a leash, can't limit my freedom. Second, a month is too long, two days is enough."
"... " Pei Yixue's smile faded slightly, "You're bargaining too much, five days, no less. You said you would let someone make a request, someone made a request, and you can't be untrustworthy, I'm sure I'll give you freedom."
"Can I go back to my country first?"
"No."
Wu Lianzhi, who was in the car, was listening to the conversation between the two people, and she really felt that these two people were in a relationship.
Could these two people have an unclear relationship?
It sounds like they're in a relationship when I listen to it.
But if that's the case, then it's too disrespectful of them to do so in front of him.
"Can I go back to S country first, and you stay there by yourself? Is that okay?"
"I won't do anything to you guys, let's go together." His words were undeniable.
An Xiaoning didn't say anything anymore.
As the distance from Qingping Mountain wasn't far, they soon arrived.
Coming back to this place, there were really mixed feelings.
Qin Guo saw her and was truly unhappy in that moment. As soon as they went inside, she immediately rolled her eyes.
Thinking in her heart, how did her ancestors bring this plague back again.
