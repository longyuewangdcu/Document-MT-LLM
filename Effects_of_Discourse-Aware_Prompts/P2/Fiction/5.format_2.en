"Xiaomo was deeply moved and felt a great sadness."
"The leader must be... afraid to move."
"Once his body started to move, his mind also had to start moving. How could someone as intelligent as him not know that Bai Weiwei was already dead?"
"He was unwilling to admit it and dared not to think deeply about it. He could only force himself to sit there and convince himself that Bai Weiwei was just sleeping and would wake up."
"Xiaomo felt that it was only when Bai Weiwei's body began to rot that the leader would truly regain his senses and realize that the person he was holding hands with had already been dead for a long time."
"But strangely, Bai Weiwei's body showed no signs of change."
"Even her pale face had improved and although her body was still cold, it was clearly as if she was just asleep."
"Not a single characteristic of a corpse was present."
"Muyun Jun kept watch over her and his gaze became brighter."
And finally, the legendary doctor, the old man with a bad temper, was arrested. He ate his heart-protective pill and said, "Half of my old life is probably gone."
Muyan Jun has not slept for five days, and everyone can see how tired he is.
But his entire being is surprisingly alert, alarmingly alert and abnormal.
"After she took the medicine from me, she fell asleep like this, I think I should ask you to come and see when she will wake up."
The old man sighed and walked to the bedside to take the pulse of Bai Weiwei.
"Actually, this phenomenon is extremely rare, treatment is not needed, but there is still one particularly important thing to do..."
Muyan Jun listened intently, like a good student, with a blazing fire in his eyes.
The old man's voice dropped, "It means I have to treat another person again..."
Muyan Jun leaned forward, unwilling to miss a word from him.
As a result, the old man's technique was lightning-fast, and he immediately injected a needle into his neck.
Muyan Jun's eyes suddenly opened wide, and his hand already struck the old man's head.
Xiaomo's hand stretched out horizontally and grabbed Muyan's attack.
Back and forth, Muyan couldn't hold on and fainted from exhaustion.
The old man touched his head, "I almost died, but I guess I won't live much longer. If he wakes up and doesn't go crazy, it'll be a miracle."
Bai Weiwei can't be saved.
Muyan's condition was deeply disturbing, with problems arising in all his internal organs.
Not eating, sleeping, thinking, or moving, he was no different from a dead person. If he can last two more days, he'll be dead like Bai Weiwei.
Xiaomo looked at the old man, "You're guarding my family's leader's life. If you can't protect him this time, I'll kill you myself."
After she finished speaking, she turned around and went to their place of punishment, silently accepting the punishment.
The old man sighed, "No wonder my master said that even selling sweet potatoes can't be a physician, everyone thinks I'm a god, but even a god can't make a person who wants to die live."
Muyan only slept for two hours, but his eyes opened.
He was shocked, his eyes rarely appeared panicked, but he found himself unable to move.
Old Man Zao saw that he woke up, "I'll give you an acupuncture needle. Your spirit is depleted, but if I nurse you, you should go see King Yan."
Muyan's eyes darkened, his face pale and haggard, but full of evil spirit, making people look at him with horror.
Old Man Zao gave him another needle, "I didn't want to save you at first. After all, you have a heart that is as vicious as yours. If I save you, who knows what chaos the world will become."
Muyan's voice was soft and strange, "Let me go."
Old Man Zao shook his head, "That's not possible. I can't save your heartless person. If I save you, I guess it's a compensation."
Muyan suddenly laughed mournfully, "You can't make up for it, how can you make up for it? Even if you save all the people in the world, you can't make up for a hair of her." He escaped.
