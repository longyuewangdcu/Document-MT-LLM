"The situation has turned upside down and both sides are firing with all their might, creating a smoke-filled sky over the ocean."
"The high-speed magnetic wave scanner in White Night's hand fires again, and another aircraft is shattered by him. This weapon is really effective, and he enjoys using it. Little Darling commands with ease, forming an unbreakable offensive-defensive team of the first terrorist organization's air force, and starting the final round of a fierce attack."
"Seeing the situation is not good, Nick also doesn't care about dignity, he raises his voice and says, 'Master, let's retreat. If we continue to fight like this, our whole army will be destroyed.'"
"Louis clenches his fist tightly, his face dark and full of resentment. He clearly sees the current situation."
"But he is unwilling, to be defeated like this. Even though it is close at hand, he can still catch them, but the effort was wasted, it's really hateful."
"The man with jade green eyes glances over the killing intent and then disappears into the silent and melancholic eyes. He nods at Nick, and he immediately orders to cover the retreat."
"Louis stares at the two floating in the sky above the sea, snorts coldly, this time they were lucky. He won't let it end like this."
"Baby, they are retreating, shall we chase?" White Night laughs lightly, he has a special fondness for the magnetic wave scanner, holding it as if holding a child, with a casual but dangerous smile on his lips.
Little Darling also smiles gracefully, orders to stop the attack, and a calmness fills the dark big eyes, slowly saying: "No pursuit, just let him die like that, it's too wasteful. The game of cat and mouse has just begun."
"This game has already reversed the situation."
"Louis, he shouldn't, he shouldn't provoke him. Nuno's death, he must find someone to accompany the burial, otherwise he can't swallow this breath."
"When does the game start, Louis said the final word, but..."
"The little milk bag smiled coldly and was imposing, when will it end, he said the final word."
"White Night smiled and swung his sleeves, "Okay, no pursuit. We have capital to play with him. Maybe it's not their turn to take action. Louis will have someone eager to clean up."
"The little milk bag watched the direction they escaped and coldly laughed without speaking."
"Chu Li, it's over, no support is needed, we will return immediately."
"White Night and Chu Li communicated and ordered their subordinates to turn back to Rome."
"Black Hawk and others used all their strength to drag Ye San Shao and Cheng Anya up, they all knew Cheng Anya was infected with the virus and had taken protective measures, Ye San Shao also warned them that he also had the virus, and Black Hawk and others were even more careful."
"Ye San Shao was lying down, panting like a cow, couldn't help but kick Miss Cheng, "Xiao Anya, you have to lose weight, you're dead."
"His entire shoulder was a little numb because he swam in the seawater for a long time and consumed a lot of physical energy, and then hanging Cheng Anya was really enough to bother his arms."
[He almost didn't catch her and threw her into the sea, and thinking back to that scene still made him feel a little scared.]
, [Black Hawk and others cheered for their safety, passing towels, pouring hot water, everyone was busy, and someone took the opportunity to joke about how Ye Sanshao had been spending these days.]
, [The atmosphere on the plane was lively, with men together, and it was inevitable to have a heroic feeling.]
, [Cheng Anya took the towel handed over by Black Hawk to wipe her hair and wrapped her body that was getting cold with a blanket, her ears automatically blocked his words, finally, she was safe. She sneezed and couldn't help but wrap herself tighter.]
, [Black Hawk chuckled and said, "Sanshao, if the lady gets any skinnier, you will complain that she is like ribs."]
, ["I complain now,"]
, [Ye Sanshao also got up and wiped off the seawater on his body. "It's because of the ribs that it's so heavy."]
, [Cheng Anya continued to uphold the virtue of silence is golden, Black Hawk found two sets of clothes for them to change into, because the clothes were for men, it was very funny for Miss Cheng to wear them, so she simply wrapped herself with a blanket.]
, [As soon as she changed clothes, Black Hawk told her that Ningning wanted to talk to her.]
, [Cheng Anya snatched the microphone excitedly and said, "Baby, it's Mommy."]
"Hi, Mom, have you missed baby?"
Little Pack sits on the sofa, chatting with Cheng Anya with a smile on her face. She hasn't heard her mom's voice for a long time and feels strangely homesick.
"Not at all."
Cheng Anya snorted, showing a fierce tone, "You're too weak. It's so late to find Mom, you should be beaten."
Ning Ning thought of the promise, her heart choked, and smiled instead, "Okay, baby is ready to take the call, you can beat me however you want when you come back to Rome, I miss Mom very much, Mom, you are too not affectionate to me, I despise you."
"Despise back."
Cheng Anya laughed and asked worriedly, "Are you not hurt?"
"No, I'm fine, nothing happened, don't worry." Ning Ning smiled and said, "Mom, the plane is about to land, I'll talk to you later."
"Okay."
Little Pack turned off the communicator, Cheng Anya drank hot water to warm herself up, Ye San Shao originally stared eagerly to chat with his son, but he was disconnected before he could talk, he was very dissatisfied and looked at Cheng Anya with accusing eyes.
"Miss Cheng calmly ignored him, Black Hawk laughed and said, "Three, the plane is landing soon, we'll be able to see Young Master in a moment.""
"Three felt completely ignored, couldn't help but twist Miss Cheng, "Conscienceless little thing.""
"Cheapskate."
"Miss Cheng laughed and scolded, giving him hot water, Three drank the rest of the hot water in Miss Cheng's cup. It would be even more wonderful if there was a little alcohol to warm up."
"The plane landed soon, all landing in the castle, Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven, etc. were all there, when they saw Three and Miss Cheng were safe, everyone relaxed."
"Big brother Three, sister-in-law Three, it's really miserable..."
"Ye Wei laughed so much that her petals shook, "Big brother Three, I should take a picture as a souvenir.""
"Ugly girl."
"Three laughed and scolded, Wei Wei, Eleven and the little milk package were all safe, and he finally felt relieved."
"After so much effort, how can there be another accident?"
"The little milk bottle cheerfully wanted to hug Cheng Anya, but she sternly ordered him to stop. The little milk bottle then remembered that his mother was carrying a virus, as the Black Hawk had said, and then he watched his dad and mom holding hands, his heart sinking slightly. "
"Dad, Mom, you both... White Night, please help them take a look."
" The little milk bottle's first reaction was to find White Night. He was a genius doctor and there was no illness he could not cure. "
"Got it, got it, don't worry."
" White Night smiled. "
"Virus?"
" A blond, blue-eyed hunk blinked his eyes, ""Little White, isn't this your strong point?"
" Little White? 
White Night twitched his wrist, laughing with ease and warmth, ""Jason, try calling me Little White one more time?"" 
""... damn, why should I call you Little White? You're already Little White, and they still call you Black Jack Little Iron.""
Jason, who is known as the fire-breathing dragon, was shooting flames on the spot, like a golden-haired lion king, but just as handsome that both people and gods are angry.
Especially those pair of sky-blue eyes, shining like sapphires.
Launching into a rage, there was a chill-inducing aura, as if a volcanic eruption, with an exposed domineering quality.
Black Jack, a young man in his twenties, was delicate-looking, with a mixed background of Chinese and English. He had the mysterious features of an Eastern person and the depth of a Western person, with a pair of gray-blue eyes always hazy, giving a feeling of deep emotion, but upon closer inspection, you would find that he was extremely alert and had a hidden introverted quality.
The two leaders of the first terror organization were not very old, with contrasting personalities, but their aura was very powerful, with one person having the presence of a ruler over the world, not to mention the three great leaders were all here.
Looking at this row, there is a strong visual impact.
"Jason, you really need repairs."
Eleven hummed, "What's wrong with the name, call him Little White, Little White, beat him."
Ye Wei looked at them and shook her head, "Third Elder, Third Elder's wife, don't pay attention to them. You should take a hot bath first, then check later to avoid getting sick."
She called a maid to take Ye Chen and Cheng Anya to wash, although the little nanny wanted to follow, he still stayed here, White Night was about to beat someone, and the little nanny quickly pulled his sleeve.
"White night, can you find a way to save my dad and mom?"
"The child's eyes were bright, like two black grapes inlaid on a white and tender face, full of expectation. It seems that if White Night shakes his head, the light in his eyes will dim."
"Jason picked up the baby bag in his arms with great courage. "Baby, don't worry, White can even save dead people, let alone living ones. You're worried about nothing. Come over and knock out the black hand gang's protection when you have time.""
"Who just questioned White Night's medical skills?"
"Black Jack expressed his doubts, but Jason dodged his hand with agility."
"The baby bag was held by the tall man, and she was extremely entangled. She kicked Jason, "Put me down.""
"I also want such a son, Ning Ning, come and be my son? I've been drooling over you for a long time." Jason's blue eyes burst with dazzling light, as if the baby bag was just a piece of fat meat."
"Everyone, '...'"
"White Night smiled and said, "Jason, let your mom teach you some Chinese again. Don't always say that the commander doesn't know how to use words, or you won't go far.""
"I and the commander are not on the same level, right?"
"Jason is very unhappy that someone is linking him with the commanding officer, as the saying goes, "the enemy of the official is not the same household," this is a matter of principle."
"Jason let go of the little bun after a struggle, and the little bun asked, "White Night..."
"Ning Ning, wait until I give them a check-up to determine it. Don't be too hasty." White Night said, rubbing the head of the little bun. "I promise to do my best."
"The little bun just lost his promise and in a situation where his parents' life and death cannot be guaranteed, no matter how calm he is, he is still uneasy. He cannot lose them again. White Night understands his current state of mind very well."
"Don't worry too much," White Night said.
"It's done, leave it to White Night," said Ye Wei. "There's no problem in the world that can't be solved. If Louis can develop a virus, there must be an antidote. It's impossible to be unsolvable. If White Night can't solve it, take his sign."
Chu Li smiled, "I agree."
"Little White, do you have a sign?"
Jason expressed deep doubts, he never knew what his sign was.
Eleven wanted to punch him.
"Speaking of this, how come you two didn't catch Louis coming back?" Black Jack asked.
"This guy is dead, and we are at peace," said Black Jack.
"I have long wanted to kill him. Recently, the black hands have been provocating everywhere. This guy's headquarters has been bombed, but he still has the mood to play love, which is really enough to be dull."
"Louis is not in a hurry." Little Nurturer said slowly, with a dangerous arc on his face and calculating light in his black eyes. "Victory without war is the highest level of victory. He and we have a personal grudge, but the struggle between the black hands and terrorist organizations is another matter."
"To eliminate the black hands, we will definitely have to spend a lot of money and resources."
After this, his position in the black hands shook, and I have always suspected that there is a force hidden in a place where we can't see in the black hands. Otherwise, they would not let Louis take such self-destructive actions. Since this is the case, let Louis lead the way for us and uncover this force and eliminate it with one stroke."
"Deceitful..."
"This is the consensus of everyone."
"Although he always knows he is very evil and treacherous, because he is too young, people will inevitably spoil him, and coupled with a tender appearance, people will always overlook his essence."
"Evil!"
Jason raised his thumb high. He is always an action-oriented person who doesn't think much about the details like others. But most of the time, he would listen to the plans made by Black Jack and Chu Li.
He always follows the plans made by Little Milk Pudding without a second thought.
A real action-oriented person is always followed by a powerful group of advisors. This force is quite terrifying.
"I agree with Ning Ning's method," Chu Li said. He and Bai Ye always agree with his ideas. "It saves us the trouble of having someone who doesn't know the sky is high and the earth is thick, always coming to provoke us."
"Ning Ning, when have you ever rebutted, you traitor?"
Black Jack laughed, "But this time, we should indeed give the Mafia a lesson, so that they will avoid us for fifty years once they see us."
Bai Ye nodded. He had no objections. His main priority was to cure the virus on Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anyi. That was the most important thing. The rest could be left to Chu Li.
Ye Wei and Eleven exchanged a look. Another force?
They both had a face in mind, was it Mo Ye and Mo Jue?
In the Mafia, only they had enough charisma and were enigmatic. Besides them, they could not think of anyone else who could have such boldness. He was a man who should be superior to Louis, there was no reason why he should obey him.
Everyone moved to the living room, and Little Dumpling went to look for Cheng Anya. Just then she had finished taking a bath, had a cup of hot tea, her body was warm and her cheeks were pink. She was lying on the bed, looking at her fingers thoughtfully.
"Mommy..."
Little Dumpling pushed open the door and walked in with a smile.
Cheng Anya came back to her senses, squinted her eyes, praised, "Baby, you're really stylish."
This outfit is really powerful and doesn't have a hint of a child's taste. It's a dangerous person in its entirety.
"Thank you, Mommy, for praising me."
"Don't get too close, sit farther away, I'm afraid I can't resist hitting you."
Cheng Anya pointed to the sofa across from her, "Sit there."
Little Dumpling glared at Cheng Anya with resentment, "Mommy, you disdain me."
"Correct."
Cheng Anya laughed and looked at Little Dumpling, she always felt that there was something different about this child, although it didn't seem much different from the past, but the mother is the one who understands her child the most. No matter how well hidden, she can still feel it.
"Mommy, why are you looking at me like this? Do you think my baby is handsome?"
Little Dumpling blinked mischievously, with an adorable appearance.
Cheng Anya glanced at him with a smile and a frown, "You've learned your father's narcissistic skills pretty well. Are you okay lately? Tell me the truth, were you bullied?"
Little Dumpling shook his head, "No."
"Nonsense, Louis showed me the pictures, he was clearly beaten to a pulp."
Cheng Anya clearly didn't believe him, gritting her teeth, "I won't hate him even if he's slashed a thousand times."
Thinking about all that she had experienced, Cheng Anya hated Louis to the core.
Her bright face was clouded with a cold look, and when she thought about what Little Dumpling had gone through, she had an even worse premonition.
"Mommy, I'm really okay. Most of it was probably fabricated."
Little packets smiled elegantly, rolled up his sleeves, revealing a white and tender arm, "Look, there isn't a single scar."
The bullet wound on his arm healed quite well, and he soon wasn't afraid of being discovered by Cheng Anya.
And the whip wounds he had suffered were all left by Xu Promise, since it was Xu Promise who hit him, he didn't feel bullied, but instead, he missed the pain of being hit by her.
If Nuo Nuo could live, he would rather be beaten by her for the rest of his life.
"Ning Ning, are you really okay?"
Cheng Anya's brows tightened and she didn't miss the flash of pain in her son's eyes.
Little packets nodded, "I'm really okay, Mom, it's you and Dad who have the problem, Uncle Heiying said you have a virus and Dad got it too, how is that possible?"
Cheng Anya thought of the brain-filled Ye Sanshao, her cheek reddened again, she didn't even have the desire to speak, "Don't mention it, we jumped over a plane in the desert and another one at sea, how could we not get in contact?"
Miss Cheng spoke calmly, and Little packets didn't doubt her.
"Mom, it'll be okay, White Night's medical skills are so good, there must be a way to save you."
