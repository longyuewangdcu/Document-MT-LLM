At this time, the blue-silver-gold light array appeared, causing the flames to momentarily dim and be absorbed downwards. 
But the fire gourd was clearly not so easy to deal with, it violently inhaled upwards, actually taking some of the flames with it and then shot off to one side, breaking out of the range of the blue-silver-gold light array. 
These changes happened extremely quickly, leaving one feeling somewhat overwhelmed. 
This person is difficult to deal with! 
It must be taken down quickly, or the law enforcer will arrive. 
The fire gourd breathed out downwards, and the woman reappeared, with a fierce expression in her eyes, "What are you doing?" 
Just as she spoke, a circle of gorgeous light patterns quietly appeared under her feet, causing her body to suddenly stiffen. 
Tang Wu Lin's blue-silver grass quickly entwined upwards, while Ye Xing Lan's Star God Sword pointed forward and pointed at the opponent's chest. Xie Kai had already silently arrived behind her, with the Light Dragon Dagger placed on her neck. 
Everything is a trick! 
What is better than Xu Xiao Yan's Starlight Lock Chain for dealing with a single opponent?
"The absolute establishment of the Starlight Chain is an existence against heaven!"
"Just when everyone breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had defeated their opponent, an anomaly suddenly arose! The Star God Sword has already reached the front, and the sharp edge of the Light Dragon Dagger behind has already reached the neck. Under the threat of life, the woman's eyes suddenly brightened.
A clear phoenix cry rang out from her body, and then a fierce and unmatched soul power instantly burst out from within her. As if stimulated by something, under her clothes, a ring of fiery red light shone, which were halo-like, but looked like they were inside her clothes, respectively located at the neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, knees, etc. The next moment these fiery red light appeared, a formidable soul power suddenly burst out from the woman."
"It's unknown how many times stronger than before, the soul power surges, turning into a huge circle of fire ring, emitting a strong aura. A layer of fine golden lines appeared on the floating fire gourd in the air, and the originally only one-foot-high fire gourd directly rose to two feet, several times larger in size.
The powerful fire elemental fluctuations burst out in an instant, fiercely impacting and crashing Tang Wulin and several others out, and the flames also burned their soul power like maggots on bones.
The phoenix cries became increasingly bright, and the woman exuded a dignified aura. Immediately, pieces of dark red armor rapidly appeared, covering the whole body.
On the head is a phoenix helmet, covering the head, the dark red armor extends to both sides, the elegant streamlined shape extending downward in a curved shape, outlining the female's features, the soft lines covering the shoulders, covering the entire arm.
The dark red flame patterns are all over the armor, on the chest armor, there is a golden-red phoenix pattern, the armor is not particularly gorgeous, but when this armor is covered, the woman's aura has risen several levels.
Tang Wulin spoke out, and his face was already full of bitter smiles.
Battle armor, yes, that's the battle armor! Judging from its complexity and fluctuations in aura, it should be a one-word battle armor, the halo appearing on the woman's body is a tool for storing battle armor."
The one-word armor can't be integrated into the armor master's body yet.
But even so, this is a complete one-word armor!
This means that the original five-ring cultivation of the woman was directly lifted to the seven-ring realm.
Yan Feng was very angry at this time. She was in a particularly good mood today and was very happy. She just went to the Tiangong Transmission Tower to register, officially becoming a one-word armor master.
Armor masters are top-level existences that any organization is willing to provide for. Just when she signed the contract, the Tiangong Transmission Tower promised her a series of welfare policies. She is only 27 years old this year and is one of the youngest armor masters in Tiangong City. Her future is boundless.
Tiangong Tower has promised to assist her in providing a large amount of resources in the future and help her attack the two-word armor master. Once she becomes a two-word armor master, that will be the real armor master, with a place on the whole continent.
But who would have thought that as soon as she left the Tiangong Tower in high spirits, she was surrounded by a group of young guys not much older than herself.
And their abilities are quite strong. If they didn't use armor, they would have been defeated just now.
She doesn't know that Tang Wu Lin and others have no malicious intent. Star Sword and Light Dragon Dagger made her feel threatened by death.
At this time, the voice of Dancing in the Sky resounded in the ears of Tang Wu Lin and the other six, "As long as you defeat her, this city will be your pass."
Tang Wulin's mouth twitched, Dance teacher, you also have a dark side!
This is a complete state of a Douji Knight, equivalent to a strong one at the level of seven soul rings, can we win them?
Before he had time to think, Yanying had already acted. The powerful soul power rose instantly, his right hand pointed towards Tang Wulin, and a fire line burst out from the fire pot above his head, instantly reaching Tang Wulin's face.
Now that it has come to this, we can only try, explaining is undoubtedly useless. Look at the other person's eyes, you can tell that they have been angered.
They don't care about this! Respond first and then talk.
Tang Wulin took a deep breath, the three purple soul rings on his body suddenly disappeared, and a golden halo appeared, the halo shone, his right arm swelled, the golden dragon scales spread, and at the same time, a dazzling star line quickly condensed in his right hand, and the Douji gloves appeared.
How can he not go all out to deal with a real Douji Knight!
"Douji?"
Yanying was also shocked when she saw the Douji on Tang Wulin's right hand. What appeared in her mind instantly was the impossible three words!
How old is he?
And, she clearly saw that Tang Wulin's battle armor emerged directly from his body. Could he already have a two-word battle armor?
Although it's just a battle armor, to have a battle armor at this age is simply unimaginable.
When she first obtained the first battle armor, she was already 21 years old, which was even referred to as a genius.
These years have been a long and hard journey of training, and she finally became a true one-word battle armor master.
How old are these little guys in front of her?
As Tang Wulin made his move, others also quickly took action.
Xu Lizhi retreated far away earlier, and without saying much, a steamed bun shot out of his hand one by one, a light and small pork bun, a bloodthirsty red bean paste bun, one in each hand.
Tang Wulin had two buns in his left hand and had already caught them, without hesitation, he stuffed them into his mouth.
A quick resolution must be made.
Even if it's just a one-word battle armor, after collecting the full set, it has the ability to help the soul master recover soul power quickly.
"They have no chance in a prolonged battle against others."
"With a strong stomp on the ground with his left foot, Tang Wu Lin sprang into the air like a copper arrow, with his right arm guarding his front, his veins boiling and golden dragon king breath bursting out. His eyes turned completely golden and his body was filled with intense aura of blood. "
"With his golden dragon claw blocking in front of him, he pushed against the opponent's flame and pressed forward."
"As the leader and a strong attack-style soul master, he can't back down even a little bit. Only if he blocks the front, will his partners have a chance."
"Under the stimulation of the bloodthirsty dessert, his soul power and blood energy instantly erupted to the top, his skin showed faint golden scales, and his right hand, arm, and chest were particularly dazzling."
"Is he a dual-life soul?"
"Yan Feng was taken aback."
"Hmph!"
"She didn't dodge at all, the fire gourd on her head suddenly spun, and the original fire line became a large flame spray that swept over the top of Tang Wu Lin's head and covered his partners, blocking the others."
"She wanted to isolate Tang Wu Lin, first deal with this little guy who is obviously the opponent's leader, and then talk."
The golden dragon claws arrived in front of the opponent like a flash of lightning, and Yanyfeng's right hand was raised, clenched into a fist, and hard-hit front-on.
Just as the two sides were about to collide, the dragon roar within Tang Wulin's body suddenly became excited, and a massive golden dragon head with a diameter of over two feet appeared without any warning, directly devouring Yanyfeng's right arm.
Golden Dragon Astonishing!
After eating the Red Jade Shrimp that day, although Tang Wulin's own Qi and blood didn't break through the fourth sealing of the Golden Dragon King, there was still a very big improvement, which made him more skilled in controlling the Golden Dragon Astonishing.
Yanyfeng was also startled, she only felt a great force coming from the front, followed by her own punch, the flame was like being swallowed, the golden dragon claws were like a large pair of pliers, holding her right hand.
The golden dragon claws exerted force, and the one-word battle armor on Yanyfeng's body lit up, all the flame patterns on it seemed to come alive, especially the fire phoenix at the chest, which actually moved, turning into a phoenix fire shadow and rushing directly toward Tang Wulin's chest.
