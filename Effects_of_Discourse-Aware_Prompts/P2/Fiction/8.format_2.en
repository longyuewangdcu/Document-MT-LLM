After carefully looking over the house, and determining that there were no major problems, it was basically settled, and the remaining matters would be discussed with a real estate agent and the original owner by Nanfeng.
Today, Jianmao is in a great mood and went out to have a good time.
After swimming in the sea for a while and being called up on shore by Fangzhao, Jianmao played in the sand for a while and, when leaving, the dog kept its eyes on the car window, full of reluctance.
Nanfeng, seeing the situation, laughed, "Jianmao, don't worry, next time we come, you can live directly in the house. You can play as long as you want, and you can go swimming in the sea every day, and there will be little fish and shrimps to play with."
Jianmao was happy and lay in the car, starting to fantasize about his future happy life.
What is Jianmao's impression of the ocean?
The impression of a seafood buffet that is free.
Its cheerful mood continued until it returned to the dormitory.
After the three of Nanfeng left, Fangzhao closed the door to the dormitory and said, "Jianmao, come over."
Jianmao flicked its tail and went over.
"Did you have a good time today?"
Fangzhao asked.
"Wang!"
"Is it fun over there?"
Fangzhao asked again.
Jianmao jumped up and barked again, flicking its tail energetically.
"Speak."
"Fun!"
Jianmao said.
It can now switch languages fluently and speaks with standard pronunciation.
"Hmm."
Fang Zho nodded and then opened the learning machine.
"..."
With a twitch of its ears and a shrinking of its paws, the dog took a step back, thinking it was hiding.
Ignoring its retreat, Fang Zho opened the learning machine and showed it a newly created folder, containing newly purchased e-books -
"Marine Environmental Protection Law"
"Teenage Environmental Protection Knowledge Collection"
"Marine Wildlife Protection List"
"Marine Environmental Management"
"One Hundred Ocean Knowledge that Must be Understood in the New Century."
“The Ocean, My Home”
All books related to the ocean, a total of twenty.
Not only electronic books, but also accompanying test questions, twenty sets.
Curly: "..."
Its Pa excited ears drooped down.
"I know you read fast, should be faster now?"
"After finishing reading the twenty books in the folder and getting full scores for the corresponding twenty sets of test questions, I'll let you go play in the ocean."
"It's estimated to move over in less than fifteen days," said Fang Zao.
It's all rote knowledge, and it's not difficult to get full scores with Curly's memory and learning ability now.
When Curly goes to the ocean, Fang Zao is not worried about its safety, on the contrary, he is worried that Curly will eat some endangered species in the ocean to extinction.
What is the exact size of Jagged's stomach? It's still unclear even now that Fangzhao has arrived.
During the Port Star Records program, Jagged stole food in the desert and also in the sea, but due to Fangzhao's warning, Jagged did not really open his stomach to eat.
After all, Jagged's stay on Port Star is not long and he is also under Fangzhao's control, and he has to consider other people on Port Star, so he cannot eat too much even if he steals food.
But when they move to the new home, Jagged will have the opportunity to go to the sea every day without control, which would be equivalent to a species invasion, breaking the ecological balance of this sea area with the power of a dog.
Fangzhao needs to let Jagged know some things in advance, the marine life has not easily recovered to its current level, and cannot be destroyed by Jagged.
Don't think about going into the sea and continue to accompany the learning machine.
On this day, Nafeng came to find Fangzhao because of the matter of the new residence decoration.
As soon as he entered the dormitory door, Nafeng saw Jagged meditating, hanging his head, with tears in his eyes under his dog eyes.
Nafeng's footsteps stalled, he moved his gaze away, went to find Fangzhao, and first solved the matter at hand.
As for Jagged's side, this is normal, and Nafeng has already learned to deal with it calmly.
After talking about the renovation, Nanfeng remembered something he saw today and said, "By the way, boss, do you know about the online thing today?"
What thing?
Fang Zhen was writing a thesis today, and his communication settings were set up, so he wouldn't be disturbed by anything unimportant.
There have been a lot of online topics and people looking for him lately, so Fang Zhen had to set his phone to "Do Not Disturb" mode.
Do you know about Will's painting?
Nanfeng asked.
I know, is it about Will's graduation work?
Fang Zhen has seen Will's graduation painting exhibition, and it received an A+. One of the paintings was of a shaggy dog, named "The Neighbor's Dog."
The painting exhibition has already been over for two days, and Fang Zhen has been writing a thesis in his dorm since this morning, so he really doesn't know what happened online.
Nanfeng told Fang Zhen what he had learned.
Originally, after Will's graduation painting exhibition ended, the academy displayed his paintings on the school website, causing a heated discussion.
Will successfully completed his training plan that he formulated last year - the short-term goal was to paint Fang Zhai, and the final goal was to paint a dog of Fang Zhai.
The short-term goal was completed long ago. Will's "My Neighbor" originally caused a stir on the internet, and there were also jokes from netizens saying that Will painted Fang Zhai like an alien.
This time, following "My Neighbor", "The Dog of the Neighbor's Home" once again topped the hot search list of the day.
"The Dog of the Neighbor's Home" is Will's longest and most time-consuming work during his training period, and also the one he is most satisfied with.
This painting is similar in style to Will's previous work "My Neighbor", but it looks more difficult to understand. "My Neighbor" can still show some personal style, but "The Dog of the Neighbor's Home" cannot show any dog-like features, unless one sees the name of the painting, no one would think that the picture is a dog, or a pet dog.
With vivid color rendering, mysterious and containing a great aura, it seems too extraordinary and unconventional, but it cannot be said where it is not appropriate. The more one studies it, the more a feeling of tremble will arise from the bottom of one's heart.
"Is Fang Zhai's dog that scary?"
A student at the Royal Art Academy remembered the little curly-haired dog she had encountered in the campus after seeing this painting, and searched online for Fang Zhai's dog to make sure she was not mistaken.
On the other hand, at the Royal Art Academy, after listening to Fang Zhai's graduation concert and closely analyzing Will's painting, there was a different impression.
"To be honest, this painting gives me a similar feeling as Fang Zhaos's song "η".
"It's a bit beyond the ordinary person's understanding."
"Even if a layman stands in front of this painting and quietly looks for a few seconds, even if they don't understand it, they will have an uncomfortable feeling in their heart and their body will not be able to resist shivering."
"Online, the discussion is even more intense."
"I found that after studying, Will's completely let go and his thoughts roam freely, not something I can understand."
"What grudges and resentments! How could Fang Zhao paint a dog like this!"
"The friend in front probably hasn't seen Will's previous work, "My Neighbor," go take a look and see how Will paints Fang Zhao."
"Maybe Will was bitten by a dog and has a psychological shadow towards dogs, otherwise he wouldn't be able to paint something so scary!"
"A cute little thing is painted into a monster!"
"This is called art!"
"The world of artists is indeed not something that ordinary people like us can understand."
"To be fair, I stared at the painting for five minutes and still couldn't understand what he was trying to express, but it still felt amazing and left a strange feeling in my heart."
"This kind of painting that belongs to a deeper level needs to be studied carefully."
"This painting won't sell well, right?"
"You can also buy it back to ward off evil spirits."
"It's still worth investing in, I'm optimistic about the artist Will, he's still young."
"In fact, after Will's paintings were displayed on the school website, people started looking for him to buy his paintings."
"Finally, a collector from Mùzhōu bought the painting "The Neighbor's Dog" for a high price, far exceeding the estimated price of the Imperial Art Gallery."
"Some people think that the collector from Mùzhōu is too fanatical about curly hair, and when faced with curly hair, people from Mùzhōu always seem to be insufficiently calm."
"Others believe that this is pure speculation, not for Will as a person or for Fang Zhaotiao's dog, people from Mùzhōu are indeed incomprehensible when it comes to things related to dogs, as if they've lost their minds."
In response, the Imperial Television Station's calligraphy and painting channel sent someone to interview the person who bought the painting at a high price.
During the interview, Muzhou collector stated, "Many people buy Wil's paintings, but they only invest in Wil himself, not the paintings."
"I am different, I look at the paintings, and of course the dog in the paintings."
"I have a feeling that this painting will be worth a fortune in the future."
Seeing the interview live, Little Bear said, "Muzhou people really have a terrible intuition about dogs."
"Human beings are indeed peculiar creatures."
As a result, because of Wil's "The Dog at the Neighbor's House," Fluffy also made it to the hot search list and appeared on the Imperial News Headlines.
After Nanfeng left, Fang Zhaofan looked up the news online and said to Fluffy, "You don't need to go out these days, just stand there for five minutes and go back to reading."
"You only got 62 on the morning test, go back and read the section on protecting animals two more times!"
"Is whale meat even edible!"
"Coral can't be eaten either!"
