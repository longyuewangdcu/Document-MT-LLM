"This is to let you feel the fluctuations of breath, it's really simple." Another wizard nearby couldn't help but interject with a smile.
"Thank you."
Lin Sheng nodded.
He needed to find the other fragments as quickly as possible. He originally planned to capture more evil spirits from the government to gain more pure soul power.
But now that he has encountered this opportunity, it is the best way to get it in his hands as quickly as possible.
Soon, the wizard led Lin Sheng to stand in front of an evil spirit gate.
The two of them reached out and gently touched the frame of the evil spirit gate, closing their eyes.
The wizard quickly used his ability to build a spatial foundation as a coordinate.
Then, following the ritual fluctuations of the evil spirit gate, he took Lin Sheng's perceptual consciousness with him and was launched out by the ritual fluctuations.
"A normal teleportation ritual is a point-to-point directional teleportation."
"But we generally explore other spatial secrets by transforming this point-to-point into point-to-many."
"This can be done simply by modifying a few small parameters on the teleportation pedestal."
The sorcerer leads Lin Sheng's consciousness while imparting related skills.
"In this way, the evil gate will spontaneously transmit our consciousness to multiple potential places in similar target spaces."
"This is actually a matter of luck with energy, if we are lucky, we can hit the desired spatial secret with just one shot, if we are unlucky, we have to waste more energy and try several times."
"It's really random enough."
Lin Sheng is speechless.
His perception enters the evil gate and is immediately enveloped by the ritual fluctuations and sent out.
At the same time, he seems to have split his consciousness and his perceptions are divided into more than ten parts, while he perceives more than ten completely different spatial atmospheres.
"Generally speaking, our consciousness is hard to maintain integrity during the transmission process, so we can only try to remember the spatial coordinates that the main consciousness comes into contact with."
"The coordinates of memory require us to leave a simple mark."
"The sorcerers outside are still explaining in a low voice while guiding Lin Sheng, teaching him how to make a simple mark to determine the coordinate code."
"But he never thought that the consciousness of the soul lock, due to its strong and stubborn nature, would be split off and that he would be able to remember the coordinates of all the spaces that more than ten conscious souls came into contact with."
"However, it's just one mind with more than ten uses. For Lin Sheng, who can use his soul consciousness with one mind N times, this is nothing. He exercises his skills of one mind dozens of uses every day."
"He can observe every summoned creature by controlling the divided soul consciousness. So now, although he can't control many summoned creatures to act independently at the same time, 
he just remembers the breath fluctuation and sets the coordinates separately."
"Additionally, his own soul is more stubborn and has a longer existence time than ordinary people. This is still very easy."
"Ten minutes later. The consciousness is exhausted and dissipates."
"Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the sorcerers."
"“Locate the secret space of this coordinate for me.” Under the gaze of the sorcerers and others who were speechless, he immediately said one of the special secret space coordinates."
"This coordinate space secret realm is exactly what Lin Sheng sensed and has a special space that is of the same origin as the Yin-to-Evil Wheel fragments in his arms."
"Did it succeed in one go?"
"The sorcerer felt a bit bitter. The first time he sensed the space's breath, he determined the coordinate and recorded it, but it took him more than half a month to succeed."
"It's a very simple operation."
"Start, establish a teleportation gate."
"I want to go over." Lin Sheng instructed.
"Yes."
"Wait for the entity."
Tian Gongxia's soul transmitted a voice, causing Lin Sheng's actions to stall.
"What?"
"He watched as the sorcerer and others began to command the evil spirits to move materials and resources over, waiting on the side, and communicating telepathically with Tian Gongxia in his mind."
"There's a situation here. It's different from the situation on Shajia Island. Something big has changed!"
"Tian Gongxia's tone was slightly serious."
"This was something that Lin Sheng had never seen before."
"It must be known that even when he told Tian Gongxia about the existence of the King of the Night, he had never seen her so serious."
"This made him feel a hint of unusual nervousness."
"Shouldn't Miyue be in a definite disadvantage?" 
Lin Sheng asked with a frown.
"Or is there a new fighting force?"
"No, not a new fighting force." Tian Gongxia said solemnly.
"But Moon Fooled everyone!"
"What's going on?"
"The Seven-Locked Tower has been successfully summoned, Moon Fooled everyone from the three secret realms, he had already successfully summoned Farudo and merged with him using himself as a sacrifice!"
Lin Sheng's consciousness was stagnant for a moment.
"As a sacrifice?"
"This crazy guy..."
"So, now the three secret realms are facing a fusion monster of Moon and Farudo."
Lin Sheng had no words.
"What should we do now?"
Tian Gongxia said seriously.
The combination of Farudo and Miyue is not as simple as one plus one equals two, but rather a result of three times ten.
“Don't get excited.”
“For Miyue and Farudo, the greatest enemies are still the three secret realms and many other major forces.”
“And this world is not as simple as you think.”
Lin Sheng remembered the investigations he conducted and the information he obtained.
“The Star Pool and those who hold the artifacts of heavenly fate are not simple characters.”
“As long as they don't come to provoke us, we don't care how they develop.”
“I understand what you mean.”
“But it's still best to be prepared early.” Tian Gongxia reminded.
“I once had that level of destructive power. It was during the period when I was manipulated by the demon sword.”
“So I'm very clear on what kind of results that level of power will lead to.”
Lin Sheng remained silent.
Among all of his subordinates, Tiangong Xia is the most special one. Because Tiangong Xia has been influenced and controlled by some kind of unique and powerful existence.
At that time, she even found Lin Sheng's scrutiny in the memory recall.
Just a shadow of memory, and it can still find Lin Sheng who was peeking at the memory.
Such power has already exceeded Lin Sheng's understanding.
“I understand.” Lin Sheng answered again.
“I'll be ready.”
“Don't worry.”
At worst, activate the most powerful special state, summon all the power of the subordinates, and integrate it into oneself.
[Disconnecting from Tiangong Xia, Lin Sheng gazed quietly at the newly constructed evil spirit gate. His thoughts returned to the original plan.]
"It's open. Upstairs." The wizard said in a low voice. 
Lin Sheng gazed at the teleportation gate, silent for a moment.
"Let the fairy king come. Also, Dekaler!"
Dekaler's magic hand was already waiting nearby.
Hearing the summon, he immediately walked into the door.
"Respectful, follow your orders." 
Lin Sheng nodded. 
"I want to open multiple teleportation gates at the same time and explore multiple evil spirit spaces." 
"You choose one hundred big evil spirits and divide them into different number of teams, exploring separately." 
“Understood!”
The magic hand of De Galle was solemn, knowing that it was probably a turning point for the supreme being.
Otherwise, it wouldn't suddenly be so urgent and massive to explore.
