Xiao Mo had a moment when her heart and soul were in turmoil and she felt sadness.
The master must be... afraid to move.
Once his body moved, his mind would start to move too, and he was so clever, how could he not know that Bai Wei Wei was already dead.
He didn't want to admit it, nor did he dare to think deeply about it, he could only force himself to sit there, convincing himself that Bai Wei Wei was just sleeping and would wake up.
Xiao Mo felt that only when Bai Wei Wei's body began to rot would the master truly regain his sanity and realize that the person he was holding hands with had been dead for a long time.
But strangely, Bai Wei Wei's body showed no change.
Even her pale face looked better, her body was still cold, but she was undoubtedly sleeping.
There was no trace of any dead body characteristics.
Mu Yanjun guarded her, and his eyes became brighter.
The infamous old doctor was finally brought in, he ate the heart-protecting pill, "I guess my old life is already gone by half."
Muyan Jun has been awake for five days and anyone can see that he is physically exhausted.
However, his entire person is abnormally clear and awake, frighteningly so.
"After she ate the medicine I gave her, she fell asleep like this. I think it's time for you to come and see when she will wake up."
The old doctor sighed and walked to the bedside to take the pulse of Bai Weiwei.
"In fact, this phenomenon is extremely rare and there is no need for treatment, but there is still one important thing that needs to be done..."
Muyan Jun listened attentively, like a good student, his eyes burning like a blazing fire.
The old doctor's voice dropped low, "I have to treat another person again..."
Muyan Jun leaned forward, not wanting to miss a word of what he was saying.
But then, the old doctor's movements were like lightning, instantly injecting him with a needle into his neck.
Muyan Jun's eyes suddenly widened, and his hand reached out to slap the old doctor's celestial cover.
Xiaomo's hand suddenly shot out and grabbed Muyuan's attack.
In this back-and-forth, Muyuan could no longer hold on and passed out from dizziness.
Old Zao touched his head and said, "I almost died, but I probably won't live much longer anyway. It would be good if he wakes up without going crazy."
Bai Weiwei can't be saved.
Muyuan's condition is simply heartbreaking. All of his internal organs have problems.
He doesn't eat, sleep, think, or move, like a dead person. If he lasts another two days, he'll probably be gone just like Bai Weiwei.
Xiaomo looked at Old Zao and said, "You're responsible for protecting my master's life. If you can't protect it this time, I'll kill you with my own hands."
After saying this, she turned and went to where they enforce punishment, silently accepting the punishment.
Old Zao sighed and said, "No wonder my master said that being a potato seller is better than being a god doctor. Everyone treats me like a god, but even gods can't save a person who wants to die."
Muyuan only slept for two hours, and his eyes opened.
He was taken aback and his eyes showed a rare panic, but he found that he couldn't move.
The old man saw that he had woken up and said, "I'll give you an acupuncture needle. Your mind and spirit are both weak, but if I nurse you, you'll go to see the king of hell."
Muyun's eyes darkened and his face became pale and haggard, but he was full of viciousness, making people feel uneasy just by looking at him.
The old man gave him another needle, "I didn't want to save you originally. After all, you are a cruel and evil person. If I save you, who knows what kind of chaos this world will turn into."
Muyun's voice was soft and eerie, "Let me go."
The old man shook his head, "That's not possible. I can't save the life of a heart-piercing person like you. If I save you, it's considered a compensation."
Muyun suddenly laughed tragically, "You can't compensate. How can you compensate? Even if you save all the people in the world, you can't compensate for a single hair of hers." He has escaped.
