The wind blew through the canyon and stirred up ripples across the prairie.
The wild ox, which had been bending down and eating the tender grass leaves, raised its head, looking towards the sky.
There, a wooden merchant vessel dozens of meters long was suspended in the air, its fully stretched sails drumming up in the wind, slowly moving forward.
No matter when you look, the spectacle of this trend remains impressive.
The middle-aged man wearing leather armour stood by the deck, overlooking the boundless grassland and beautiful scenery below.
For us merchants, this is also a rare business opportunity.
Standing next to the middle-aged man was an slightly plump businessman with peculiar curls, wearing a long robe of a businessman. His small eyes narrowed slightly, as if he was calculating something while observing the scenery in front of him. His appearance seemed to suggest that even the beautiful scenery in front of him could be sold for money.
Without it, it's unlikely that we would be able to transport the goods to the Central region so quickly.
To be honest, when I initially planned to expand this market, there was opposition, but now it looks like my choice was indeed correct.
However, to be frank, if you choose not to take the large route, but instead take a shortcut from here, it would be quicker although more dangerous.
I heard that the other side is not peaceful lately. Moreover, I think you must have heard the captain's reminder too, that there seem to be wind-snakes around here recently. Heaven forbid...
The man's face became somewhat solemn, and he turned his head, casting his gaze towards the mountains not far away.
The towering mountain peaks blocked his view, so he couldn't see what was behind.
But faintly visible, the sky in the distance is not purely azure blue, but with a touch of gloomy darkness.
That is not a world they should get involved in.
"Don't worry, it is highly unlikely for misfortune to be in the midst of wealth and honor, which is why I spent so much money on hiring you!"
"It's just a few snakes, isn't it?"
The merchant reached out and patted the man's shoulder.
"Right, how is the young person we rescued doing now?"
"Not dead yet, right?"
Lijie has already bandaged his wound, and now he is in a coma, so there shouldn't be any life-threatening danger.
That's good.
Upon hearing the man's response, the merchant nodded satisfactorily, though soon afterwards he furrowed his brow.
But what wound has that youth received? From what it looks like, it seems to be a large lizard- though does the northern Pfirdend have such a peculiar creature?
I'm not sure either, sir, but it should be a very fierce beast. Let's hope we don't run into it.
As he spoke, the man unconsciously glanced at the entrance of the cabin, then he turned his head back and looked forward.
Roder opened his eyes.
What happened?
He blankly stared at the ceiling in front of him and his mind became dull.
He remembered that he had led the team on the ruins of the high platform and fought with the strongest boss, the Void Dragon, in the Dragon Soul continent before and succeeded to get the first kill. He was sure he got achievement and system alert, and then the last strike of the Void Dragon also took him away life.
Originally according to the plan, Rhoad should have resurrected in the cemetery and then logged out.
But just as he was killed by the Void Dragon, the whole world immediately became pitch black, as if it had been forcibly separated. Then, Lorde lost consciousness.
How could this be possible?
Is there a problem with the game?
Roder reluctantly turned his head, and he could see the blue sky and white clouds outside the window. Where was he?
What place is this?
What exactly happened?
He is still dreaming?
Still in the game by yourself?
At least, Rod could be certain, this place definitely wasn't his cramped rental apartment.
Upon thinking of this, doubts immediately surged into Rod's mind, he furrowed his brows then proceeded to try and sit up.
Woe!!
At that moment, a sharp pain suddenly came from Rod's chest; He gritted his teeth and stopped moving.
At this time, Roder felt that his left shoulder and chest were completely wrapped in bandages. Although he didn't know what had happened, from the bloodstains that were seeping out of them, it was obvious he had suffered a serious injury.
This is definitely not a game!
Rod can be sure of this, that even though technology is now quite advanced, and Long Hun Dia Lu, the world's first virtual MMORPG, uses quite a lot of high-tech technology. But according to the rules, players are not able to experience pain, this is to make it easier to distinguish between reality and the game, as well as to lower the threshold for players.
When a player is injured, instead of replicating pain, the game uses a series of ways to disrupt the player's normal game play such as lowering their movement speed, obscuring their vision with a red color to represent danger, as warnings and reminders, instead of actually simulating pain.
This kind of behavior caused a considerable amount of debate in society when holographic simulated technology first appeared, and naturally the operators of Dragon Soul Continent were not unaware of this.
Rod lowered his head and stared at his right hand, which was not the character he had created in the game, not the muscular and wild figure.
On the contrary, the arm in front of us is thin and weak, because it has not been exposed to sunlight for a long time, and the skin is somewhat sickly pale.
This is his own body in reality, and he is very aware of this.
But, how did I get hurt?
And moreover, it doesn't look like a hospital here?
Raode looked up, the whole room appeared to be a cabin–there were no lights, no phone and certainly no call bell.
A wooden table, two chairs and a cabinet fixed against the wall is all the furniture here.
Rod couldn't understand why he felt like he had seen this scene somewhere before.
Just as Rod was carefully examining the room, the door suddenly opened.
A golden-haired girl wearing a white robe walked into the room, she looked at Rod half-sitting up with widening eyes, somewhat surprised.
Are you awake? That's great!!
The girl was not speaking Chinese or English, yet lode understood clearly what she meant.
This surprised Rod, as he knew this language.
This is Nimeese, one of the official languages of Dragon Soul Continent!
How does it feel? Is it still okay?
But the girl did not pay attention to Rodney's expression, she quickly walked to Rodney's side, and carefully inspected his left shoulder and chest.
Your injury is really serious, frankly speaking, I'm worried you won't be able to hold on...
This is...
Rod frowned, not knowing what to say. He turned his head, looking at the mirror on the wall next to him. His face was clearly reflected there and it was indeed his face - but it shouldn't have been here.
Have you forgotten?
The blond girl blinked her eyes questioningly, her pigtails swaying slightly, her sky blue eyes bright and clear, giving the impression of liveliness.
Two days ago, you fell in the Parfeild Mountains and suffered a quite severe injury.
If it wasn't for the cargo ship from the 'Silver Firmament' Merchant Union passing by, it probably would have been quite bad.
I really don't know what you're fighting, your left side is severely injured, it was really dangerous at that time.
Wait a minute, left shoulder?
Roder was stunned for a moment, then he remembered that during the final battle with the Void Dragon, his left side had been attacked, hadn't it?
But that was the character in the game being injured, and it should not be related to the player himself, right? But now, the one who was injured was him personally?
Although the situation before him was chaotic, it didn't take Rod long to calm down, this is a testament to his mental quality as a top-tier player and the leader of the world's most powerful gaming guild.
In his conversation with the blonde girl in front of him, Rod also found out his current situation - he was heavily wounded and lying in the Pfalz Plains, and the airship from the Silver Sky Commerce Guild just happened to pass by and rescued him.
According to the blonde girl, Rod's situation was not optimistic at first, but his recovery ability was quite good.
My name is Lijie. I'm a member of the Star Moon Mercenary Group, a spiritualist. Just call me Lijie.
The girl gave a big and confident introduction of herself to Lorde.
My name is Roderick Aylant.
Although he couldn't arrange the current situation, Rodelay still hesistated for a moment before reporting his identity and ID in the game.
He is an adventurer from the Eastern Mountains.
"So that's why you are all alone in a faraway deep mountain, adventurer."
Upon hearing Rod's response, Lijie was not surprised, for on this continent, many adventurers prefer to explore alone, so Rod's identity posed no major problem.
"But, what exactly are you fighting for?"
Why did you receive such a severe injury?
I remember in this plain area, there should be nothing particularly scary monster.
Hearing the young girl's inquiry, Lorde smiled awkwardly.
What could he say to Lijie? That he was injured while fighting one of the five dragons known as the Void Dragon?
Because I was attacked at night, I couldn't see clearly what the other side was, they were numerous and moved fast, I think they might be something from ‘over there’.
I understand.
Although Rod did not explain in detail, Lejie seemed to understand something and nodded slightly, then after carefully examining Rod's wounds, she stood up.
You haven't eaten in two days, I'm sure you're very hungry. Please wait a moment, I will go and get something to eat right away.
"Oh right, I also need to report this to the team leader, I think he will come to see you soon."
After speaking these words, the girl politely nodded slightly to Lord Rod and then turned to leave the room.
