This is exactly what Song Fu and others wanted to ask, but it was asked first. We looked at each other, not knowing what to do, where to answer from.
Miao Yi flew headlong towards the source of the thunderous sound, and Yan Xiu and the other two followed immediately.
Song Fu and the others exchanged a glance, and followed to take a closer look.
Upon arrival of the group at the mountain gate, the stone carving of 'Donglai Cave' could be seen broken into pieces beneath the moonlight. This shocked everyone, who couldn't believe that someone had destroyed the mountain gate to Donglai Cave.
Miao Yi abruptly turned back, his face staring ferociously at Song Fu and the others, ceaselessly coldly chuckling: "Good!"
I just arrived today, looks like someone can't wait to give me a hard time!
Very good!
Song Fu and the others were stunned, they understood the meaning in the other's words, but this certainly wasn't something they did, because just now they were sitting and having a small gathering and discussion how to deal with Miao Yi in the future when they heard the unusual noise and then came out.
A few people still suspected that it was Miao Yi and his group that had done it. Seeing Miao Yi's appearance, they felt that there was no need for him to smash his own mountain gate to look bad, after all, he was the master of Donglaidong and it would be quite embarrassing if his signboard was smashed right after he came into office.
This kind of thing definitely needs to be said clearly, otherwise once it comes out, we cannot take responsibility for it. Song Fuzheng bowed with a fist and said, "Host, this was not done by us!"
The others followed suit and also kowtowed, as if it was the first time they treated Miaoyi as a true village head.
Sophistry!
Miao Yi stared at Song Fuli and said, "I only assigned you to guard the mountain gate today. Would you not know if someone destroyed it?"
Isn't it on purpose that you are letting it slip?
"This..."
Song Fu finished speaking, he was not here from the start anyway, so now he could not say with assurance that he didn't take the cave master seriously, and could only bow respectfully and say: "The Cave Master probably didn't know the situation when he first arrived, so the miscellaneous duties from the East Coming City have yet to be sent, and I had to take care of my own food and drink, so I temporarily left for a while to find something to eat, and didn't expect this kind of thing happened."
Prince Fa and others also bowed in turn and said, "Master, we can prove that Song Fushi was just having a meal with us."
Miao Yi pointed to the fallen pagoda and shouted angrily, "Don't tell me it just fell by itself. Don't you dare tell me it was blown over by the wind!"
Song Fu was too dumbfounded to even speak and had to raise his hand and say: "Respected Elder, I swear upon the teachings of my Blue Jade Sect's predecessors that this was not our doing. If I tell even a single lie, may I, Song Fu, incur a terrible fate!"
Miao Yi's eyes gleamed uncertainly as he surveyed the crowd, his tone ominous as he asked,"Is anyone coming to cause trouble in my Donglai Cavern?"
Everyone was taken aback, and it really was possible, so they all quickly looked around.
What are you still waiting here for? Do you want to be strangled in your sleep?
Move away and search now!
Miao Yi roared angrily.
Yan Xiu and three others bowed in response and then quickly dispersed into the surrounding mountains and forests.
Hmm?
Miao Yi snorted heavily, his gaze fixed on Song Fu and the others, as if questioning, "Since you didn't do it, why didn't you go search? Is it because you know something?"
At this moment, Song Fuli had to make a show of proving that he and the others had nothing to do with this, and he immediately turned around and roared: "Why aren't you going to search as commanded by the Master of the Cave?!"
Everyone bowed to Miao Yi and immediately dispersed.
However, Song Fu was stopped by Miao Yi, "Song Fu, come with me!"
Song Fu Zheng was stunned and bowed, then followed behind Miao Yi.
After everyone left, a phantom like a water-person appeared on the spot, none other than the graceful figure of Old Bai.
Only seeing the fallen stone monument plaque, the old man shook his head slightly and smiled lightly: "The world is like chess, how could the brave man only have the courage of a knight!"
I have always worried that you are too kind, easily taken advantage of...A real man should have fortitude, a simple and unlettered man can't make it in this world, but now I feel more at ease.
When the words finished, the entire figure started to sway like the waves, and quietly disappeared without a trace.
As the flickering lights and shadows at the great hall illuminated it, Song Fu followed Miao Yi, standing straight behind him one in front and one behind inside the hall. The charcoal outside seemed to have stood up as if it had sensed something and sneezed.
Miao Yi stared expressionlessly at his throne, standing with his back to Song Fu, without saying a word.
The atmosphere between the two was a bit suppressed; Song Fu waited for a while until he couldn't help but ask, "What does the master of the cave want me for?"
Miao Yi said gloomily: "Song Fu, do you know your offense?"
Song Fu sneered and glanced at the wine and dishes on the small table next to him, saying lightly, "This is none of our doing, what crime has Song Fu committed?"
I'm not asking this!
Miao Yi abruptly turned around and stared at him, coldly asking one word after another: "I ordered you to watch over the mountain gate, why did you neglect your duty? Is it that you do not take my commands as a Cave Master seriously?"
Song Fuxin was wondering, what do you think?
It never mattered in the first place.
Of course, I wouldn't say it out loud - "Song Fu has already reported to the cave master, and although I'm forced to do this, I don't want to see this happen."
Miao Yi asked, "Do you think that the Governor and the Mountain Master will believe your explanation after it is reported?"
Song Fu laughed and said, "People have two mouths; if the lord of the cave insists on framing me, Song, then please go ahead. But don't forget, I also have a mouth to defend myself against accusations, not to mention I am not mute."
Miao Yi gave a knowing smirk and said, "It looks like you really aren't going to repent!"
As soon as the words were spoken, Yan Xiu, Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaogong all rushed to the door, saluted Miao Yi and said, "Cave Master, no suspicious persons were found for the time being."
Miao Yi said, "The suspect is right in front of us, how come we canâ€™t find it!"
Dan Biao-yi and Qiu Shao-qun seemed to get a secret signal, quickly disappearing and closing the palace gate.
Song Fu was taken aback by the sound, quickly turning around only to see a God of Death-like Yan Xiu's double axes chopping fiercely towards him.
Song Fu hurriedly drew his sidearm sword, a cold gleam came out of the sheath as he quickly brought it up to block.
Dan Biao Yi and Qiu Shaoqun almost unsheathed their swords and attacked Song Fu jointly in an instant.
Yen Hsieu and Song Fu's cultivation are almost the same, their powers were originally evenly matched. With Dan Biau-I and Chiou Shau-Chun joining forces, Song Fu's situation became precarious in an instant.
"Shameless thief!"
"Dare not to plot any harm..."
Surrounded and unable to escape, Song Fu had not yet finished his sorrowful and angry cries of resistance before two bullets pierced through his magical defences and viciously pierced his chest.
Song Fu widened his eyes and tried to look back at Miao Yi, his lips trembling, and the anger in his eyes could not be described.
He finally understood that it was a trap. Not only was the collapsing mountain signboard going to be used to incriminate him, but also his fellow apprentices were going to be relocated to prevent him from uniting forces with them. In the end, the main purpose was to take his life.
