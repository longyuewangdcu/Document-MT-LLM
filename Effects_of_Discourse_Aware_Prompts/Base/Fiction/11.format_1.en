At the East Campus?
Zhou Tu hesitated for a moment, both senior students and teachers had warned the new students not to get close to the Eastern School Zone, they hadn't given any specific reasons, but from the tone of their voices it was clear that the Eastern School Zone was very dangerous.
You have a deep misunderstanding of the East campus, it's actually not much different from here, it's only the two campuses have totally different management styles, they live in true terror, while you all live in false bliss.
Chen Ge watched Zhou Tu's eyes: "Compared to you guys, they are actually closer to hope, because at least they know who they are, and know a way out."
Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu, regardless of the students from the East Campus or the West Campus, they were all trapped in the school.
The memories of the students in the western school district have been modified, repeating the life created by the hidden hands behind the scenes; while the students in the eastern school district, at least, know how to find a proxy for the dead, and try to find ways to leave.
Are students at East School closer to their hopes?
I heard that only the waste from the western campus will be sent there.
Zhou Tu has been moved, but he still feels a bit doubtful in his heart.
No matter what the judging criteria is, any school that treats its students like garbage is surely a garbage school.
Chen Ge pointed to the tall wall between the two campuses: "Do you know why that wall exists?"
Why?
The school was afraid of losing control, so they used various methods to reshape human nature, but they forgot that human nature is the most complex thing in the world.
The thing has already happened and no matter how hard we try to forget, the scars will remain etched in our hearts.
"Just because you don't remember doesn't mean they don't exist, so certain plans of this school are doomed to fail."
Chen Ge was saying something that some of the club members couldn't understand; they had no idea why Chen Ge was saying it, but they felt that there might be some truth in what Chen Ge was saying.
The children's curiosity is heavy enough, and Chen Ge constantly tells them the truth of the school, eventually successfully arousing the interest of the club members.
"Shall we go now?"
"To be honest, I really don't believe it, there's actually a painting room in the East Campus just like the one in my dreams," said Zhou Tu in a soft voice.
Now is not the right time.
Chen Ge turned and looked at the shadow, the dark figure in Room 413 was still asleep, but his body had changed greatly.
If you look closely, you'll find that Chen Ge's shadow is different from everyone else's. It's jet black, as if every ray of light that hits it will be devoured.
It seems to have become much stronger.
This is good news for Chen Ge, that Shadow has great potential. When he awakens, Chen Ge will lead the students back to the East School District to take on the lost ghost again.
Doing this can enhance one's own strength, and second, it can stir up the stagnant waters of the school, covering up the other "culprit" in the college.
It is still the stage for me to build up my strength, and before the schoolmaster finds me, I will do my best to prepare as many backup plans for myself as possible.
Chen Ge turned to look at Wang Yicheng, he had learnt the story of the other three club members, there was only this first lamed boy left: "Our next destination is Wang Yicheng's dormitory."
"Go to my dorm?"
Wang Yicheng reacted strangely after hearing it. He shook his head repeatedly: "Forget it. There's nothing much to see at my dormitory."
When you said this sentence, your voice was louder than usual, your speaking speed was faster and your eyes were unsteady. It seems that you are not good at lying.
Chen Ge hugged Wang Yicheng's shoulders lightly: "Why don't you want us to go?"
Are you worried about what we will see?
I...
Wang Yicheng thought for a while but didn't know what to say, so he eventually shifted his gaze to the other direction: "Nothing, let's go directly."
Good.
Wang Yicheng lives in Room 413 of the West Campus dormitory, and Lin Sisi lives in Room 413 of the East Campus dormitory.
The dormitory numbers are exactly the same, but in the 413 dormitory in the West Campus, except the fourth bed, there are students living in the other beds, while in the East Campus it is just the opposite, only the fourth bed has someone living in it, and the other beds are all empty.
"Keep the secrets of our club to ourselves, try to be low-key, there are teachers in this school who are just like me, and some who are not so friendly with their words."
Chen Ge always kept on guard. The commotion made by them in the experimental building was too loud, and the school was likely already starting an investigation.
The time I have left is limited, after going to Room 413, I must avoid trouble first.
There are four male dormitory buildings in the West campus, which accommodate several times more students than the East campus. Now is the busiest time for the male dormitory building, with the sound of people taking a shower, plastic basin falling, and conversations, which can be heard clearly standing downstairs.
This building is similar to the East Campus.
Chen Ge acted very naturally, following behind four students as they entered the first building.
The door of the shed that the caretaker lives in was tightly closed, but the windows were open and there was an older woman in her fifties singing inside; she looked quite happy.
A notice was posted next to the window, stating that it is strictly forbidden for students to use high-power electrical appliances in the dormitory, and it is also forbidden for students to cook in the dormitory.
I remember something written on the East Campus dormitory bulletin board, it seemed to be, "Recently there have been malicious incidents, students are forbidden from going out after lights out."
Separated by a wall, almost as two worlds apart, it's like the difference between "inside" and "outside" of the gate.
Chen Ge and several members of the club arrived at the entrance of Dormitory 413 after walking through the corridor.
"This dormitory is not much different from other dormitories."
Wang Yicheng opened the door, after he entered the room, everyone in his dormitory ignored him as if he didn't exist, doing their own things without speaking a word to him.
After taking a few steps inside, King Yi Cheng saw that the male student sleeping by the side of the door suddenly lifted up the mosquito net and gave him a glance: "How many times have I said it?"
"Come in, shut the door behind you. Is your leg lame? Are your ears not working either?"
The boy talked in a very unpleasant way, and he didn't know why it seemed like he hated Wang Yicheng.
He didn't close the door because there were still people coming in. If you need an apology, we can offer you one on his behalf, but we don't know what kind of apology you need?
Chen Ge grabbed the doorknob and entered the room, he glanced at the other people in the dorm.
When the mosquito net man saw Chen Ge, he shrank back in terror and remained silent, with his face darkening as he pulled the netting up again.
"Mr. Bai, this is Bed 4; since nobody is staying here, we can use it for our luggage."
Wang Yicheng pointed to bed four, on which were several luggage bags. Only his belongings were put under his own bed; everybody else had thrown their belongings and luggage onto bed four.
Chen Ge is familiar with bed No. 4, he himself has lain on it in the East Campus.
Walk to bed number four, although no one is living in the bed now, it is still with quilt and sheet, however, the bedding is now dirty with luggage and belongings.
