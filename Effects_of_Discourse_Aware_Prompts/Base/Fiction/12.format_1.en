Vermilion Bird.
Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan gazed at Bai Xiao Chen and Little Dragon who were playing and having fun. Suddenly, she heard a loud noise coming from outside, and her eyebrows slightly furrowed. "What happened outside? Why is there such a commotion?"
Go out and have a look.
The Vermilion Bird clasped her fists in salute, bowed in obeisance, and after a moment's hesitation, she pushed open the bamboo hut door and walked in, saying hesitantly, "Your Majesty, there are two people outside who have come to see you..."
"Look for me?"
Bai Yan's eyebrows raised, "Then I'll go out and see who it is that's come to find me."
She stood up slowly from the chair and walked towards the door.
Outside, beneath the bloody sky, two people tremblingly crawled over from the front, perhaps having gone through too much which caused them to leave behind a bloody trace passing through the white faces, conspicuously striking.
What are you guys doing?
White brows lightly furrowed, she asked coldly.
The two elders were pale-faced, trembling as they crawled on the ground, stammering, “Your Majesty, I come here to kowtow before you and apologize. It was I who was gullible and trusting of that imposter, which caused you to misunderstand the king. All of this is my fault, I am willing to accept any punishment; please forgive me.”
No, Your Majesty, it is my fault for not bringing you the king's orders. In fact, on that day the king left the palace to release the seal of the demon world. He asked me to come back to inform the queen, but I was not able to do it, which gave the treacherous people an opportunity to take advantage of.
Huobu knelt on the ground with tears streaming down his face: "All mistakes are my fault. If the queen wants to hit or scold me, I will not dissent." He took the bamboo stick behind him, supported it with both hands, and presented it in front of Baiyan with his head bowed deeply, his face showing his death as if he was resigned to it.
White hands slowly grasped the bamboo stick dragged up by Fire Feather, her expression was indifferent and there was a mysterious glow in her eyes that could not be read.
It seemed to perceive that the bamboo tube was away from its hand, so the Fire Feather's body stiffened, it gritted its teeth tightly and waited for the bout, as if it was smashing bamboo.
But...
It's been a long time, but no pain has come.
Firebud was shocked to look up and saw a fiery flame from the bamboo held in Baiyan's hand, burning to ashes in an instant.
You have suffered much on this journey?
"King...Queen?"
Houba looked at Baiyan in confusion, seemingly not understanding the meaning of her words.
"Since that is so, your debt is paid in full, rise up now."
Bai Yan has always been a clear-cut person in the company. She only targets those who attempt to harm her.
That day she was easily fooled, let alone by Grand Elder and Huo Yu. Therefore, she never complained about them..
Huabu's body was as stiff as iron, not daring to believe that Baiyan had let them off so easily?
Before their arrival, they had already made preparations for the worst.
Nowadays, she absolved them of their crime without even giving them a slap.
Seeing the two people kneel motionlessly on the ground with a pale expression: "What's wrong?"
Are you still waiting for me to help you up?
The woman's harsh voice fell into Fire Feather's ears, startling him to immediately climb up from the ground. His trouser legs were all covered in fresh blood, and he could not stand firmly.
Even so, he still stood on the ground, his legs trembling, but he did not kneel down again.
Bai Yan looked at the two people, both of whom had difficulty supporting themselves, and pointed to the stone platform on the ground: "Sit down, and rest for a while, then you can go down the mountain."
