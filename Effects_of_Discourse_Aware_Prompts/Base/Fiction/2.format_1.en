Under the suppression of the machine guns, the base was in chaos, and nobody noticed the special forces sneaking into the camp.
It didn't take much effort; Kurtov placed the beacon at the predetermined target, then led his team from the base and safely reached the evacuation point, where he called in the airstrike.
In no time, four missiles dropped by the Russian Stealth Bomber whizzing above the clouds had precisely hit two arms depots and two fuel tanks in the base.
The shockwave of the explosion swept through the whole camp, directly blowing down the concrete buildings in a circle around it.
The explosive shells and burning fireballs flew across the camp, triggering a series of chain reactions, with flames everywhere and blood and corpses scattered around.
The guards stationed in the camp sustained nearly half of the casualties, and the remaining people were mostly injured, it was almost impossible to find a single intact person.
Medical personnel carried the stretcher through the base, searching for the wounded who had lost their mobility.
The armed engineer, clad in thick bomb-proof clothing, rushed bravely into the inferno to drag unexploded shells out of the ruins.
The soldiers who were still able to move all got up and searched for their own squad to assemble with.
Salds watched the flickering fires outside the window, and a layer of despair gradually crept into his dazed eyes.
Thick smoke blanketed the entire base, the firelight dyed the night sky crimson, it was almost like the end of the world.
Thank you.
He muttered to himself, and slowly moved his lead-seeming legs away from the window.
He turned around and locked eyes with the commander's chief of staff.
"Commander, what should we do?"
The reverberation of the explosion finally died down, and no more ammunition exploded in the base. However, no one could stay calm. The mercs who escaped the explosion all knew this was only the beginning of their nightmares.
The previous explosion seemed to ignite some kind of signal, sounding the horns of the Sami military's attack.
Under Jiang Chen's will, Sāmí seized this fleeting opportunity, stood in front of everyone and waved his arms high, leading the remaining rebels to the front lines.
More than six thousand people ran across the meadow, heading towards the pine forest illuminated by the fire.
Looking far away, it was a spectacular scene.
At the same time, all the mercenaries fighting on the frontline were thrown into panic and their morale plummeted, watching the thick smoke rising up behind the base.
When facing the incoming onslaught of rioters, even though they had the power to hold back the line, they had no heart to continue fighting.
Without any suspense, the Arrow Company's defense was broken through, and the stubborn mercenaries were routed in the face of the Sami army's human wave tactic.
Some people escaped back into the burning base, but most people defected and ran deep into the forest.
No need for Jiang Chen to remind, even a pighead should know what to do now.
Watching Sami leading the mob to attack the military base, Jiang Chen put away his binoculars, summoned the trail-prepared ATV from the storage space, and patted Ayisha's back lightly.
Almost there, let's go.
Hmm!
Aysha nodded and as soon as Jiang Chen got on the motorbike, she agilely hopped on behind him.
The engine roared, and the tires churned up a layer of slush.
Jiang Chen rode his off-road motorbike down the hillside, circled to the side of the base with Aisha, stopped the motorbike by the side of the road, shook out the laser sword from the storage space, and casually swung it twice in his hand, effortlessly cutting through the wire mesh protective wall.
The entire base was engulfed in fire and chaos, and the sound of artillery could be heard from time to time. All of the mercenaries who were able to carry guns had gone to the frontline and were fighting the mob for control of the main gate.
Except for a guard regiment stationed in front of the command center, no one else can be seen in the entire rear area.
For Jiang Chen and Aisha, this is no different from not being on guard.
There were a total of ten police officers, two of whom were stationed at the guard tower and the remaining eight at the entrances of the first and second floors.
Aisha took out the ghost sniper rifle and silently resolved the two guards standing in the watchtower, then using the blind spot in her vision, she shot and killed the eight people on the floors above and below.
After Ayisha had taken care of the guards outside the command post, Jiang Chen picked up his rifle and walked towards the main door. Just as he passed by the HMMWV at the door, he ran into Saldes, who had rushed out from the command post in a hurry, as well as the officers from the command post.
The two of them were obviously caught off guard when they locked eyes.
The consultant responded the quickest, reaching into his pocket to draw his gun, however, before his hand even reached his chest, Ahishat was faster and shot him in the head.
Sardis was about to resist, but he was easily held back by Jiangchen, both his hands were pinned against the side of the Hummer.
"Saldes, male, 43 years old."
Is it correct that I am appointed as the General Manager of Arrow Company and also serve as Supreme Commander?
Although it was the first time meeting each other, the holographic helmet worn on Jiang Chen's head was connected to the Phantom Agents database and stored his photo and personal information.
It was just a face-to-face encounter, and his information was projected onto the holographic screen.
With his face pressed against the car hood, the Saldes showed true grit in his unwillingness to surrender, gritting his teeth and saying with great determination.
I can't say anything, just kill me...
"Kill you?"
I haven't asked any questions yet.
Jiang Chen smiled without paying any attention to his uncooperative attitude and then, without any politeness, he took out a syringe with his right hand and jabbed it into his back.
No!
Salzs made a throaty growl of defiance and glared with his bloodshot eyes, but soon the spark in his pupils went dull.
Jiang Chen simply let go of the hand holding him, ordinary people can even resist truth serum, so this kind of precedent does not exist at all.
He turned Sarades over and asked Jiang Chen question after question word by word.
Where is Carmen?
"Inside the research institute of the underground bunker..."
Where is the underground shelter?
The entrance is located in the center of the base and can only be accessed by an elevator.
There are two parking lots next to the entrance, you can see them if you walk over.
One question and one answer, and Jiang Chen quickly got the information he wanted.
"Very well, now you can have what you wished for."
Jiang Chen pulled out his gun and shot in the back of his head, then threw his corpse aside.
This is certainly a painless way to die, but for Mr. Saldes, the renowned CEO of the Arrow Corporation, to die in such an anonymous way might be more painful than death itself… if dead people do feel pain.
"Underground shelter?"
Glancing towards the center of the base, Jiang Chen smirked coldly.
No matter what Carmen is still plotting, his luck has run out.
The fate of the House of Lancaster will be as it began, with a war to fame and another to pass away in silence.
At this time, a sorrowful shrill cry came from far away.
