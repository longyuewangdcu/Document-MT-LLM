What are you guys doing?!
The old man in the East Palace knocked his cane with a sound filled with anger.
Our ancestor is about to arrive, please Old Lord of the Eastern Palace stay calm, what you need to do, you will know in a bit. The leader of the group replied.
The Lord of the East Palace naturally knew who the 'ancestor' in his mouth referred to.
He was a little lost and did not know why Bai Yi was here.
It is really not a good thing to have holidays with DK; although everyone in R Country wants to chase DK away, it is totally impossible.
Just a daydream.
After a few minutes, Pei Yi's car arrived.
He got off the car and his gaze shifted to the car not far away.
An Xiaoning saw him, but did not take off his mask and wig, and also got off the car.
Wu Lianzi closely followed after it.
You are here. said An Xiao Ning.
Pei Yishang looked her up and down then smiled rarely, came close to her and said in a lower voice, "Ayo, it's hard to guess it's you with such an outfit in the crowd, right?"
Of course, I don't want them to know my identity so I asked you to come, but now it's not the right time.
Pei Yixia subconsciously glanced at Wu Lianzhi and asked, "What are you doing with him?"
Something is up.
He straightened his body, turned around, and with a faint smile on his face said to people from the Donggong family, "I don't know what my sister did to offend you people from the Donggong family, to think that you wanted to kill her?"
Have you mustered up the courage to reach the top?
As soon as the Donggong family heard this, their faces changed instantaneously--Peyi's little sister?
Where does Pei Yi's sister come from?
The old lady from the Eastern Palace spoke out, "We really don't know anything about Mr. Pei's little sister..."
I don't know what to say, but now I'm telling you.
Péi Yìlěng said coldly, "Did you hear clearly?"
Since Mr. Pei has said this is your cousin, then please take your cousin away. As for Dong Gong Lianzhi, his name is still in our family genealogy and he has not been disinherited yet, he is still an our Dong Gong family's person. How we deal with him is our Dong Gong family's business.
Pei Yi hadn't responded yet, so An Xiaoning had to take action; she shouted at him, "Brother, he is my boyfriend, he is the flesh and blood of my womb now, you cannot let him go."
Pai Yi originally wanted to leave with only her, but now it's become somewhat complicated.
However, being domineering is also his style, so no matter what he wants to do, it's no big deal.
Grandma, you heard it too, this one- he is my brother-in-law already, they already have a child. To hand the person over to you all, wouldn't it mean that the kid will have no father in the future?
Do you think I will agree?
The East Palace elder was very clear that if they let Pei Yi take the child away, then subsequently even in a legitimate manner they would not be able to deal with their own grandchild, so despite being wary of DK’s influence, they couldn’t slacken their attitude.
Mr. Pei, this probably cannot be done. We have our own family rules; outsiders are not allowed to interfere in the disposition of our own family members.
It is said that he is the father of my sister's child, could it be that you are getting old and your ears are not functioning properly?
Pei Yijiang shifted his gaze onto Wu Lianzhi and asked, "You tell me, are you from the Donggong family?"
This morning, when my mother sent me a poisonous dish, I already broke off mother-daughter relationship on the spot. Previously, when the people of the Donggong Family tried to frame Miss An, me and his subordinate to death, I was already very clear. Now, although the name Donggong Lianzhi still exists on the family tree and the family register of the Donggong Family, I am no longer a Donggong. My name is now Wu Lianzhi, I am no longer a member of the Donggong Family!
Every word is filled with enthusiasm and every sentence is filled with coldness.
He boldly declared his intention in front of so many people, proving his determination.
The Dowager said, "That's not what you said! In my Dowager's house, one is born a family member and one dies a family ghost!"
The Dowager Lady at the East Palace, I want to ask you, have you been made aware that your plans to assassinate Miss An have been revealed to her? Are you not worried about the repercussion of the foreign country if they threaten a serious protest at the thought of punishing me?
This sentence came from Wu Lianzhi’s mouth, with an indifferent tone and no fear.
I and An Xiaoning have done business with each other. Pei Yiwi smiled slightly, "She is the type who pays her debts of hostility; do you really think she will forgive and forget so easily?"
"Well, that's it. I don't want to waste too much of my valuable time, so I'm taking both of them with me."
Someone from the East Palace family was speaking again, and he added, "If you don't want to see bloodshed here."
So, the people of Donggong Family watched as the originally cooked duck flew away completely.
The old duke and duchess of the East Palace were really angry.
In the end, the old lady of the Eastern Palace spoke directly, "Forget it, remove his name, and cancel his household registration!"
We have to go back to Country S.
Pei Yixia cast a glance at her, “Use it up and leave?”
"Didn't you say you will agree to my request, and now before I even tell you what it is, you are saying to go back to the country?"
I'm in a hurry to go back home and I have something to do, but I will keep my promise if you have a request. So what is it?
"Well, my request may be a bit challenging for you..."
"Let's not mention that then; let's say something that won't make me feel uncomfortable."
Pei Yice passed by her side, without shifting his gaze, saying, "You are still the same, spend half a month with me."
What kind of accompaniment do you mean?
The same as before.
An Xiaoning looked at him, "No, first of all, no chains, I can't be restricted in my freedom. Half a month is too long. Two days is fine."
Pai Yi's smile faded slightly, "You are asking for too much of a discount. Five days, no less. You said to let others make the request, they have made it and you can't go back on your word; they'll definitely give you freedom."
Can I go back to my country first?
No.
Wu Lian in the car listened to the conversation between the two people, and really wondered if the two people had something going on?
Are these two people in an ambiguous relationship?
It sounds like no matter how I listen to it.
But if that is the case, it would be too indiscreet of the two people to do so in his presence.
"Why don't he go back to S country first, and I stay in your place by myself, is that okay?"
I won't ask you guys how it goes. Let's do it together. His words are unquestionable.
An Xiaoning no longer has anything to say.
Because it wasn't far from Qingping Mountain, we arrived there soon.
Coming back to this place really stirs up all kinds of emotions.
Qin Guo saw her in that moment and was really not pleased, and once they went in, she immediately rolled her eyes.
How did her ancestors bring back this plague god again?
