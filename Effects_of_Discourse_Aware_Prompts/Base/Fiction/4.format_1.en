He gave her a disdainful look and said, "Oh come on, you're being narcissistic."
"Am I not good-looking?"
Frowning and pouting, he pretended to be angry.
She stammered a bit and then laughed, clutching one of her hands to her chest, squeezing it hard.
He glared at her, grinding his teeth, "...shrewd foolish woman."
He quickened his pace and walked to the bedside, not sparing a single glance of tenderness, and threw Xuxu onto the bed directly, then he started to unbutton his shirt, one button at a time.
Untie the belt, shed all of the shackles from the body, then burrow into the bed, press against the fluffy body.
Rough and simple, not at all romantic.
Deep black eyes meet her gaze, and her beating heart accelerates uncontrollably.
Yes, after being together for so many years, every time when they looked at each other, her heart still felt like a startled deer, feeling shy and embarrassed.
Perhaps due to being too familiar, I always feel awkward.
"So they say it's not wise to meddle in the affairs of an acquaintance, and a rabbit won't eat the grass around its burrow, and it's true."
Looking shy and blushing, he spontaneously got excited yet felt upset; the excitement was an automatic response from his hormones, whereas the upset was from deep within his heart.
Although he liked to see her shy appearance, he didn't like that she kept so reserved and didn't take initiative due to her shyness.
What else do you want to hear? I have already told you, just look at me.
He demanded her to look at him directly in the face, with a vigorous gaze, as if holding a vivid portrait in his hands.
Her face became even brighter red and she pursed her lips with her eyes shifting restlessly, "So, tell me, did you also steal someone else's love letter that was meant for me?"
Uh...
In addition to Zhao Zheng's love letter, Jiang Zhuoheng's chocolate and movie tickets, there is also the colorful BangBangTang owned by the son of Haobang, the public security bureau Chief Haowang, who is one grade above us.
Hearing this, Xuxu was taken aback and said, "What? Hao Bang?"
That science prodigy who is renowned as "Praised by All"?
That is why he is called "praised by thousands of people", because of his name, not because thousands of people actually praised him. As long as you shout his name, it's praising him.
When she heard the name, she knew there was someone in the school with that name, and felt that was very negative.
Isn't that guy supposed to be a bookworm? How come he's giving her something?
Yes, the name is really cheap. The person who named it is even cheaper.
He said contemptuously, "Fortunately, I ate that lollipop for you. It was all chemical colors, and it dyed my tongue and lips in all colors. It's just cheap and low-quality food."
It sounded like: "..."
According to what he said, she should thank him for having someone else's food offered to her?
Xu Xu felt both exasperated and amused, and so couldn't help but reach out to give Yanrushan a poke on the head, saying, "Yanrushan, why don't you just go up to Heaven?"
He really profited from getting a bargain and was still pretending to be nice. This was something he especially liked to do.
After saying that, she looked at him again and asked with a smile, "So your dislike for Director Hao was because of Officer Hao?"
Although it was a question, the tone was firm.
"With not a word spoken, it amounts to an implicit consent."
She hesitantly glanced at him, then quickly averted her gaze away with an "uh", as she got lost in his deep dark eyes.
Then she asked, "How did you do all this? Why didn't I know about it?"
She pouted, as if she didn't have anything to say.
