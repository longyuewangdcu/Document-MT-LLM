Little Mo has a moment, his mind is stirred, and he feels sorrowful.
"Supervisor, this is... don't dare to move, right?"
Once his body moved, his mind must have started to move too; how could he be so smart and not know that Bai Weiwei had already died?
He unwilling to accept, and also not daring to ponder deeply, he can only force himself to stay like that, convincing himself that Bai Weiwei is just sleeping and will soon wake up.
Little Mo felt that only when Bai Weiwei's corpse started to rot, would the Lord Supervisor regain consciousness and realise that the person whom he was holding hands with had passed away long ago.
Strangely enough, there was no change to Bai Weiwei's corpse.
Even her pale face had improved somewhat; although her body was cold, it was clear that she was asleep.
No trace of any of the victims' characteristics has appeared.
Muyuan Jun guarded her, and his eyes shone brighter and brighter.
At last the famous herbalist had been captured and brought in. He was eating a tonic pill and said with a sigh, “It looks like my old life is about over.”
Muyun Jun has not slept for five days, and everyone can tell that his body is very exhausted.
However, he was exceptionally lucid, terribly lucid and abnormally so.
After she took the medicine, she fell asleep like this. I think I should ask you to come and take a look. When will she wake up?
The old man sighed and then went to the bedside to take White Weivei's pulse.
In fact, this phenomenon is extremely rare, so treatment is not necessary, but there is still one very important thing that needs to be done...
Muyan Jun listened attentively, just like a good student with fiery enthusiasm in his eyes.
The old man's voice dropped even lower as he said, "I have to heal someone else again..."
Mu Yanjun leaned forward, unwilling to miss his words.
The result was that the old man had the dexterity of lightning and in an instant he jabbed his neck.
Muyu's eyes suddenly widened and her hand already slapped toward the old man's forehead.
Xiao Mo thrust out her hand and caught Mu Yanjun's attack.
The back and forth was too much for Muyun to bear and he eventually drifted off to sleep.
The old man touched his head and said, "I almost died, but I don't think I have long to live. I'll be happy if he wakes up without going crazy."
White V-V cannot be saved.
Mu Yanjun's state was so heartbreaking that all five internal organs and six bowels had problems.
He doesn't eat, sleep, think or move--he's no different from a living corpse, if he continues like this for another two days, he'll disappear just like Bai Weiwei.
Xiao Mo looked at the wretched old man and said, "You are to protect the master of my household with your life. If you fail to do so this time, I will personally kill you."
After she finished, she immediately turned around and walked towards the place they were leading her to be punished, silently accepting her punishment.
The old man sighed, "No wonder my master said that even selling sweet potatoes cannot make one a divine doctor. Everyone treats me like a deity, but even the gods cannot make someone live if they want to die."
Muyan Jun only slept for two hours and his eyes were wide open.
He was startled, his eyes rarely showed panic, but he found that he was unable to move.
When the old man saw that he had awoken, he said, "Let me give you some acupuncture, your spirits have weakened, but with some nourishment, you should be able to see the King of Hell.”
Mur Yanjun's eyes dropped darkly, his complexion pale and wan yet still filled with an overwhelming aura that chilled people to the bone.
The old man gave him another jab; "I didn't want to save you in the first place. After all, your heart and soul is so evil and malicious. Who knows what kind of chaos will befall us if you are rescued."
Muyuan Jun's voice was soft yet eerie, "Let me go."
The old man shook his head, "This won't do, I can't revive your sharp-tongued person, saving you is considered compensation."
Muyuanjun suddenly laughed bitterly, "How can you repay, even if you saved all the people in this world - you couldn't even repay her the loss of a single hair." Despite the near escape, Wangye did not bear any sadness.
