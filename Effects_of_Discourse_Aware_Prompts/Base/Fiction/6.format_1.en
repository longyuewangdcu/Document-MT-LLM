The situation had gone awry, both sides fired with all their might, and the entire sky above the ocean was filled with smoke.
White Night's high-speed magnetic wave scan rifle fired again, and another plane was shot down by him. This gun was really useful and he was addicted to using it. Little Milky Way had a composed attitude, and the air force of the First Terrorist Organization formed an indestructible attack and defense team, beginning the last round of assault.
Nickla saw that the situation was not good and, without regard for formalities, he shouted loudly, "My lord, let's retreat. If we keep fighting like this, we will be wiped out."
Lewis clenched his fists tightly, his face dark and a fierce aura emanating from his body; he certainly could see the current situation.
But he was unwilling; to be beaten back like this when he could almost grasp them back. It was truly detestable to have his efforts go to waste.
The man with jade-green eyes swept past with a killing mission, and then he hid it in those silent and melancholy eyes. He nodded at Nick and immediately gave the order to shelter and retreat.
Louis narrowed his eyes and watched the two people drifting over the sea. He coldly snorted - this time, they were lucky; he wouldn't settle for that.
"My dear, they are retreating, shall we pursue them?" Bai Ye lightly smiled, he was attached to the magnetic scan gun, holding it like a child and his lips raised a casual yet dangerous smile.
Little Milk Bun smiled elegantly, giving the command to stop attacking. In the pitch-black big eyes was a peacefulness, and she slowly said: "Do not pursue him, let him die like this. It would be a pity if we do that. The game of cat catching the mouse had just begun."
This game has reversed the situation.
Louis, he ought not to have provoked him in the first place, even if it meant the death of Nono. He must find someone to accompany him to his burial, or else he'll never be able to live with this guilt.
When will the game start? According to Louis, it's set, but...
The little bun had a cold smile, which was intimidating. When it was all over, whatever he said would be final.
The moonlight smiled, sleeves sweeping gracefully, "Go, don't chase them. We have enough capital to play with him. Maybe they won't get around to doing anything and someone will be in a hurry to clean up the mess for Louis."
Little Bun watched their escape route with a cold, silent smirk.
"Chu Li, it's over, there's no need for support, let's head back immediately."
White Night and Chu Li had a good telephone conversation, so he commanded his subordinates to turn back to Rome.
It took Hei Ying and the others the collective strength of nine oxen and two tigers to drag Ye San Shao and Cheng An Ya up, they all knew that Cheng An Ya had the virus on her, so they had taken protective measures beforehand, Ye San Shao also warned them of the virus on himself, and Hei Ying and the others were extra careful.
Ye Sanshao was lying flat, gasping for breath. He couldn't help but to kick Miss Cheng involuntarily, "Little Anya, you need to lose some weight. You are so heavy now."
His entire shoulder was a little numb because he had swam in the sea for a long time, consumed a lot of energy, and then drifted around with Cheng Anye--it was really tiring for the arms.
I almost dropped her into the sea, he still felt a chill recalling the scene.
The Black Eagles and the others cheered for their safety, handing over towels, pouring hot water and everyone was busy, and someone took the opportunity to joke and ask how Yesanhao was spending his days.
It was very lively on the plane, and with the men together, courage could not be absent.
Cheng Anyan took the towel that Black Eagle passed and wiped her hair, and then she wrapped her cold body with a blanket. Her ears automatically filtered out his words. Finally, she felt safe. She sneezed and couldn't help herself but to pull her body closer.
The Black Eagle laughed, saying: "Third Young Master, if your wife loses any more weight, she'll just be skin and bones."
I'm already despising it now.
Ye Sanshao also got up, wiping the seawater off his body, “It's because of the spare ribs that it's so heavy.”
Chen Anya continued to uphold the virtue of silence; the Blackhawks found two sets of clothes for them to change into, but since these were men's clothes, it was rather comical to see them on Chen Xiao jie. So, she simply wrapped herself in a blanket.
Just as Ning Ning changed her clothes, the Black Eagle told her that she wanted to have a chat with her.
Chen Anyang grabbed the microphone excitedly and said, "Baby, it's Mommy!"
Hi Mom, have you missed me?
Little Dumpling sat on the sofa, chatting with Cheng Anyang with a beaming smile. She hadn't heard her mom's voice in so long, it made her strangely miss her.
I don't want any at all.
Cheng Anya snorted coldly and spoke with a menacing tone, "You are so incompetent, it took you so long to find Mommy, you should get a spanking."
Ning Ning thought of Xu Nuo, her heart sank and then she smiled, "Alright, my baby will answer the call. Wait till I am back in Rome, you can hit me however you want to. I really miss my mommy, but you don't really care for me enough. I scorn you."
Condemnation.
Cheng Anya laughed and worriedly asked, "Are you hurt at all?"
No, I'm fine, nothing has happened, don't worry. Ningning said with a smile, "Mom, the plane is about to land, we'll talk in a bit."
Good.
Little milkbag closed the communicator and Cheng Anyan drank hot water to warm up her body, Ye Sanshawo had been eagerly looking forward to talking a few words with his son, but he ended up hanging up without being able to chat, he was extremely displeased and glared accusingly at Cheng Anyan with his two eyes.
Miss Cheng calmly ignored him and the Black Eagle smiled, “Third Young Master, the plane is about to land, we'll be able to meet Young Master soon.”
Ye Sanshao felt utterly ignored and he couldn't help but grab Miss Cheng and snarled, "You conscienceless thing."
Miser.
Chen Anya scolded while pouring him hot water, and Ye Sanshao drank the remain water in addition to what was in Chen Xiaojie's cup. It would be even more delightful if there was some wine to warm his body.
The plane landed very soon, and all landed in the castle. Chu Li, Ye Wei, Eleven and others were all there, and when they saw that Ye San Shao and Cheng Anyan were safe, everyone let out a sigh of relief.
"Big brother, big sister-in-law, you guys sure are in a tough spot…"
Ye Wei laughed with a quiver in her chin, and said, "Third brother, I should take a picture of this as a keepsake."
You stinky girl.
Ye San Shao yelled in anger, but seeing that Wei Wei 11 and Little Milk Bun were okay, he was finally relieved.
After so much effort, how could anything else go wrong?
Little Milk Bun wanted to joyfully hug Cheng Anya, but she strictly commanded him to stop. Then Little Milk Bun remembered that his mother had the virus and the Black Eagle had already mentioned it; afterwards he looked at his mother and father's clasped hands, and his heart sank slightly.
Father, Mother, you both...it's late at night, please help them look after it.
Xiao Nai Bao's first response was to look for Bai Ye, a genius doctor who could not be beaten by any illness.
"Got it, got it, don't worry."
"The night laughed in white."
Virus?
A blonde-haired, blue-eyed hunk winked, "Little White, this isn't your strong suit, is it?"
Little White?
Baiye twisted her wrist, smiling gently with ease, "Jason, try calling out 'Little White' again?"
"Damn it, what's wrong with me being called Little White? I was Little White to begin with, why are you calling me Black Jack Little Iron?"
Jason, known as the Fire-breathing Dragon, instantly sent out torrents of fire, just like a golden lion king, yet he was handsome enough to arouse everyone's admiration.
Especially that pair of sky blue eyes, as dazzling as a sapphire.
He was filled with rage and intimidating aura, like a volcano eruption, his domineering aura was very apparent.
The Black Jack standing next to him is a young man in his twenties, born with exquisite features. He is a blend of Chinese and English blood, with an Eastern mysteriousness in his facial features and a Western depth. He has a pair of grey-blue eyes, always in a foggy and blurry state, giving people a feeling of deep emotion. But upon closer inspection, you will find that he is extremely perceptive, full of an introverted serenity that is never revealed.
The two top leaders of the first terrorist organization were young, with two distinct personalities. One had an imperial aura and the other two great leaders were here too.
Looking down this row, it's quite a visual impact.
"Jason, you really need to be fixed."
Eleven hummed and said, "What's wrong with calling him Little White? Little White, beat him up!"
Ye Wei glanced at them and shook her head, "Brother Three, Sister-in-Law, don't pay attention to them. You should have a hot bath first and look into it later, so as to avoid getting sick."
She called for the maidservants to take Ye Chen and Cheng Anyan to go wash up, though the Little Milk Bag wanted to follow, he still stayed here, White Night had a hostile expression and was about to fight. Little Milk Bag hastily pulled at his sleeve.
"White Night, can you find a way to save my dad and mom?"
The child's eyes were bright, like two black grapes embedded in a white and tender face, filled with anticipation, as if shaking his head in the night, the light in his eyes would dim.
Jason picked up the little baby bundle and held it in his embrace, with a heroic air. "My baby, don't worry. I can even revive the dead. Don't worry about the living. Come over here and help me take out the mob protection when you have time."
"Who just questioned White Night's medical skills?"
Blackjack expressed confusion at this, and Jason swung his hand past; he deftly dodged it.
The little milk bun was held by the tall man, extremely uneasy, and kicked Jason, "Put me down."
I want an obedient son like you, Ning Ning. Will you be my son? I have been longing for you for so long. Jason's azure eyes were sparkling and shone brightly like a piece of juicy meat.
Everyone, "..."
The White Night smiled and said, "Jason, let your mom teach you Chinese again. Don't keep saying that the commanding officer can't use words, you won't get far either."
"Isn't my rank lower than the commander's?"
Jason was very unhappy about being linked to his superior. Said that an official couldn't possibly be an accomplice; it's an issue of principle.
Little bun struggled a bit, and when Jason let him go, Little bun asked, "White Night..."
Ning Ning, I'll be able to confirm after I examine them, so don't worry. White Night said, patting the little one's head, "I promise I'll do my best."
Little White Bao just lost the promise, and in the situation where his parents' life and death cannot be guaranteed, no matter how calm he is, he still feels anxious. He can't lose them again, and the White Night understands his current state of mind.
"Don't worry too much," said Baiye.
Ye Wei said, "Done, leave it to Bailu. There are no issues in this world that cannot be solved. Since Louis was able to come up with the virus, there must be a cure. It can't be impossible. If Bailu can't figure it out, take off his sign."
Chu Li smiled and said, "Agreed."
"Little White, do you have a signature move?"
Jason expressed deep confusion; he never knew what his trademark was.
He wanted desperately to punch him with a single punch.
"Speaking of that, why didn't you two catch Louis coming back?"
Blackjack asked, ``This guy's dead already, so we can rest easy."
I have wanted to get rid of him for a long time. The mob has been picking fights all over lately and yet he still finds the time to play love games. He is indeed dull-witted.
Louis isn't in a hurry. Little Milk Bun slowly said, a hint of danger appearing on her face, her pitch-black eyes only filled with calculated glint - "Victory that comes without fighting is the highest level of success. It's one thing that he and us have a private feud, but it's another story when it comes to the fight between the mafias and terrorist organizations.
We will certainly have to spend huge amounts of money and resources if we want to exterminate the mafia.
After this incident, Louis' position in the mafia was jeopardized. I've always suspected that there is still some power lurking somewhere hidden from our sight. Otherwise, the mafia wouldn't have let Louis act in such a self-destructive way. So, let's have Louis lead us to uncover this power and annihilate it in one go.
Deceitfulness...
This is a unanimous idea.
Although knowing he has always been crafty and sneaky, because of his young age he still gets a lot of coddling, plus he has a tender and delicate appearance, people tend to overlook his original nature.
Sarcastic or mean!
Jason raised his thumbs up. He was always a man of action, not giving others the chance to overthink things. Most of the time, however, he would still listen to Black Jack and Chuli's plans.
The plan of the small dumpling, he always acquiesces unquestioningly.
Following a true actionist is a powerful team of advisors, which is a terrifying force.
Chu Li said he and Bai Ye agreed with his opinion, "It's a once-and-for-all solution so that nobody dares to provoke us anymore."
Ning Ning's words, when have you ever refuted them, you shamelessly went along with it.
Black Jack said with a smile, "This time, we should definitely give the mafia a lesson and let them know they can't mess with us in the next fifty years."
White Night nodded, he had no opinion either, his top priority was to be able to cure the viruses on Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anye, that was the important one, the rest was to be left to Chu Li.
Ye Wei and Eleven glanced at each other, was there another force?
They all have the same thought, is it Mo Ye and Mo Yue?
Within the Mafia, only they have the power of enough appeal and their mysteriousness. Aside from them, they couldn't think of anyone who would be able to have such courage - it should be a man who surpasses even Louis, yet he's taking orders from him.
Everyone moved to the living room, and Little Pudding went to look for Cheng Anya. She had just taken a bath, drank a cup of hot tea, her body warm and fragrant, her cheeks blushing pink, lying on the bed, lost in thought as she looked at her own fingernails.
"Mommy...."
The little bun pushed the door and walked in, giggling merrily as it came closer.
Chen Anyan snapped back to attention, narrowed her eyes and praised, "Baby, you have style."
This outfit, truly amazing with an imposing manner, a hint of childishness, making it seem as if this person is a dangerous character.
Thank you, Mom, for the compliment.
"Stay away, sit farther away, I'm afraid I can't help but punch you."
Chen Anya pointed to the sofa across from her and said, "Sit there."
Little Xiao Milk Bun gave Chen Anya a resentful look and said, "Mom, you're starting to dislike me."
Correct.
"Cheng Anyay smiled as she glanced at Little Milk Bun. She always felt something different about this kid, though it didn't seem to be different from his past. But the mother is the one who knows her child the best. Whatever changes have taken place, no matter how hidden they are, she could feel it somewhat."
"Mom, why are you looking at me like that? Do you think I'm handsome?"
The little bun innocently bat his eyes, looking very cute.
Cheng Anya looked at him with a smile, but not a real one, "You've learned the art of self-admiration quite well from your dad. Is there anything wrong lately? Tell Mom the truth, were you bullied?"
The little dumpling shook his head, "No."
Louis showed me a photo, it was clearly covered in blood from being beaten.
Cheng Anya obviously didn't believe it, grinding her teeth and saying, "Even if he were to be cut to pieces, I wouldn't hate him."
Thinking of all that she had suffered, Cheung On-Nga hated Louis with an intense passion.
Her bewitching face was cloaked with a touch of melancholy; thinking of the trauma infant bun had suffered, she felt a wave of bad premonition.
"Mom, I'm really alright, it's most likely something he made up."
Little Bun smiled gracefully, rolled up her sleeve to reveal a plump white arm. "Look, not a single bruise."
The gunshot wound on his arm healed fairly well, so he wasn't afraid at all of being discovered by Cheng Anya.
The lashes he had sustained were all promises left behind by her. Since it was her promise to beat him, he didn't feel bullied, but rather a little yearning for the pain when she had punched him.
If Nono were alive, he would rather spend his whole life being beaten up by her.
"Ning Ning, are you really okay?"
Cheng Anya frowned, having not missed the hurt flickering in her son's eyes.
The little bun nodded and said, "I'm really okay, Mommy, but you and daddy have something wrong. Uncle Hawk said there was a virus on you. How did daddy get infected too?"
Cheng Anya remembered Ye Sanshao who was given a recharge by a spirit bug, her cheeks reddened again. She could no longer say what she wanted or desired. "Don't mention it, I had to board an airplane in the desert, and another in the sea. How could I not been in contact with someone?"
Miss Cheng spoke calmly, Little Milk Bun didn't suspect him.
Mom, don't worry. Baiye's medical skills are so excellent that there must be some way to save you.
