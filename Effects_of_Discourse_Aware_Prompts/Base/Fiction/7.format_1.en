At this moment, the Blue Silver Golden Light Array emerged and the firelight dimmed suddenly, being guided downward.
But that fire-jar obviously was not so easy to deal with; it fiercely drew breath upwards, something that actually swept away a portion of the fire, then came a "whoosh" as it shot off to the side, flying out of the range of the blue and silver light array.
These changes have happened so quickly it feels almost overwhelming.
This person is hard to deal with!
We must take it quickly, or else the law enforcers will come.
Flames spat out of the fireball and the girl reappeared, her eyes brimming with a menacing aura, "What are you doing?"
In the time she was speaking, a flash of golden light appeared beneath her feet, a beautiful ring of light appeared quietly, and the woman's body suddenly stiffened.
Tangwu Lin's Blue Yin Grass coiled up in response,leaf star tongue stars sword pointing forward at the opponent's chest,Xie Kai has arrived behind her silently, the light dragon dagger goes on her neck.
Everything is a ruse!
What could be better than Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Lockchain against a single opponent?
The absolute establishment of the Starlight Lockchain is an existence against heaven!
Just when everyone let out a sigh of relief, thinking they had vanquished their opponent, an unexpected turn of events happened! The Star God Sword had already appeared in front of him, while a Shining Dragon Dagger had also arrived behind his neck. With her life threatened, the woman's eyes suddenly lit up.
A loud phoenix chirp sounded from her, followed by a powerful and unmatched soul power bursting out of her body in an instant. As if stimulated by something, a circle of crimson light shone from underneath her clothes, and a halo appeared respectively around her neck, shoulders, elbows, waist and knees, as if it was inside the clothes. As these crimson lights appeared, the powerful soul power instantly burst out of the woman.
It was unknown how much it had grown in comparison to before, the soul force surging upwards and turning into a huge ring of fire. On the fire gourd in the sky a layer of fine-grained golden lines were revealed, the originally one chi (3.33 feet) high fire gourd shot straight up to two chi (6.66 feet) high and had increased by a few rings' worth.
The fierce fire element burst out in an instant, with the fierce impact it was able to send Tang Wu Lin and the other people flying out, and the flames burned their spiritual power like a maggot consuming their bones.
As the roc cries grew louder and louder, a woman exuded a powerful aura and then dark red armor pieces quickly appeared, covering her entire body.
There is a phoenix helmet atop the head, which covers the head and extends to both sides in a dark red armor. The beautiful curving lines extend downward, outlining the features of a woman. At the shoulders, there is a soft, curved line that wraps around the arm, covering it entirely.
Dark-red flame patterns covered the armor, and on the chest armor, there was a golden-red phoenix pattern. The armor wasn't particularly gorgeous, but when it was put on, the woman's aura had risen by several levels.
Tang Wulin blurted out at the same time, his face already full of bitter smiles.
Doukei, yes, this is doukei! Judging from its complexity and aura fluctuations, it should be a Doukei and the shimmering halo surrounding the female is a tool that stores the Doukei.
A single Word Armour is not enough to be integrated into the Word Armour Master's body.
Even so, this is a complete set of body armor!
It means that the girl who originally attained the realm of Five Rings was directly promoted to the realm of Seven Rings in terms of strength.
Yaan Feng was very angry at the moment, as she was in a particularly good mood and very happy earlier today. She had just gone to Heavenly Writ Spirit Transmitting Pagoda to officially register herself as an One Word Battle Armour Master.
The Dou Kai Shi is a top-tier existence that any organization is willing to foster, and just at the time of signing the contract, the Chuan Ling Tower side promised her a series of welfare policies. She is only twenty-seven this year and is one of the youngest Dou Kai Shis in Tian Ling City, with an immeasurable future ahead.
The Tower of Spirits has promised that in the future it will provide her with many resources to help her become a Double Sword Armor Master, and if that happens, she will be a real Double Sword Armor Master with a place of her own in the whole continent.
Little did she expected that as soon as she stepped out of the Tower of Spirits, she was surrounded by a group of young youngsters.
Moreover, their capabilities are quite strong, and if they do not use armor, they would've been at a great disadvantage.
She had no idea that Tang Wulin and them had no ill-intent. The Star Charm Sword and Light Dragon Dagger made her feel a threat of death.
At this moment, Wu Changkong's voice sounded in the ears of the six Tang Wuliners, "As long as you defeat her, this city will count as your pass."
Tang Wurin twitched the corner of her mouth, Teacher Wu ah Teacher Wu, you have a devious side too!
This is a full-state One-Word Douluo, equivalent to a Seven-Ring Soul Sage-level powerhouse, can we win?
Before he had time to think, Yanfeng had already made a move. Powerful soul power suddenly rose up and his right hand pointed toward Tang Wulin as a fire torch above his head suddenly spurted out a flame before coming to a stop in front of Tang Wulin.
That's how it is; there's nothing left to do but try our luck. Explanations are undoubtedly useless. Just looking at other people's eyes, you can tell that they were already enraged.
They don't have anything to do with it. Let's deal with it first and then talk.
Tang Wu Lin took a deep breath, and the three purple spirit rings on his body suddenly disappeared. A golden aura appeared and spread, his right arm ballooned, and golden dragon scales spread. At the same time, brilliant stars rapidly converged on his right hand, and a battle armor glove appeared.
To face a true Duelist, how can he not give it his all!
Are you talking about armor?
When Yan Feng saw the battle armor on Tang Wu Lin's right hand, she was also startled. The three words that emerged in her mind were "Impossible"!
How old is he?
And moreover, she could clearly see that Tang Wu-Lin's Battle Armor directly emerged from his body. Could it be that he is a Dual Battlefield Armorist?
Although it's just a suit of armor, owning a suit of armor at this age is unimaginable.
When she first got her first suit of armor at the age of 21, it was already termed as a genius.
I have been diligently practicing these years and finally became a true swordsman.
How old are these little guys here?
At the same time Tangwu Lin started, the others quickly took action.
Xu Lizhi had already stepped away far earlier, no more words were needed. Buns flew out of his hands one by one, light and dainty steamed buns, and bloodthirsty red bean buns, served one by one.
Tang Wulin left his left hand behind his body, already picking up the two buns and stuffing them into his mouth without hesitation.
Must settle quickly.
Even if it's just a single piece of Soul Armor, once the full set is assembled, it has the ability to quickly restore the Soul Mage's spirit power.
Engage in a protracted struggle with them, they have no chance at all.
With a loud “bang” as his left foot stomped firmly to the ground, Tang Wu Lin was propelled like a bronze arrow, the right arm blocking in front of his body as the blood surged within him and the Golden Dragon’s breath surged out. His eyes turned completely golden, and his body gave forth a fierce wave of energy and blood.
Right hand Golden Dragon Claw blocking in front of the body, pushing back the opponent's flames and pressing forward.
As a team captain and a frontline offensive spirit master, he must not retreat even the slightest bit, only if he stays at the front do his teammates have a chance.
Under the stimulation of the bloodthirsty red bean paste bun, his soul force, qi and blood power burst to the apex in an instant, the skin on his body producing pale golden scales. On his right hand, right arm, and right chest, these scales were especially dazzling.
He is a Twin Martial Spirit?
He was dumbfounded.
"Hmph!"
She did not dodge at all, the fireball on her head suddenly spun and the flame spread out, flew past Tang Wu Lin's head and covered her companions, protecting everyone else.
She wants to isolate Tangwulin, and first deal with this obvious little fellow who is the other party's head before speaking.
The golden dragon claw flashed lightning-fast to the opposite face, and Yanfeng's right hand was raised up, clenched into a fist, and strongly pushed forward.
Seeing that the two sides were about to collide, the dragon roar in Tang Wu Lin's body suddenly became intense, and a large golden dragon head with a diameter exceeding two feet appeared without warning, directly swallowing Yan Feng's right arm.
King Dragon Astonishing Heaven!
After eating Red Jade Shrimp that day, Tang Wulin's own qi and blood, although it couldn't break through the Fourth Seal of the Golden Dragon King, had been greatly enhanced, allowing him to become much more proficient in his control over the Golden Dragon's terrifying powers.
Yanfeng was also taken aback. She only felt a great force coming towards her and, immediately after, the punch she'd thrown was engulfed by flames, as if a giant pincer had caught her right hand.
Golden Dragon Claw unleashed its power, and the word armor on Yanyun's body lit up. All the flame patterns on it appeared alive, especially the Phoenix in the center of the chest moved and turned into a flaming phoenix, flying straight towards Tang Wulin's chest.
