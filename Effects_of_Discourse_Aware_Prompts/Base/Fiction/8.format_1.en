After carefully looking over the house, making sure there were no major issues, the decision was basically made and the rest was up to Nanfeng to find a real estate agent and talk to the original owner.
JuanMao is in a great mood today, he went out and had enough fun.
After swimming around in the sea and being called ashore, I still played with sand for a while, and when it was time to leave, the dog's eyes were fixed on the car window, full of reluctance.
Nan Feng saw the situation and smiled, "Don't worry, next time when you come, you can live in directly. You can play as long as you want then, you can go to the sea for swimming every day, and there are also small fish and shrimp to play with~"
Curly was pleased and lay in the car dreaming of a happy life to come.
What impression does Juanmao have of the ocean?
The impression of having a seafood buffet for free.
Its cheerful mood lasted until it returned to the dormitory.
After Nanfeng and two others left, Fang Zhao called for Juanmao to come and close the dormitory door, "Juanmao, come here."
The curly-haired one waggled its tail and came right over.
Have fun today?
Fang asked a question.
"Wang!"
Is that side fun?
Fang Zhao asked again.
The poodle jumped up and barked again, wagging its tail energetically.
Speak.
"It's fun!"
Barbels Way.
It can now switch languages fluently, with pronounced pronunciation.
Hmm.
Fang Zhao nodded, then opened the learning device.
Juanmao: "..."
He twitched his ears, shrank his paws, and thought he had sneakily stepped back.
Fang Zhao ignored its reluctance, opened the e-learning device and showed it a newly created folder, inside which were the newly purchased e-books.
Marine Environment Protection Law
The Teen Environmental Protection Knowledge Collection.
Catalogue of Marine Wildlife Protection
Marine Environment Management
One Hundred Oceanic Knowledge That the New Millennium Must Know
Oh sea, my home.
All books are related to the ocean, a total of twenty.
Not only does it have e-books, but there are also 20 sets of accompanying test questions.
Juanma: "...
Its ears drooped dejectedly.
"I know you read books fast, should you be even faster now?"
If you read all twenty books in the folder and get full marks on the corresponding twenty sets of questions, then you can go and play at the sea.
It is estimated that it won't take more than fifteen days to move, said Fang Zhao.
It's all rote knowledge, given Joon-Moo's memory and learning ability, getting full marks isn't that difficult.
Curly went to the sea, and Fang Zhao wasn't worried about its safety, but instead he was worried that Curly would eat some endangered species in the sea to extinction.
How large exactly is Curly's stomach, even Foo-Tah up to now is still unsure.
During the period of the Boar Star Record program, frizzle ate secretly in the desert and in the sea, but due to Fang Zhao's warning, Frizzle did not really open his appetite to eat.
After all, the stay of the star is not long, with the strict regulations in place, and the consideration of other people present, it can't steal too much food.
After they moved to the new home, Curly could go to the sea every day. If he wasn't kept in check, it would be equivalent to species invasion and he would upset the balance of this patch of the ocean's ecosystem with his strength as a single dog.
Fang Zhao got her to understand some things in advance—oceanic life has taken a lot of effort to return to its current state, so she cannot let Juan Mao ruin it.
Don't expect full marks, keep going and keep your study partner by your side!
This day, Southwind came to find Fang Zhaozhu because of the new house renovation.
As soon as Nanfeng entered the dormitory door, he saw the fluffy curl squatting there with a hanging dog head, and there were tears under the dog's eyes.
My steps faltered for a moment, the south wind taking my gaze away, to find my way to Fang Zhao and resolve the matters at hand first.
As for Curly, it's become normal and South Wind is able to take it calmly.
After discussing the renovation, Nanfeng remembered something he had seen today and said, "By the way, boss, did you know what happened online today?"
What's the matter?
Fang Zhaojin is writing his thesis today, so communication is set and nothing important will bother him.
There has been a lot of online discussions about him lately and many people have been looking for him, so Fan Zhao has had to set the do-not-disturb mode.
Do you know Wil's painting?
The south wind asks.
"Do you know, is it about William's graduation work?"
Will's graduation exhibition was visited and he got an A+ grade. One of his graduation works was a painting of a Shih Tzu, titled "The Dog Next Door".
The art exhibit has been over for two days- not to mention that Fang Zhao has been holed up in his dorm writing papers since morning; he really had no idea what's been going on online.
Nanfeng reported the information they had learned to Fangzhao.
As it turns out, after Will's graduation art exhibition, the school put his paintings on their website, which sparked a great deal of discussion.
Will successfully completed his study plan from last year - short-term goal draw square, long-term goal draw square's dog.
Will's painting "My Neighbor" had already created a hot online discussion when it was first posted, and some netizens even joked that Will had painted a portrait of an extraterrestrial.
This time, after "My Neighbor", "The Dog of the Neighbors’ House" has once again topped the hot search ranking of the day.
"The Dog Next Door" was the work that Will spent the longest time on, researched the most, and cost the most effort, and also the work he was most satisfied with.
This painting is similar to the style of the previous "My Neighbor" and looks more difficult to understand. At least from "My Neighbor", it is still possible to make out its individual pattern, but from "The Dog of the Neighbor's Home" it is impossible to make out a dog shape. If it weren't for seeing the name of the painting, no one would think that the figure in the painting is a dog or a small pet dog.
The richly vibrant colors, mysterious yet containing an air of grandeur, seem to transcend ordinary life yet one can hardly pinpoint why, and the more one studies it, the more one's heart will be filled with a trembling awe.
Is it so terrible to call that dog?
After seeing this painting, a student named Huang Yi recalled the little curly haired dog he had met in the campus, and searched for the breed on the Internet to make sure he had not remembered it wrong.
At this end, after listening to Fang Zhao's wedding concert, being able to analyze the person in Wil's painting up close is another kind of sentiment.
If I were to express my opinion, this painting gives me a feeling very similar to Fang Zhao's 'η'.
It is a bit beyond the comprehension of ordinary people.
Even if an amateur stands in front of this painting and watches it for a few seconds in silence, even if he/she does not understand anything, his/her heart feels fuzzy and his/her body can't help but shiver.
Online, the discussions are even more intense.
I noticed after he entered school for further studies, Will totally let his thoughts run free, something which we cannot understand.
"What grudge, what resentment! To draw the dog of Fang Zhao like this!"
The friend in front of us definitely has not seen Wil's previous painting, "My Neighbor". Let's take a look and see how Wil depicted the scene.
Maybe Will has been bitten by a dog, and has psychological fears of dogs, otherwise he couldn’t have drawn something so frightening!
"She made a cute little monster out of a drawing!"
This is art!
"The world of artists is indeed something that ordinary people like us cannot understand."
I stared at the painting for five minutes, but still couldn’t quite get a sense of what he was trying to say. Nonetheless, I still felt a sort of weird admiration and a peculiar feeling in my heart.
This kind of painting at a deeper level needs to be studied in detail.
"This painting is not going to sell, right?"
"You can also buy it back to ward off evil."
It's still worth investing in; keep an eye on Will, the painter, he's still young.
After Wil's paintings were displayed on the school's website, someone came to him to buy them.
The last bidder, a collector from Macau, purchased the painting "The Neighbour's Dog" at an extremely high price that far exceeded the pre-auction estimate of the Imperial Art Gallery.
Some people believe that the Puyuan collector is overly enthusiastic about curls, and when faced with curls, he seems to never be calm enough.
Some people think this is pure hype, not necessarily for Will himself but for the dog Fonz, the Moochau people's ways of dealing with dogs are indeed incomprehensible, as if they had lost their minds.
Regarding this, the Imperial State TV Painting and Calligraphy Channel specially dispatched someone to interview the person who made the expensive purchase.
When giving the interview, Muzhou collector stated: "Many people buy Wil's paintings but are only investing in the person Wil, not the paintings themselves."
I'm different - I look at paintings, of course, and also to the dogs in them.
I have a feeling that this painting will be sold at an exorbitant price in the future.
Seeing the little bear in the live interview: "The Muzhou people have a kind of terrifying intuition towards dogs."
Indeed, humans are a remarkable species.
Thus, Wil's painting of "The Neighbor's Dog" went viral, appearing on the front page of Royal Continent News.
After Nanfeng left, Fang Zhaofan flipped through the news online and said to Juanmao, "Don't go out over the next few days, and turn back home to study in five minutes."
"The test this morning only had 62 questions, let's review the section on animal protection one more time!"
Is whale edible?
"Coral cannot be eaten either!"
