This is to give you a feel of the breath fluctuations, really very simple. The other wizard couldn't help but interject with a laugh.
"Thanks for your help."
Lin Sheng nodded.
He needs to find the other fragments at the fastest speed, originally he planned to deal with more evil spirits from the government in order to gain more power of pure souls.
However, since such an opportunity has come now, the fastest way to get it is the king's way.
Soon, the Shaman leader led Lin Sheng to a gate of evil spirits.
The two of them reached out their hands and gently touched the frame of the Evil Spirit Gate, then closed their eyes.
The Mage quickly used his extraordinary abilities to begin constructing the spatial Foundation, establishing it as a set of coordinates.
Then, following the ritual oscillations of the Evil Spirit Gate, with Lin Sheng's perception consciousness together, they were emitted out by the ritual oscillations.
A typical teleportation ritual is a point-to-point directional teleportation.
But when we explore other spatial secrets, it is to transform this point-to-point into point-to-many.
"This only requires modifying a few small parameters on the transmission baseplate."
The sorcerer guided Lin Sheng's consciousness while imparting related skills at the same time.
In this way, the sinister door will spontaneously transmit our consciousness to multiple possible locations of similar target space.
It's basically using energy to take a gamble; if luck is on our side, then we could get the spatial frontier we want in one try, but if luck is not on our side, then we'll have to waste energy and try a few more times.
That's really quite random.
Lin Sheng was speechless.
As soon as his perception entered the Evil Spirit Gate, he was immediately enveloped by the ritual waves, radiating outward.
At the same time, it was as if he had split his consciousness; his awareness divided into more than ten parts, perceiving the atmosphere of more than ten completely different spaces at the same time.
Generally speaking, it is difficult to maintain the integrity of our consciousness in the transmission process, so we can only try to remember the spatial coordinates contacted by the main consciousness.
The memories of the coordinates need us to leave a simple mark...
The outsider magician continued to explain in a low voice while guiding Lin Sheng and teaching him how to make a simple mark to determine the coordinates code.
But he didn't expect that the consciousness of the Spirit Lock, because it was too powerful and tough, would be split into more than ten parts, and he could remember the coordinates of all the spaces that were touched by them.
It's just a matter of ten uses of one heart. For Linsheng, who can use one heart for N applications, it's nothing much. He's continually practicing the skill of dozens of uses of one heart every day.
Every summoned creature, he is able to control and observe through the split consciousness of the soul. So now although he cannot control many summoned creatures at the same time and let them act independently.
Just memory the fluctuations of the breath, and set coordinates accordingly.
On top of that, his soul itself is tougher than the average person and has a longer existence. This point is still very easy.
In ten minutes, the consciousness all dissipated and dispersed away.
Lin Sheng opened his eyes and looked at the several mages.
"Locate this coordinate to the secret realm of space for me." He immediately said out one of the special secret realm coordinates while the sorcerer captain and others gazed in astonishment.
This spatial secret realm of coordinates was exactly what Lin Sheng had felt, with a special space that was originally the same as the Yin-to-Evil Fragment in his embrace.
Did it succeed in one go?
The wizard had a bit of bitterness in his heart. It took him more than half a month when he first sensed the breath of space, determined the coordinates and made a record of it.
Very simple operation.
Let's start building the portal.
"I'm going to go," said Lin Sheng.
Yes.
Wait for the main body.
The spirit of Tiāngōng Xiá whispered to Lín Shèng, making him hesitate.
What?
He watched the Sorcerer Chief give orders to the evil spirits to transport materials and resources, then he stood aside and communicated with Tianguang Xia through telepathy.
Things are different over here compared to on the Seychelles, there has been a huge transformation!
The tone of Tian Gong Xia's words was slightly solemn.
This is a sign that Lin Sheng has never seen before.
If he had even told the existence of the King of Night to Tian Gongxia back then, she would never have been this serious.
This gave him a feeling of abnormal tension.
"Mizuki should be in an absolutely disadvantaged position, right?"
Lin Sheng frowned and asked.
"Is there a new addition to the fighting force?"
No, it's not a new combat force." Tian Gongxia said solemnly.
Instead, Miyue deceived everyone!
What's going on?
The Seven Lock Tower had already successfully summoned Faldor, deceiving all of the people of the Three Secret Realms. He had already succeeded in summoning him with himself as the sacrifice, and had completely merged with him!
Lam Sing-dun was feeling sluggish.
"Offer oneself as a sacrifice?"
"What a crazy person!"
Therefore, the three great secrets are now facing a fusion monster of Miyabi and Farudo.
Lin Sheng was speechless.
What should we do now?
Heaven's craft is dense, solemn and far-reaching.
Fabrizio merging with Miyako is not as simple as one plus one equals two, but rather a ending of three multiplied by ten.
Don't get excited.
For Miyatsuki and Faldo, their greatest enemy is still the Three Secret Realm and other formidable powers.
And the world is not as simple as you think.
Lin Sheng remembered the data he had obtained from the investigation he had done previously.
"The Great Star Pool and those who possess the heavenly artifacts are not simple characters."
As long as he doesn't provoke us, we don't care how they develop.
I understand your meaning.
"It's best to prepare in advance though," Tian Gongxia reminded.
I once had that level of destructive power. That was during the period I was controlled by the magical sword.
So I'm very clear, what kind of result would be caused by that level of power.
Silent Lin Sheng.
Of all his subordinates, Tiangongxia is the most special one. Because Tiangongxia has ever been influenced and controlled by some kind of special and powerful existence.
Back then, even in her memories, she could still feel Lin Sheng's gaze on her.
It's merely an image imprinted in my memory, yet I can still find Lin Sheng, peeking into my memories.
This level of power has exceeded Lin Sheng's comprehension.
"I understand," Lin Sheng answered again.
I will be prepared.
"Don't worry."
Well then, open up the strongest special state, summon all of the leadership power, and fuse it into one self.
He broke off the connection with Tiangong Xia and Lin Sheng quietly gazed at the newly-built Evil Spirit Gate. His thoughts returned to the original line of thought.
"It is ready. My lord." The sorcerer whispered.
Lin Sheng stared at the portal in silence for a moment.
"Bring the Fairy King over. Also, D'Gael!"
DeGaulle's magic hand had already arrived nearby, waiting.
Hearing the call, he came in from the doorway instantly.
"Your Highness, I obey your orders."
Lin Sheng nodded.
I want to open multiple portals at the same time and explore multiple dark dimensions.
You select one hundred of the Greater Demons, divide them into various teams, and set them out on a trial expedition.
"Yes, sir!"
DeGarall's heart skipped a beat, knowing something must have changed for his master.
Otherwise, a sudden and massive exploration would not be so urgent.
