The Asian-American community has filed complaints against three Ivy League schools, Yale included, for alleged discriminatory admissions practices - Xinhua News Agency
On May 23rd, Xinhua News Agency in Washington reported that more than 130 Asian-American groups submitted an appeal to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice, protesting the discrimination of Asian-American applicants in the admission process of the three Ivy League schools, Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Coalition, which is leading the appeal, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yu Kong, said at the press conference that over the past ten years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the criteria for admission to American universities has doubled, but in these three famous American universities, the proportion of Asians has remained roughly the same.
Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the so-called "holistic evaluation" process in a consistent and systematic manner.
Zhao Yu said that research by Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that among the three universities, Asian-American applicants relative to the total number of applicants had the lowest admission rate among all ethnicities.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented an effective racial quota for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yu-Kong told the Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope after submitting appeals, the US Department of Education and Department of Justice can initiate an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans after facts are ascertained.
They also expect the school that was complained to take the initiative to pay attention to this matter and to change their admissions policies toward Asian-Americans.
At present, the three universities which have been complained against have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had originally submitted a complaint against Harvard Universityâ€™s discriminatory admissions practice, but the US Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American organizations participating in this appeal, American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational organizations are also involved.
