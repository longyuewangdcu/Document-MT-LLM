After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman made a statement on Saturday (December 11th) saying that the US holding the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is "drawing a line of ideology, weaponizing and utilizing the tools of democracy, doing the opposite of democratization in the name of democracy, inciting division and resistance, and diverting domestic conflicts”.
The Chinese government believes that over the long term, the US has been imposing its political systems and values on others, promoting "democratic transformation," unilaterally imposing sanctions, stirring up "color revolutions," resulting in devastating consequences.
Democracy has already become a major weapon of mass destruction used by the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action for Biden to fulfill his election promise.
The two-day meeting was conducted over video and 111 global leaders were invited to attend, including the leaders of Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States itself for its democratic issues, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
Internationally and domestically in the United States there are voices of criticism, such as criticism of the invited leaders including some of those with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, among others. Some have questioned the real intent of the Biden Administration's organization of the summit, which is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Schröder also attended the video democracy summit.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's Saturday statement said, "Today's American democracy has shown its morbidity with the growing problems of money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social divisions, racial conflicts and wealth divide, etc., and that the democracy in the US has become a "rich man's game" built on capital."
In his speech, U.S. President Biden stated, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, fortify the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent accountability, better withstand the buffer and force of authoritarianism, and those who would brazenly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it among each generation, and in my opinion, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said, "At a time when global democracy and human rights are facing sustained and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The U.S. has promised to launch an action plan for one year after this summit of democracies, including an initiative of 424.4 million dollars to strengthen democracies around the world and to support independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical Democracy Summit scheduled to be held by the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report back on our progress next year."
