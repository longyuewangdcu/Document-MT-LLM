"Thinking about Education: How to Make College Exams Benefit Both 'Brainiacs' and 'Weaklings' - Xinhua News"
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about the university exams and proposing to raise the difficulty level, change the exam format, and make the exam truly reflect the students' actual level.
Indeed, for a long time, university entrance exams have been a "hot topic".
On college campuses, students come from all corners of the world, with varying abilities and levels of study, making for an incredibly diverse learning environment.
Assessing such a diverse group of people will inevitably lead to different feelings.
Of course, if the examination questions are single-type and have a high repetition rate and are too simple, it will certainly lead to a completely different feeling.
Students who don't study hard may be able to pass the exam with a concentrated attack before the exam. If they find other ways to study, they may get twice the result with half the effort.
Thus, there arises the "strange situation" where the "bad student", who usually doesn't spend much effort, passes the exams and even obtains high scores; while the "good student" who never misses classes, has perfect homework and notes, does not get a significantly higher score on the exam.
It appears that the Lanzhou Jiaotong University students' reflection on the problems in college exams is not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this level of meaning, we should give praise to the three students who wrote the letter directly.
Actually, people who have gone to college are all aware that it is not uncommon for those who resort to intensive preparation and various strategies to obtain exam questions from their teachers, seek to reduce the scope of the tests and obtain "special tutoring" before the test; even bringing small cheat sheets and begging their teacher for a favor after the test is not unheard of.
In my opinion, as an evaluation of teaching quality, the qualification or disqualification of an examination in a university is more about teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Upon entering the undergraduate stage, specialization began to further divide and many specialized courses mainly focused on foundational knowledge.
There is no doubt that the ability to master the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content tested in university examinations.
Generally speaking, undergraduate knowledge is mostly composed of basic theories and basic knowledge of disciplines. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not very large and is generally fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of mathematics learnt in university twenty years ago is still being learnt, and still remains important."
However, the knowledge points remain basically the same, which does not mean that the exam questions are single or repeated.
At many universities, an exam team will generally be formed, and papers will be composed by senior teachers in the discipline, with all the teachers responsible for the course participating in the marking of the papers. This is to a certain extent able to overcome the problem of the repetition of questions.
In order to formulate a set of test questions that meets the actual situation of teaching and learning, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and at the same time, an in-depth understanding of the teaching situation should be obtained to comprehensively analyze the studentsâ€™ level of learning, in order to dynamically grasp the difficulty of the exam and the types of questions, thus emphasizing the examination of basic knowledge while also considering the assessment of ability, and at the same time, carrying out innovative designs for the types of questions.
Examinations are the conductor of university education, whatever type of examination there may be, students will have the corresponding study plan and in the long run, it will have an effect on the efficacy of university education.
The university highly values the students' suggestions, and has already implemented a reform plan throughout the school.
Require teaching units to organize teachers to conduct discussions and course closing examinations for self-examination, formulate examination paper topics and related regulations, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper topics and review links, refine results assessment, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of all links of course teaching.
Solving problems such as single type of test questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is an important issue for colleges' exam arrangements, and of course, corresponding regulations need to be issued. However, the real effort should be made in our daily life. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only understanding the teaching content but also the student learning situation. Only with a comprehensive understanding from both sides, teachers and students can be better connected, forming a virtuous interaction and the exam will be more consistent with the actual situation, thus enabling the high achievers and the poor performers to receive equal rewards.
