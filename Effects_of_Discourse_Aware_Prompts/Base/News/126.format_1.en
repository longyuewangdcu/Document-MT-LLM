The 3,200 newborn babies in Sabah did not get birth certificates due to the shortage of anti-counterfeiting paper.
Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of the special anti-forgery paper stock, the issuance of birth registration papers to newborn babies has been halted since the beginning of October, with a cumulative total of 3200 affected people so far.
However, the director of the bureau, Kalu Aminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates are already in the system and will be issued the anti-counterfeit paper when it arrives next week.
He gave an explanation at the press conference regarding an article by a web media that had been reporting on the printing paper issue of the Sabah Daily for 10 months.
He said the issue had appeared two months ago, and Sarawak was facing the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, causing the delay of arrival in our country.
He explained that the security paper used by Sabah Newspaper was different from other areas, so it could not be borrowed from other states' stocks.
Keluamunis revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, return to Sabah for the final stages of printing immediately, estimated to take two working days (December 20) to hand it to the applicant.
We will notify the applicants to go to the local offices to collect the birth certificate.
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 birth certificates up until now this year.
