Education Information: Beijing Compressed Special Admission Ratio of Junior High School Students in 2016-Xinhua News
On the 21st and 22nd, Beijing's middle school admission exams for talented students were organized and implemented by the district's Education Commissions.
This year, all districts of Beijing have compressed the ratio of gifted student enrollment, making the competition for gifted students even more intense.
Taking Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of elementary school students entering junior high school this year as gifted and talented students should not exceed 5% of the total planned enrollment number, which is 380. The proportion of actual enrollments should not exceed 10% of the total planned enrollment number.
Students with talents in sports, performing arts, and science who have registered online are eligible to take the special talent admission examination.
In order to make it more convenient for students to take the exam nearby, Dongcheng District continues the same examination arrangement as last year and sets up 1-2 examination places in each school district, totaling 13 examination places.
Examination points are divided into test areas, with hours as the unit of division for time periods. Students will enter the examination points in the different test areas at the designated time periods to take the exam.
On May 23rd, the district education admission test center publicized the list of students who passed the exam on the internet, and students can check the exam results online.
