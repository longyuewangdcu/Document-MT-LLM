Within 48 hours, a negative result from the nucleic acid testing, a "buffer zone" proposed; the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council issued a document requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control in port cities.
The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control work of the new coronavirus pneumonia at the port and border cities, requiring those who recently left the port and border cities on land (except those connected with Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a nucleic acid test negative certificate within 48 hours, and those who go to the port and border cities on land must take at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of port cities in each province and region to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional ports cities may study setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their respective districts.
The responsible person from the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area and both parties have frequent exchanges.
Implement differentiated management policies according to region, replace one line of defense and prevention against spread with two, realize pre-emptively control entry points, compress risk of viral spread and the maximal effect of epidemic prevention with the least social influence and the lowest social cost.
In recent months, there have been multiple localized cluster outbreaks in China, all of which were imported through port cities from overseas.
The above-mentioned notice points out that this reveals some problems such as local epidemic situation monitoring and warning not being timely, personnel in high-risk positions not having closed-loop management effectively implemented, regular nucleic acid tests remaining merely formalities, cold chain articles not being thoroughly disinfected at each stage, centralized isolation premises not being managed properly, and epidemic emergency response not being scientifically and accurately enough.
The notice requires that effort be made in nine aspects including perfecting the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, establishing a monitoring and warning system for epidemics, and implementing border control measures, etc., in order to quickly fill in the weak links and gaps of epidemic prevention and control in port cities and to take prevention and control works without relaxation and in an accurate and scientific manner, and to fully safeguard the external defense line against imported cases.
The notice stresses that all port cities should synchronously research, deploy and publish hotlines for civilian protection, regularly inspect potential risks of the supply and prices of basic living materials, and promptly solve and actively respond to the prominent issues raised by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include counties (cities, districts, banners) with open land, water, and air ports, cities (prefectures, states, leagues), and directly-administered cities, with the definitive scope determined by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered city) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and promptly publicized.
