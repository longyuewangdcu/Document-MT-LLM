December 11th, a micro documentary titled "Murder Machines" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
This film tells the story of how the United States launched the war in Afghanistan under the pretext of "counter-terrorism" and forcibly exported American-style democracy, committing a variety of anti-humanitarian crimes for 20 years with its troops massacring countless civilians.
Misusing drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian places warps humanity and makes up killing squads.
For the past 20 years, the American military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up "black jails" to impose various tortures and personal humiliations on "suspects".
One case after another of crimes against humanity stirs up more hatred from the Afghan people.
As the video said, the US "war on terror" is "more anti-terror, more terror".
The war has not brought peace and democracy nor prosperity hopes to the Afghan people, only leaving behind a scarred country and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video, let's uncover together the bloody truth behind America's "anti-terror" campaign and the hypocrisy behind American democracy!
