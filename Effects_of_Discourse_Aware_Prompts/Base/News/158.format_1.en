Don't intimidate people at the starting line - Xinhua Net
When strolling through a book market, one often feels the popularity of books on success.
Nowadays, the success books preach many "best principles" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what it is that you need to do.
In other words, it skips the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
Thus, all of these books have one shared characteristic â€” to either strive hard and do your best or to do nothing at all; to either be a hundred or zero; to either ascend Mount Tai or to stay put.
This "best principle", which everyone acknowledges to be "absolutely correct", is so daunting that 99% of people get intimidated before even starting.
Because this theory promotes a path of "you have to make up your mind to start over and make a 180-degree change" which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
It is nothing but self-deception and fooling around to shout 'you need to change' in the ear of someone who is so set in their ways, refuses to change and insists on following tradition.
Most people become timid in the face of the word "transformation" and hesitate to take the next step and make a firm decision; or they make a sudden decision to "transform" and take the first brave step, but unfortunately this usually doesn't last long, and they soon give up, unable to continue.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "Start from Tomorrow," is the most vivid and classic presentation of this common human nature.
The biggest problem with "the best principles" is that the threshold is too high, often surpassing the ordinary people's ability limit, making most people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps "the second-best principle" is a way to bring more ordinary people to the path of relative success.
The core of the "next best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" -- it encourages a theory of "winning by small victories", that is, if you can't achieve 100, doing it only to 1 is okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb to the top of Mount Tai, it's okay to just climb the small hill in front of your house, because that is always better than standing in the same place.
In short, it's always better to do something than to do nothing.
Due to the reduction of threshold, the possibility of ordinary people persevering has increased, and as long as perseverance is maintained, the probability of success will also increase.
Just that following the path to success with the 'second-best' principle, its journey is slightly longer.
In short, although "the best principle" may seem to be for the success of everyone, it actually only effectively motivates a few, while the "next best principle" encourages more people to benefit from it as much as possible.
