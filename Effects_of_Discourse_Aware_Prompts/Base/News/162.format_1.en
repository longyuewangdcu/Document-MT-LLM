The reserves of Naked carp at Qinghai Lake increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporter Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang): It was learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserve of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources increased by 0.71 million tons this year over last year, reaching 108,500 tons, which increased more than 40 times over the initial stage of protection in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake naked carp , commonly known as “Huangyu” , is a precious species unique to Qinghai Lake, which plays an important role in ensuring the safety of the “ water-fish-bird” ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the large amount of human hunting, the deterioration of the environment for the naked carp spawning waters, and other factors, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. By 2002, the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake had been reduced to only 2592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as a endangered species in the "Red List of China Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the policy of lake closure for fish rearing and prohibiting any unit, collective and individual from fishing naked carp from Qinghai Lake and its main river and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, by means of artificial breeding and releasing, clearing the main inflow rivers and constructing scientifically reasonable "fish passages" and other measures, the continuous effort of protection is being increased, and the resource of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million cobia fry have been artificially propagated and released in Qinghai Lake, and its contribution rate to the restoration of Qinghai Lake cobia resources has exceeded 23%.
The Sanjiangyuan region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier, a water conservation and water resource area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area controlling the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Region and Qinghai Lake and to protect aquatic wild animals, as well as maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, Qinghai Province has launched comprehensive ban management systems of “a river, a lake, and a lake” for Yangtze, Yellow and Qinghai lakes since this year, issuing notices of ban on fishing.
