At the opening ceremony, the provincial leadership authorized the fourth batch of enterprises to carry the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark and welcomed the "Source of Hunan Red Tea" with cheers in Xinhua.
At the Xinhua Red Tea Pavilion, Fujian tea merchants spotted a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
The Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association, Wang Jun, said happily that the current epidemic situation and other factors have affected the tea market to a greater or lesser extent, but from the scene of the Tea Fair, there are endless highlights.
Newhua Red Tea adds a hint of red, imbuing it with tea culture connotations, increasing its popularity and igniting its trading, as the Xiang Tea Industry welcomes a new spring.
