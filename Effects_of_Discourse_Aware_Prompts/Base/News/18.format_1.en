Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting from this year, our city will pilot the “Modern Apprenticeship” talent training model in 60 middle-vocational schools, and students who are accepted for the pilot training will also have the status of an apprentice. After admission, they will be pre-recorded as employees by pilot enterprises.
The city education commission requires that the admission and employment process of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identities of apprentices as vocational school students and employees of enterprises be clarified. According to the principle of double selection, three-party agreements should be signed by apprentices, schools, and enterprises. For apprentices who are 16 years old but have not yet reached 18 years old, four-party agreements should be signed by apprentices, guardians, schools and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties as well as the specific post for apprentices' on-the-job training, teaching content, and rights and interests protection.
Encourage the trial schools to adopt modern apprentice overall forms to jointly carry out the pre-job training and reemployment training with cooperating enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform their talent cultivation mode.
The school and the enterprise jointly design a personnel training program, establish professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot scheme takes a training system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program. The top post internship is generally 6 months.
Enterprises should implement team-based management models in practical exercises, according to the characteristics of different professions, and one master can lead two to five apprentices to form learning groups to ensure that students can proficiently master the necessary skills of each rotation post.
According to the arrangements, from 2016 to August 2019, our city identified 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilot schemes in three batches, with each pilot about 50 people, training a total of around 3000 student apprentices.
Explore and establish a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint cultivation and integration of personnel training in schools and enterprises according to the principle of first piloting and then advancing from points to areas, so as to effectively enhance students' post skills, improve the rate and quality of employment for students.
