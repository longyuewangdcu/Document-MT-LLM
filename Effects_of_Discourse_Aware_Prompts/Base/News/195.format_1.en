China's Shahe curators join hands to hold Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency reported from Riyadh on December 12 (Reporters: Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan): The first contemporary art biennial of Saudi Arabia - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial - was officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participated in the exhibition.
This biennial exhibition is jointly planned by the Sharjah Biennial Foundation and UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, with Fei Yu, director of UCCA Beijing, as artistic director.
According to the curators team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Feeling the Stones to Cross the Stream", which symbolizes the reform strategies taken in the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the present situation of the development of Saudi society and culture.
This two-year exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six connected buildings presenting six individual units: "Crossing the River by Feeling Stones","Inheriting as an Experiment","Edging Thinking","Heading to the Public","Beautiful New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, works by 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of all this exhibition's exhibits, covering a variety of forms such as painting, installation art and performance art; 12 works by Chinese artists also attracted attention, and some artists use recycled materials in a novel way to create their works, for example, in Xu Bing's "Backstory Series: Endless Picture of Stream and Mountains" (2014), he recreated a classic landscape painting with discarded items.
Dilya El Bouni Biennial Foundation's CEO Barkley stated his hopes that this biennial exhibition will be able to establish an international dialogue, allowing audiences around the world to gain an understanding of Saudi Arabia's growing culture and creative communities, while strengthening the exchange of interaction.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biennial is twofold - to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and to allow Saudi audiences to be immersed in the contemporary art world."
It is understood that during the opening week of the biennial a series of lectures will be held and opinion leaders from the arts, curators and the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and development of contemporary art.
