The night sky has an invitation - the Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its peak on the 14th.
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, the Gemini Meteor Shower will arrive at its greatest on the 14th of December. Friends who like meteor showers can observe from late at night on the same day.
Beijing astronomers Anjiu photographed the Gemini meteor shower on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers' parent bodies are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini Meteor Shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is currently the second meteor shower known not to be birthed by a comet.
Xiu Liepeng, an astronomer and science popularization expert of the Tianjin Astronomy Society, said, just like the blockbuster movies of the Chinese New Year, the Gemini Meteor Shower generally appears at the end of the year and its "release period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
The meteor shower is famed for its large and steady flow and, together with the Geminids and the Perseids, is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini Meteor Shower is its slow meteor body speed, rich colors, and a considerable number of fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and astrophotography for beginners.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast from Tianjin City, took a photo of the Gemini meteor shower in Jizhou, Tianjin, on December 13, 2020.
The astronomical forecast shows that the Gemini meteor shower this year will reach its peak at around 15:00 on December 14th, with a ZHR (Zenith Hourly Rate, the number of meteors that can be seen per hour at the optimum observation point, directly overhead) of 150.

Last year, the Gemini meteor shower "Falling Petals" left a deep impression on people, but this year the Gemini meteor shower will be interfered with by moonlight, reducing its spectacle.
It is the 14th day of the lunar calendar on November 11th, a waxing gibbous moon, bright moonlight will cause interference to the observation, luckily the moon will set in the later part of the night, and at this time, the radiation of the Gemini meteor shower will elevate to a higher degree.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after midnight when the moon sets, but they should be sure to stay warm and safe.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
‚ÄùIt is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and an open view facing northeast in a suburb or rural area, then patiently wait until the moon sets and observe visually.
We should note that the Geminids meteor shower has a lot of meteors radiating in all directions, so there is no need to just watch the radiation point when observing it.
Friends who like photography should choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens to capture gorgeous pictures of a meteor shower, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Considering stability and sustainability, tripod, spare batteries and shutter cables are also indispensable.
