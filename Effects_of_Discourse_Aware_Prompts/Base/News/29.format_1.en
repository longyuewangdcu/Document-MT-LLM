South African doctor: Although Omique Rong has a high transmission rate, most are mild cases.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the South African variant of the novel coronavirus, known as Omnicron, results in milder symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
According to the Associated Press, as the new variant of Covid-19 spreads in South Africa, a medical organisation of more than 5,000 doctors in the Gauteng Province reports that the symptoms of the Covid-19 patients they are currently treating are mostly mild, including body aches and coughing, similar to those of the flu.
The director of the organization, Doctor Unben Pillay, states that he sees several dozens of patients every day, but none of them so far require hospitalization.
Pelley said, "They can manage their illness at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health issues, who are more vulnerable to developing severe complications from the coronavirus.
He said that compared to the last wave of Delta coronavirus, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will be admitted to the hospital within a few days.
Within two weeks after the first report of the Omnicoreg mutation strain in Southern Africa, other physicians also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take a few weeks to gather enough data, the doctor's observation and early evidence have provided some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases: in the recent weeks of hospitalized Covid-19 patients, only 30% had severe symptoms, half of that of the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospitalization time shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the recent Covid-19 patients, only 3% died, while in the early outbreak in South Africa, the mortality rate reached 20%.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, quoting data from the National Institute of Occulational Diseases and other reports, said: "At present, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder form of the disease."
He also said: "It's still early, we need to get later data.
Normally, hospitalization and death occur later, but we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks.
At the same time, scientists around the world are monitoring case numbers and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delterta is still the primary strain of the novel coronavirus globally, the cases of Omnicok Rong are now appearing in dozens of countries, and South Africa as the epicenter of the pandemic.
According to health officials, there was a 400% increase in new cases found in the first week of December in Hoden Province, and tests showed that the Omikron Funk variant accounted for more than 90%.
