At the Zhejiang University academic annual meeting, students singing the leading role, the research results made people's minds open up widely.
At the opening ceremony of the 2016 Academic Conference of Zhejiang University yesterday evening, a series of brain-storming academic achievements were applauded.
The main researchers of these results are mostly students, covering a wide range of fields such as environment, mechanical, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities and education. Starting from one curious idea, students have created many high-end inventions with application values, some of which have been awarded domestically and internationally.
Biological Sensor: Your Home Physical Exam Doctor
Zhang Diming, a doctoral student from the School of Biomedical Engineering, presented a smartphone-sized bio-sensor, half the size of a smartphone.
You just need to take a light breath and this instrument will be able to detect your health condition based on the components of your exhaled breath.
Zhang Diming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to the smart phone, and after breathing out, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart wearable devices on the market which can detect health condition usually measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses graphene, a new type of material, as its target, with its sensitive "smell" enabling it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent operation light: High-energy eyes for doctors.
In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgery lights have been introduced in the operating room.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei's team from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED no shadow surgical lamp.
Many illnesses are detected too late or removed improperly due to the type of light used in doctor's operating rooms.
Shen Junfei said that for example, in the early stage of cancer screening, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissues in time, then the cancer cells will spread afterwards.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four light discs, which can enhance the distinction between different tissues in light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits at any time.
This intelligent surgical light has been trialed in Zhejiang University Medical School Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital, Zhejiang University Affiliated Children's Hospital and other hospitals, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
"Use air to wash your hands: it's water-saving and cool."
Ordinary people just use water to wash their hands, at most rubbing some soap, squeezing out hand sanitizer, while Li Qi Zhang and other classmates have invented a set of "air hand washing device".
Once we stand on the dispenser station, our weight will compress the air out.
‚ÄùIt's like a puffer.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the tap, blending together with the water.
"That way, we can get our hands clean!"
The coloration reaction and bacterial residue experiment proved that the effect of washing hands through this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a driving force, which can not only guarantee the cleaning degree but also save 90% of the water, and the entire process is completely energy-free and energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
At last year's Second Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention stood out among many world-leading universities, winning the only gold award.
