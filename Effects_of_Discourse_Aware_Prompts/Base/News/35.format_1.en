Education Times Commentary: What can save abducted children?
Using the famous public utility slogan "No trade, no murder", without the demand for abduction in a good environment, group prevention and group control, as well as everyone's anti-kidnapping will make it unprofitable, risky and costly, which will lead to fewer incidences of this type of crime.
Recently, the Child Missing Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been launched online.
This is an authoritative channel established to publish information on missing children, and an Internet information platform established in a timely manner to recover abducted children.
Hearing the name of this app is "TuanYuan", I feel the utmost warmth.
New technological means not only bear the name of "art" filled with emotion and sentiment, but also have a proper application of information technology, which is practical and effective.
Enforcement of anti-trafficking, the primary objective is to find the kidnapped children and protect their physical safety and freedom.
Next comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment can be listed a lot of "big words", from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education.
But before the trafficking case was cracked, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
Differentiate between important and urgent matters; under the urge of “rescue”, topics of various opinions and great controversy such as “should child trafficking be punishable by death” can be put aside for careful discussion; however, rescuing trafficked children must not be ignored.
According to the investigation experience for this kind of cases, human traffickers tend to leave the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
If we delay the anti-trafficking action for just one minute, the child could have a greater chance of getting further away from their parents and case resolution will become more challenging.
In this case, taking out measures such as the "Reunion" platform that directly helps to crack cases and find missing children is a practical action.
After all, "cracking down on kidnapping" is a major task that requires the whole legal system to be operational.
Fighting crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the perfection of legislation, to judicial protection, and the meticulousness of law enforcement, all need to carry out the care of "protecting the young and the weak".
Furthermore, prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family level all the way to the societal level.
For example, a common case, a family of three resting at the train station, the parents deep in sleep and woke up to find the child missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have considerable awareness of protection.
The minimum measures of preventing children from being abducted are for either of the parents to take turns to rest, or to place the child under safe protection.
From another perspective of the police cracking down on trafficking crime, buyers of trafficked children should also be paid attention to punishment.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the minimum sentencing point of the crime of trafficking in children is five years; in cases of especially severe circumstances, capital punishment may be imposed, with confiscation of property.
The starting point for sentencing is high and the maximum sentence is heavy, under the trend of "leniency", the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to a crime with heavier punishment.
There are still a substantial number of abduction cases occurring every year until now.
It is apparent that some people have outdated notions of parenting and a weak legal awareness.
Legal education for this group of people should be kept up to date.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, official strictly law enforcement alone is not enough.
If the "market" for human trafficking is widely prevalent and traffickers are driven by their greed and are constantly innovating the means of trafficking, a "struggle for the law" between them and the enforcement agencies will inevitably lead to an inefficient quagmire for the anti-trafficking efforts.
Therefore, eradicating outdated concepts and popularizing legal knowledge can also help to combat the crime of trafficking and purchasing of children.
