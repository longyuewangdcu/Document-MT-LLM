The Democratic summit ended with Biden proclaiming that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished.
The online 'Summit for Democracy' convened by US President Biden and attended by government leaders, civil society and private sector representatives from 110 countries around the world concluded on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fires of freedom burn in the hearts of people across the world and that autocratic regimes can never extinguish them.
He also expressed his intention to hold the second Global Democracy Summit next year.
Taiwan government representative, the political affairs committee Member Tang Feng and the current Hong Kong democratic human rights activist, Luo Guancong who is in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how hard the task before us is."
But we also know that we can embrace the challenge, for as I have said before, as this summit has demonstrated, the democratic world is everywhere.
Autocratic regimes can never extinguish the faint flame of freedom; it burns in the hearts of people all over the world.
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the whole society.
He said, "As government leaders, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrails of democracy, advance reform, achieve transparent accountability, provide a buffer and force against authoritarianism, and people who are brazenly seeking power before the public interest."
The main topics of the second day of the "Democratic Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, and counteracting digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day happened to coincide with 'International Human Rights Day'.
In his opening remarks of the day, the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also noted that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
He said: “Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and stances, as well as the resilience of democracy.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequity, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Nathan Law delivered a pre-recorded video speech at the summit to remind participants to continue paying attention to the human rights situation of minority ethnic groups such as the Uyghurs in China and Tibet.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise but there hasn't been a mechanism set up to hold it accountable."
This is why political figures and leaders in civil society have to work together.
We must utilize all that we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority.
Luo Guancong also called on the Free World to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to offend General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose access to the Chinese market, and maybe some of you haven't realized the threat the Chinese Communist Party poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason why we must change.
At the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Autocracy and Affirming Democratic Values", Minister of the Taiwan Executive Yuan Tang Feng issued the National Statements through video, emphasizing Taiwan's position at the forefront of resistance to authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared his experience in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing transparency and mutual trust through information.
He said: "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments in various places have justified the infringement of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, signaling a global democratic retreat.
However in Taiwan, we don’t need to shut down the city to control the epidemic, nor do we need to take down false information to win the battle.
At the same time as the second day of the "Democratic Summit" was underway, the U.S. Department of Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries such as China and North Korea which had been deemed to have seriously violated human rights, while investment restrictions were also imposed on a Chinese company which had been determined to be using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
