The girl acting as a target for her sister to solicit donations thought: "It's better that it only hurts the flesh and not the heart."
At Hangzhou Wulin Square, a girl stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human Target, Ten Yuan Per Arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a Hangzhou girl volunteering to be a fundraising target for her sister went viral on social media.
The photos show that a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square is standing in front of a large wooden board that is slightly higher than a person. On the board is written "Human Target, 10 yuan for one arrow", indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow for shooting after paying.
This action sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Yesterday evening, the publicity officer of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Lower-town Branch confirmed to the New Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl took such extreme action for her sister's fundraising, but such behavior is not worthy of promotion. After being warned, the girl had already left the local police station yesterday.
The girl on the street was warned for collecting donations for the "arrow target" fundraising.
In the circulated pictures, a long-haired girl stood in the shape of "ä¸ª" in front of a large wooden board, on which were written in black ink "Human Target, Ten Yuan per arrow". On the other board in front of her were written her bank account number, WeChat and Alipay accounts and so on.
The picture became controversial after it was posted online.
Some netizens think it is "begging for attention", and many sympathize with it.
We discovered the situation when we were patrolling around the square at about 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd. At that time there were already many people watching.
Police from the TianShui police station near the location of the incident said in interviews with local media that there were two girls hawking, both around the age of 20 and dressed in a youthful and beautiful manner.
Among them, the girl who acted as a human target was crying continuously, asking passersby to play the game; another girl was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's elder sister had leukemia, and now urgently needed money for surgery, and asking everyone for help.
We got in touch with the local police in Guizhou and found out that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukaemia treatment.
Yesterday evening, the publicity officer of XiaCheng branch of HangZhou City Public Security Bureau told reporters from New Beijing Newspaper, the girl is named Ji Jiali and they are raising donations for her sister, Ji Jiayan.
But since the treatment still required more than 300,000, they could not think of a good way to raise funds and so they had to do this behavior.
He said that throughout the process, two girls, one as a target and one as a shooter, but didn't participate in it. No arrows were found during the process, just some people watched and took photos, which were posted on Weibo.
After police verification, the bow and arrow used are not classified as controlled items.
The responsible person stated, "We don't advocate this kind of strategy for fundraising."
After being warned by the police officers at the police station, she has left the police station.
