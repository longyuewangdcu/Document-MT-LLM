Jiexin advocates rational consumption for consumers ahead of the "Double 12" - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website.
This year on "Double Eleven" shopping spree, the total amount of online payment transactions across the country reached 17.7 trillion yuan, creating a new high compared to previous years.
The various discounts and red packets, the eye-catching live broadcasts bringing with goods that have again make consumers exclaim of their benefit, the strong wave of consumption both awes people because of the strength of national consumption power and make them stop to ponder the impact of consumerism on society and the current mainstream consumer group.
Before the arrival of "Double Twelve", Credit China FinTech Holding Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Credit China”) issued a call for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and consumption habits, and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Analysis Report on Consumer Financial Literacy Survey" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, up 2.04 compared with 2019.
Generally speaking, Chinese citizens have performed well in terms of financial consumption, but there is a great disparity when it comes to financial behavior and skills, thus further improvement of the basic financial knowledge is necessary.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and the youth is relatively low, and “one old and one young” is still the focus of continuous financial education; Nielsen’s report on the debt status of young people in China and CCTV Finance’s 2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report showed the great consumption potential of the younger generation, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although young people generally show a trend of rational consumption, which is contrary to the external label of "excessive extravagance", some young people still have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behaviors, resulting in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even leading to the gradual increase of social problems. Financial enterprises should bear the social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, CreditEase has always been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, proactively responding to regulatory calls, and taking practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young groups.
In the past few years, China CITIC Bank has conducted multi-faceted, diversified financial knowledge popularization activities targeting young people, including college students, and has tacitly guided the consumption needs of the young group through various forms such as innovation practice competitions in cooperation with top universities in China, helping them to establish a rational consumption concept, to plan the consumption needs reasonably, and to accumulate wealth for their life.
As Double 12 approaches, Jiexin reminds all consumers and friends to establish a reasonable consumption awareness and a correct attitude towards money, resist blindly consuming and excessively consuming, avoid the misunderstanding of using credit for purchases, in order to avoid influencing their personal credit and economic life in the future.
When consuming, one must plan ahead and act within one's means to repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded on the individual credit report, which may have an adverse effect on economic life such as purchasing a car and buying a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose regular institutions and channels and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, E-CONSUMER will continue to rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated financial products to bring more demand-oriented and diversified services to consumers, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers develop the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a consumer financial partner that can be trusted for life.
