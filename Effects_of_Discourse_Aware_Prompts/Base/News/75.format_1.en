Vietnam People's News Network - Cooperation Council for the Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges.
The stays of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this marks the first visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis caused by the embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies in mid 2017 on Qatar.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, imposed a complete embargo on it, accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously undermined the internal unity of the ASEAN, resulting in negative economic effects on the countries in this region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only solved in the 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January, with the Gulf states signing an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait on the path towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its borders with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are pioneering efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors from both countries in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab states resolving the divide in order to restore relations with Qatar comes from the requirement of unifying for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, aimed at addressing shared challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf countries.
A 725 km long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenience for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest five billion US dollars in Oman, and the two countries' businesses have signed 13 cooperation memorandums of understanding of a value of thirty billion US dollars.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and major world powers on the Iranian nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a deal which the Gulf Arab countries had denounced as incapable of resolving the issue of Iran's missiles.
The Gulf countries have long viewed Iran as a "competitor" and its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that it is flawed not to resolve the Iranian missiles issue and to not take action to contain Iran's activities in the region.
Against the backdrop of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to meet the desires of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia engaged in direct negotiations with Iran.
Its goal is to restrain the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors contributing to the growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council states' economies.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council Summit will be the first summit of GCC countries since the dispute between some of its members and Qatar has been resolved.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess diplomacies that contribute to restoring GCC unity and propose measures for its member countries to cooperate fully in responding to common challenges and contribute to stability and development for the Gulf countries.
