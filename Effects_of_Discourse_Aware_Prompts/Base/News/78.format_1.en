Let college spirit resonate with the spirit of the times-Xinhua News
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational principles and values accumulated over the development of a university, which constitute the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present day, the spirit of the university has been of paramount importance for the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and society, and even for the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which rose up in the fall of national crisis, their spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concepts of "enlighten morality and benefit the world, cultivate integrity and govern in a peaceful way" and taking on patriotism to "benefit the country through promoting learning".
Currently, the trends of higher education informatization and internationalization are becoming increasingly obvious, and educational, technological, and talent competitions in a global scope are intensifying. As an important "supply side", higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
Especially the proposal of "Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines" further demonstrates our confidence and determination in transitioning from a nation of strong higher education to one of excellence, as well as puts forward higher and new requirements for university development.
How can we make effort in a short time to join the ranks of the world's first-class, and on the basis of the existing gap, speed up the construction of a number of world-class universities and a group of world-class disciplines, to achieve "bending overtake"?
In addition to having firm goal confidence, path confidence and capability confidence, universities should also give full play to three advantages: one is their late mover advantage, by continuously introducing overseas outstanding academic personnel, learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, so as to significantly improve their academic level and the quality of school running; two is their cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization that has been accumulated for five thousand years, promoting and developing excellent traditional cultures, to thereby consolidate power, shape brands and boost image; three is their institutional advantage, harnessing the advantage of being a socialist country, strengthening goal-oriented driving, aggregating consensus and strength, optimizing resource allocation and providing sustainable solid safeguards for accelerating the catch-up to the worldâ€™s advanced level by the school.
Special attention should be paid to the fact that it is impossible for all world-class universities to be the same; while each university should play to its strengths, it must also present its own individual character and features.
School features should reflect both the common Chinese characteristics and the unique objectives, educational traditions and resource endowments of each school.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we emphasize three aspects in our school operations: Firstly, we give emphasis to the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated environment integrating science and education and school-enterprise cooperation, forming an entire chain entrepreneurial education system. Secondly, we emphasize the gathering of interdisciplinary characteristics and promote the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, creating an institutional environment for interdisciplinary subjects. We actively cultivate emerging interdisciplinary subjects and distinctive interdisciplinary achievements. Thirdly, we emphasize the system of running a school and social service characteristics, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a collaborative system of production, study, research and cooperation throughout Zhejiang.
In this process, what is particularly important is to always adhere to the spirit of the university, so that the spirit of the university resonates in tune with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth from Facts and Pursuing Innovation", the core values of "Diligence, Self-improvement, Discernment and Dedication", and the integrated expression system of Zhejiang University spirit that "Absorb rivers from the sea and open the truth; cultivate one's character and core virtue; further studies and benefit the public; build bright future for our country" constitute its latest embodiment.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of school running, to continually accumulate cultural heights and to condense spiritual strength, with enriched connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusion, demonstrating the idea of "using talents from all over the world"; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and goodness, which means that colleges should always pursue the truth, while accepting the cultivation of conduct and tempering of character; "Kai Wu Qian Min" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes knowledge pursuit and scientific research innovation, as well as reform and development, innovation; "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means universities should always share the same honor and disgrace with the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year education establishment.
The intelligent listen in the absence of sound, and the wise perceive what is yet to take form.
China's universities must, in accordance with the whole situation of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, profoundly understand their place in the era and the historical mission they bear, so they can speed up the process of building world-class universities.
At the same time, keeping humanistic care and independent freedom and letting the university spirit exchange ideas with the spirit of the times and national spirit, thus provide power for achieving national prosperity, national rejuvenation and human common ideal.
