Under the suppression of mortars, the military base was in chaos. No one noticed a special force team sneaking in.
Without expending extra effort, Kutpov placed a beacon on the target then withdrew from the base with the team. After they safely arrived at the evacuation point, they called for an airstrike.
Soon, the Russian stealth bomber whizzed through the clouds, and the four bombs landed precisely on the two ammunition depots and two fuel depots at the base. 
The shock wave of the explosion was sent through the entire base and collapsed the concrete buildings around the points of impact.
The exploded ammunition and burning fireballs were sent scattering across the camp and caused a series of chain explosions. Flames, blood, and corpses were everywhere. 
The guards stationed at the base suffered severe casualties, and the rest were injured.
Medical soldiers with stretchers rushed inside the base. They searched for the wounded and immobilized. 
The engineer soldiers with heavy explosion-proof suits rushed into the flames to pull out any unexploded ammunition from the ruins. 
All the soldiers who could still move began to mobilize while they searched for their missing team members.
Sardes looked at the fire outside the window, and despair gradually appeared in his blank pupils.
Smoke covered the entire base. Flame stained the entire night sky red. The scene resembled doomsday.
“Sh*t…” 
Sardes muttered to himself. He moved his heavy legs and slowly left the window.
When he turned around, his eyes met his advisor’s eyes.
“Sir, what should we do?”
The explosion finally stopped. There were no more chain reactions at the base. However, nobody could be calmed. The mercenaries who escaped from the explosion knew it was just the beginning of their nightmare.
The previous explosion seemed to ignite a signal and signaled an attack from the Sami Army. 
Under the orders of Jiang Chen, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity. He jumped in front of everyone and brought all the remaining refugees to the frontlines.
More than six thousand people charged into the tundra, into the burning pines.
It was a spectacular scene.
At the same time, looking at the smoke rising from behind the base, all the mercenaries fighting on the front lines were panicking. Their previously-boosted morale dropped to rock-bottom in an instant. 
Even if they could defend their position, they were unwilling to fight.
Without any suspense, Arrow’s defense line was penetrated, and the uncooperative mercenaries collapsed in front of the Sami Army. 
Some of them fled back to the burning base, but most of them deserted and fled deep into the woods.
Jiang Chen didn’t need to remind them since even a pig would know what to do next.
Jiang Chen watched as Sami began to launch an attack on the military base then he put away his binoculars. He took out an off-road motorcycle from the storage dimension and patted Ayesha’s back gently.
“It’s time, let’s go.”
“Mhmm!”
Ayesha nodded, and after Jiang Chen sat on the motorcycle, she also hopped on behind him.
The engine roared and the belt shattered the snow.
Jiang Chen rushed down the hillside and turned to the side of the military base. He then parked the motorcycle on the side, took out a laser sword from the storage dimension, and stroked it in his hand. The barbed fence was shredded easily.
The entire base was immersed in fire and chaos, and there were still explosions from mortars from time to time. All the mercenaries fought on the front line and fought with the refugees for control of the entrance. 
Except for a company guarding the command center, no one was in the rear.
For Jiang Chen and Ayesha, it was no different than having no defense.
A total of ten guards—two guards standing in the sentry tower, and the remaining eight were stationed at the entrance of the first and second floors. 
Ayesha took out the Ghost Sniper Rifle and quietly took down the two guards standing in the tower then used blind spots in their field of vision to kill the eight people upstairs and downstairs one by one.
When Ayesha took care of the guards, Jiang Chen took out a rifle and moved to the command center. Just as he passed the Hummer at the entrance, he just happened to bump into Sardes and his advisor fleeing.
When their eyes met, both sides stopped.
The advisor first responded and immediately pulled out his gun, but he didn’t reach them in time before Ayesha pinned him down. 
Sardes was trying to resist but was easily controlled by Jiang Chen and his hands were pinned against the Hummer.
“Sardes, male, 43.” 
“The general manager of Arrow and the highest commander. Am I right?”
Although it was the first time they were meeting, Jiang Chen’s holographic helmet, which was connected to the Ghost Agent’s database, stored photos and personal information related to Sardes.
His information was projected onto the holographic screen.
Sardes’ face was pressed against the hood of the vehicle. He was certainly tough as he was reluctant to surrender. He gnashed his teeth.
“I won’t say anything. Just kill me…”
“Kill you?” 
“I didn’t ask anything yet.”
Jiang Chen grinned and smiled. He didn’t care about Sardes’ uncooperative attitude. Jiang Chen freed his right hand, pulled out a needle and injected it into Sardes’ back.
“AHHHH!”
Sardes growled in resistance. His eyes began to look bloodshot, and soon, the light in his pupils faded. 
Jiang Chen simply let his hands go. No ordinary person could resist the truth-telling serum.
Jiang Chen turned Sardes around and asked one word at a time.
“Where is Carmen?”
“Underground research institute in the underground bunker…”
“Where is the underground bunker?”
“The entrance is in the middle of the base and can only be accessed through the elevator.” 
“There are two aprons next to the entrance.”
Jiang Chen soon got the information he wanted.
“Good, now your wish has been granted.”
Jiang Chen took out a pistol and ended him then tossed his body aside.
It was a quick way to die, but for the well-known Arrow general manager Mr. Sardes, death in this obscure form might be more painful than death itself… if the dead felt pain.
“The underground bunker?”
Looking at the center of the base, Jiang Chen sneered.
No matter what Carmen was plotting, his good fortune should be over. 
The fate of the Rothschild family would end as it began, fame because of a war, obscurity because of a war…
However, at that moment, there were fierce screams from the distance.
