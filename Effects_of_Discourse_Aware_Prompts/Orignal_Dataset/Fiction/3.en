“What are you people doing!?!” 
Old Mr. Donggong hollered angrily while knocking his walking stick against the ground.
“Our ancestor is almost here. Mr. Donggong, please don’t get too impatient. You’ll find out what we’re going to do soon enough.”
Old Mr. Donggong knew exactly who “ancestor” referred to.
He was at a sudden loss for what to do, and he had no idea why Pei Yi was here.
It was not a wise decision to go against the DK Organization. Although everyone in R Nation wanted to annihilate them, it was practically impossible.
It was a far-fetched idea.
A few minutes later, Pei Yi’s car arrived.
He alighted from his car and shifted his gaze onto the car that An Xiaoning was in.
An Xiaoning alighted from the car without removing her wig or mask.
Wu Lianzhi followed suit.
“You’re here,” said An Xiaoning.
Pei Yi scanned her from head to toe and chuckled before walking toward her. He inched even closer toward her and said softly, “I doubt those people can recognize you under this disguise.”
“Of course. I did this just so they wouldn’t find out my identity. It’s not yet time for me to reveal my identity. That’s the reason I got you to come here.”
Pei Yi glanced at Wu Lianzhi and asked An Xiaoning, “Why are you with him?”
“For some issue.”
He stood up straight, turned around, and said to the members of the Donggong family with a smile, “Just what did my younger sister do to your family? Why did you have the audacity to try and kill her?” 
“Are you people tired of living?”
The members of the Donggong family turned pale the instant that they heard his words. Pei Yi’s sister? 
Since when did he have a sister?
Old Mrs. Donggong said, “We really had no idea… that she’s Mr. Pei’s sister.”
“I’m telling you now that she’s my sister.” 
“Did you hear me?” Pei Yi said coldly.
“Since you’ve said that she’s your sister, please take her away, Mr. Pei. As for Donggong Lianzhi, he’s a member of my family and his name is registered on my family’s ancestral records. He’s still part of the Donggong family, so it’s up to us to decide what to do with him.”
Before Pei Yi answered, the quick-witted An Xiaoning hurriedly said, “Brother, he’s my boyfriend and I’m carrying his child now. We can’t abandon him.”
Pei Yi initially wanted to take only An Xiaoning away, but things turned out to be trickier than what he had expected.
However, there was nothing the tyrannical Pei Yi couldn’t do, as long as he wanted to do it.
“Old Lady, you heard her. This man… could be considered as my brother-in-law now. They already have a child now. If I let you guys have him, wouldn’t the child be fatherless?” 
“Do you think I’d agree to that?”
Old Mrs. Donggong knew clearly that if she were to let Pei Yi take Wu Lianzhi away, it would be impossible for her to get rid of her grandson openly from now on. Hence, she refused to budge, despite fearing the DK’s authority and power.
“Mr. Pei, I’m afraid we can’t let you have him. Our family has our own set of rules. No outsiders are allowed to intervene when we’re punishing the members of our family.”
“Like I said, he’s the father of my sister’s child. Are you deaf?” 
Pei Yi then looked at Wu Lianzhi and said, “Are you a member of the Donggong family?”
“When my mother delivered some poisoned dishes to me this morning, I had already severed all ties with her. Prior to this, the Donggong family tried to kill me, Ms. An, and her subordinates under the facade of it being an accident. I already knew then that I’m no longer a member of the Donggong family, although it says so in the official records. My last name is now ‘Wu.’ My name is Wu Lianzhi. I no longer belong to the Donggong family!”
His words were cold, harsh, and full of impact.
The fact that he had the courage to make such a declaration in front of everyone just went to show that he was determined to cut ties with his family.
Old Mrs. Donggong barked, “It’s not your call! Once you’ve become a member of the Donggong family, you always will be!”
“Old Mrs. Donggong, may I ask you something? Now that Ms. An is already aware of your attempt to kill her, aren’t you afraid that she would intervene too?” 
Wu Lianzhi said dauntlessly in an austere tone.
Pei Yi smiled and chimed in, “I do know Ms. An personally, and she’s definitely one to take revenge where it’s due. You guys tried to kill her. Do you think she would take it lying down?”
“Okay, enough with the crap. My time is precious. I’m taking both of them away with me.”
Noticing that the members of the Donggong family were about to speak again, he added, “You should know what to do if you don’t want there to be any bloodshed.”
Hence, the Donggong family watched as their meticulously-premeditated plan backfired.
Old Mr. and Mrs. Donggong were beyond exasperated.
Finally, Old Mrs. Donggong said, “Forget it, forget it. We’ll just remove his name from the family records and the household register!”
“We have to go back to S Nation.”
Pei Yi gave her the side-eye and gibed, “Are you burning the bridge after you crossed over it?”
“Didn’t you say that you’d promise me something? I haven’t even informed you of my request and yet you’re already intending to return to your country?”
“I just have something important to handle back home, but I meant it when I said that I would agree to one of your requests. Tell me, what do you have in mind?”
“Hmm, my request might put you in a difficult spot…”
“Don’t bring it up, then. Give me another request that won’t put me in a spot.”
Pei Yi turned to look at her and said, “You really haven’t changed at all. Accompany me for half a month.”
“How?”
“Like you used to in the past.”
Gazing at him, An Xiaoning refused, “That can’t do. Firstly, I don’t want to be chained and have my freedom restricted. Two weeks is too long. I’m fine with two days.”
The smile on Pei Yi’s face stiffened a little and he chastised, “You’re going overboard with the bargaining. Five days, no fewer than that. Since you agreed to let me make my request, you can’t go back on your word. I’ll definitely let you have your freedom.”
“Can you let me return home first, then?”
“No.”
After hearing their conversation, Wu Lianzhi could not help but wonder, Are they in a relationship?
Is it a complicated one?
Why does it sound like it?
If they’re really in a relationship, they’re being too brazen in front of me.
An Xiaoning negotiated, “Let him return to S Nation while I stay at your place. Will that do?”
“I won’t do anything to you guys. He may come along,” Pei Yi said insistently.
An Xiaoning did not argue any further.
They arrived shortly after they left the Donggong family mansion, because it was not too far away from Mount Qingping.
An Xiaoning was filled with a mix of emotions.
Qin Guo was overwhelmed with displeasure the instant she saw An Xiaoning. After they entered, she immediately rolled her eyes in annoyance.
Why did Ancestor bring this jinxed troublemaker back again?
