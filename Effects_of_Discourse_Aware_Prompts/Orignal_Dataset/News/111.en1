Reflection on education: How can college examination make “super scholars” and “study slackers” have their proper places - Xinhuanet
Indeed, college examination has always been a “hot topic” for a very long time.
Students in campuses are from all corners of the country, with varied abilities and levels, as well as different learning conditions due to varied learning degree.
It is unavoidable that there are different feelings on the examination on groups with such diversified characteristics.
Of course, single question types, high repetitive rate and excessively simple questions will lead to another totally different feeling.
Students who do not study hard can pass the exam with focused review before exam; if they have other methods, they may half the work with double results.
In this way, “study slackers” can pass exams or even with high scores although they do not study hard; however, “super scholars” have scores not obviously higher than “study slackers” although they attend each class and do well in assignments and notes.
In this way, the reflection of the problems in college exams by students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University is reasonable; it is believed such status does not exist only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this point, the 3 students who wrote the letter shall be praised.
In fact, all people who have been to colleges know that there are frequent phenomena of focused review, “extracting” exam questions from teachers, knowing the scope of the questions and acquiring the “key coaching” before exam; even more, there are phenomena of bringing notes to exam rooms or begging teachers to give high marks after exams.
According to the author, as a tool for teaching quality evaluation, in order to measure if the college exam is qualified or not, it is on comprehensive mastering on teaching and learning by teachers, as well as the scientific questions on this basis.
Specialties are divided in details after entering into the undergraduate college stage, and many specialized courses are taught based on basic knowledge.
Without a doubt, the comprehensive mastering of the basic knowledge points of a specialty is the content to be inspected by college exams.
However, the knowledge of the undergraduate courses is basically basic specialty theory and basic commonsense, with not much space for changes from the point of view of knowledge points, which is basically fixed.
Just as what teachers said, “the basic knowledge of university mathematics 20 years ago is still key point at present. ”
However, no change in knowledge points does not represent for single exam question types and repetition of questions.
In many universities, there is the group of questions for exams, and senior teachers of related specialties arrange the papers, and the paper inspection work is participated by all the teachers of related subjects; in this way, it solves the problem of repetitive questions to certain extent.
In order to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with practical conditions of teaching and learning, it is necessary to set questions with normal distribution in difficult degree according to general learning conditions of students, analyze learning degree of students, to lay emphasis on both basic knowledge inspection and ability inspection; at the same time, it is necessary to conduct creative design on question types.
College exam is the wand of college education, and students prepare for college exam according to the exam types; for this reason, college exam will give rise to influences on effect of college education for a long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University pays special attention to the letter from the students, and has deployed the scheme for rectification in the whole university.
Various teaching units are required to organize teachers to develop discussion and self-inspection on class ending exam, and formulate systems about question setting for exam paper, and strengthen supervision and inspection on question setting and audit, and detail grade evaluation, and strengthen comprehensive check on various teaching links.
It is a inevitable topic for college exam to solve problems such as single question types and repetitive questions from the perspective of mechanism; it is necessary to release corresponding systems; in addition, teachers are required to master teaching conditions in a comprehensive way by mastering both the teaching contents and the learning conditions of students; it is necessary to connect between teaching and learning, to form benign interaction and make exam in accordance with practical conditions, so as to make “super scholars” and “study slackers” have their proper places.
