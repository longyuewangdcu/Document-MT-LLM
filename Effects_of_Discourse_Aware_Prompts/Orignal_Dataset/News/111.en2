Thought on Education: How do examinations in college allow straight A students and slack students both get what they deserve - Xinhuanet
Three students in Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to leaders of the university to reflect their confusion on examinations in university, and raised the ideas to increase the difficulty of examinations, change types of questions and let the examinations reflect the real learning level of students.
Indeed, examinations in universities have been a “heated topic“ for a long time.
Students on campus come from all corners of the country, with varied abilities and levels; due to different efforts spent in study, their situations of study vary significantly.
It is inevitable for different feelings about the examinations to exist in such a diversified group.
Certainly, it will cause a completely different experience if there are few types of questions, the questions are repetitive or too simple.
Students who do not study hard can pass the exam after cramming before the exam; if they think of other ways, they may half the work with double results.
As such, there will be a “strange phenomenon where “slack students” who don’t ordinarily study pass the exam and even getting high scores; “straight A” students who never miss any class, take notes, do assignments get scores that are not much higher.
In this way, the problems in college exams reflected by students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not groundless; it is believed that such situations do not exist only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should applaud for the three students who wrote the letter to reflect the problem directly.
In fact, people who have been to colleges know that the phenomena of cramming for an exam, “trying to winkle” exam questions from teachers, trying to get the scope of the questions and acquiring “key tutoring” before exam are not rare; further, bringing notes to exams or begging teachers to give higher marks after exams are not rare, either.
In the view of the author, as a guidance for teaching quality evaluation, judging if the exams in a college are qualified or not relies more on the comprehensive mastering on teaching and learning by teachers, as well as the setting questions scientifically on this basis.
Majors are segmented after entering the undergraduate study, and many specialized courses are carried out with basic knowledge as the main content.
Undoubtedly, whether the students have mastered the basic knowledge is a content to be inspected in the exams in college.
Knowledge during the undergraduate study is mainly basic theories and common sense of the subject, and in terms of knowledge points, they are basically unchanged and there is not much room for variation.
As some teachers have said, “the mathematical basic knowledge in college twenty years ago is still being taught today and it is still a key content.”
However, the unchanging basic knowledge points do not mean there can be single type or repetitive questions.
There will usually be a group working on setting test questions for the exams, and senior teachers of the subject will coordinate and compile a test paper; marking test papers will be undertaken by all teachers of the subject; this can in a sense overcome the situation of repetitive questions.
In order to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with practical conditions of teaching and learning, it is necessary to set questions with normal distribution in difficulty degree according to general learning conditions of students; it is also required to learn about the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze how well the students have learned so as to have a good command of the level of difficulty and type of question in designing the test paper, giving priority to inspection of basic knowledge, and testing their ability at the same time; creative designs on the type of question can be made as well.
College exam is the baton of college education, and students prepare for college exam according to the exam types; for this reason, college exams will influence the effect of college education in the long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University pays special attention to the letter of advise from the students; it has deployed the scheme for rectification in the university.
It requires all teaching units to organize teachers to deliberate and conduct self-inspection on exams at the end of a course, formulate systems about question setting for exam paper, strengthen supervision and inspection on question setting and review, specify grade evaluation work, and strengthen comprehensive inspection on various links of course teaching.
Solving problems such as types of questions are few and repetitive questions by way of changing the system is a task that college exam administration needs to deal with; regulations need to be issued, but efforts should be made in normal times; it requires teachers to comprehensive master the teaching and learning situation; they need to not only master their teaching content but also the learning situation of the students; mastering both can better connect teaching and learning, forming an effective interaction; exams will be more fit for the actual situation, and straight A students and slack students can both get what they deserve.
