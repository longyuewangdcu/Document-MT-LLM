3200 new infants in Sabah have no birth certificates because of the supply shortage of the specially made security paper.
(Kota Kinabalu News on the 11th) According to the National Registration Bureau of Sabah, new infants cannot be provided with birth certificates from the beginning of October due to supply shortage of the specially made security paper; a total of 3,200 infants have been influenced so far.
However, director of the bureau, Kerouaminus, promised that the data of all the infants applying for birth certificate has been recorded in the system, and the certificates will be issued as soon as the security paper arrives next week.
He made the explanation at the press conference regarding to an online media’s report that the paper shortage of birth certificates in Sabah has been going on for ten months.
He said that related problems started 2 months ago, and that Sarawak is also facing this problem.
“One of the reasons is that the manufacturers of the security paper in China are influenced by the epidemic, leading to a delay in delivery to our country.”
He explained that the security paper used for birth certificates in Sabah is different from that of other regions, and therefore stock in other regions cannot be borrowed.
Kerouaminus disclosed that the latest batch of security paper has been delivered to Kuala Lumpur on December 6, and was handed over to the printing company on December 8 for part of the printing work.
“The National Registration Bureau of Sabah will dispatch staffs to pick up the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to complete the printing of the last stage after returning to Sabah, and it is estimated that they can be given out to the applicants at most 2 working days later (December 20).”
“We’ll notify the applicants to get the birth certificates at their local branch bureau.”
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
