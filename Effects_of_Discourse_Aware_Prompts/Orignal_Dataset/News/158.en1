Don’t intimidate people at the starting line – Xinhuanet
We can feel the popularity of books of success science when we go to bookstores.
Most of the books of success science today advocate “the best principle”; i.e., it is firstly assumed or implied that you can “do it”, and then tell you “what is” the thing you need to do.
As much as to say, the most important and the most fundamental link of “how to do it” is passed.
For this reason, these books have the same characteristic: either doing the best or doing nothing; either 100 or 0; either climbing on the Mount Tai or keeping standing still.
All people will regard the “best principle” “really correct”; however, 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path that “you need to make the resolution to totally change yourself”, which is just the critical weakness of many people.
If you shout “you need to change” loudly to people who stick to conventions and refuse changes, it is deceiving yourself as well as others and casting pearls before swine.
Most people display their ignorance before the word “change”, and difficult to make the resolution; or they may make the resolution of “change” because of momentary impulse, and take the first step; however, good times don’t last long, and it is very difficult for them to insist on it.
From Tomorrow on, the cross talk of Mr. Ma Sanli, expresses the “common humanity” in the most vivid way.
The biggest problem of the “best principle” is the very high starting difficulty, which exceeds the limit of ability of ordinary people, making most people “bemoaning inadequacy in the face of a great task”.
Maybe the “second best principle” is the way that makes more ordinary people step to success.
The core of the “second best principle” is on “lowering down the threshold”; it advocates to the theory of “accumulating small progresses to make large ones”; i.e., people who cannot achieve 100 can achieve at least 1, because 1 is always larger than 0; if people cannot climb on Mount Tai, they can also climb on the small sand dune around home, because it is better than marching on the spot.
In general, it’s better than doing nothing as long as you do something.
The possibility of insisting for ordinary people is greatly increased due to great drop in the starting difficulty, and the success possibility is increased as long as people can insist on it.
The journey to success by observing the “second best principle” is a little longer.
In general, although the “best principle” advocates to make all people success, it can encourage only a small part of people; however, the “second best principle” can encourage more people, to try to make more people gain benefit.
