According to lots of doctors and medical experts in South Africa, most of the patients infected by Omicron are milder cases, although it has faster transmission speed.
According to report from the Associated Press, with the transmission of Omicron in South Africa, as reported by a physician organization composed by more than 5000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa, most of the current patients of COVID-19 in treatment have mild symptoms, those similar with flu such as body ache and cough.
According to Doctor Unben Pillay, chief inspector of the organizations, he needs to provide medical services to dozens of patients every day, but none of them needs to be hospitalized.
Pillay said: “Their disease can be controlled at home, and most of them can recover after isolation of 10 to 14 days. ”
He said that aged patients or those with health problems were included, who were easier to be caught in severe cases due to infection of the corona virus.
He said, with a comparison, the patients of COVID-19 of the last round of epidemic suffered from “breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen.
Many of them should be hospitalized within only a few days”.
Other doctors shared similar experience within 2 weeks after the first report of the Omicron new variant in South Africa.

By quoting the data from National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa and other reports, Willem Hanekom, director of Africa Institute of Health said: “At present, almost all the traces indicate that this is a relatively mild disease. ”
He also said: “However, it’s the early stage, and we need acquire data of later stage.
In general conditions, hospitalization and death happen later, and it’s just two weeks since we entered into this round of epidemic. ”
At the same time, scientists all over the whole world are observing the number of medical cases and the rate of hospitalization, as well as the effect of the current vaccine and the therapeutic method at present.
Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 viral strain all over the whole world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, in which South Africa is the center of the epidemic.
