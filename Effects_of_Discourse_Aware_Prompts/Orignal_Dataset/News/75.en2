Vietnamese People’s Daily Website - Gulf Cooperation Council tackle common challenges
The locations where Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Arabia’s prince stayed include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It’s worth noting that it was the first time for Mohammed to visit Qatar since Saudi Arabia and the Arabian alliances imposed an embargo on Qatar in the middle of the year 2017 and led to the Gulf Diplomatic Crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed the diplomatic relations with Qatar and implemented a full embargo; they blamed Qatar for supporting terrorist organizations and keeping close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions had a serious impact on the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, exerting a negative influence on economy of the countries and regions in that region.
The four Arabian countries blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only solved at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January, 2021, when the gulf countries signed an agreement for “unity and stabilization” with the mediation by the U.S. and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its boundary with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in recovering the relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
Arab countries in the gulf aimed to resolve divergence; and restoring relations with Qatar originates from the need to unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, so as to cope with common challenges.
During the period when the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia visited Oman, both parties agreed to open the first direct land road passage between the two neighboring countries in the gulf.
A passage of 725km connecting the two countries will provide convenience for the travel of citizens and integration of the supply chain of the two countries.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest 5 billion USD in Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding of cooperation worth 30 billion USD.
The travel of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to gulf countries happened as the negotiation was ongoing between Iran and major countries about saving a nuclear deal named Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement condemned by the Arab Gulf countries as it’s believed it cannot solve the missile issue with Iran.
All gulf countries have always regarded Iran as the long-term “competitor” and regarded the nuclear program of Iran as a “threat” to regional security.
According to the gulf countries, it is defective not to solve the problem of the guided missiles of Iran or not to take actions to curb the activities of Iran in this region.
Under the backdrop where the nuclear negotiation between major countries and Iran was not able to meet the demand of the gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted a direct negotiation.
The objective was to restrain the upgrading of the tense situations in this region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council to be held soon will be the first summit for countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council since the end of the dispute between some member countries and Qatar.
This is the opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council; at the same time, various measures are being proposed to make the member countries cooperate sufficiently, so as to cope with common challenges and make contributions to stabilization and development of the gulf countries.
