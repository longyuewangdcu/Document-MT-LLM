Let university spirit resonate with spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
University spirit refers to a series of educational philosophy and pursuit of values an university accumulates in its long-term development; it is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, university spirit is indispensable in the development of politics, economy, culture, technology and society, as well as in the progress of a nation.
Since the establishment of the first real university in the world, universities shoulder unique missions which are different from other social organizations; universities in our country emerged in times of national crisis; its spirit is heavily influenced by traditional culture and the change of times; it advocates the values of “benefiting the world with virtue, and governing the country with integrity” and the patriotic responsibility of “building a strong country by studying”.
At present, with the increasingly prominent trend of informatization and globalization of higher education, competition of education, science and technology, and talent across the world are continuously fiercer; higher education is an important “supply end”, and the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially, the issuing of the General Plan for Coordinating and Promoting the Construction of the Global Top Universities and the Top Disciplines showcases the confidence and determination of our country in the transformation from a giant of higher education to a strong country of higher education; at the same time, it also puts forward higher and newer demands on development of universities.
How to ascend to the top in the world within a short time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines while there is still a gap, and “overtake on a bend”?
In addition to insisting on objective confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities and colleges shall also give full play to three advantages: the first one is the advantage of backwardness; through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, significantly improve the academic level and school running quality; the second one is the cultural advantage; inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization accumulated for five thousand years and carrying forward excellent traditional culture, unify strength, build brand and improve image; the third one is system advantage; give play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen objective driving, collect consensus and joining forces, optimize resource configuration, and provide sustainable and solid support for the university to speed up catching up with and surpassing the world advanced level.
It shall be especially noted that in order to construct world-class universities, the universities shall manifest their uniqueness and their own characteristics at the same time of giving full play to its advantages.
Running an university has to possess the common Chinese characteristics and manifest unique objective positioning, school operation traditions and resource endowment.
For Zhejiang University, three characteristics are emphasized in our operation: the first one is to highlight the special training of innovation and entrepreneurship talents: construct integrated teaching environment by combining science with education and combining schools and enterprises, and the full-chain entrepreneurship education ecological system; the second one is to highlight the feature of cross-discipline convergence: promote the optimization and adjustment of discipline system, build the environment of the cross-discipline system, and actively cultivate results of cross-discipline and emerging discipline research and landmark cross-discipline achievements; the third one is to highlight the school operation system and the social service features: carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate forming the industry-university research cooperation system of Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is especially important to always stick to the university spirit, and let it resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the university motto of “seeking truth and making innovation”, the common values of “study diligently, cultivate morality, foster discernment, advocate honesty” and the principles of “harboring generosity like the ocean, seeking the truth while upholding morality, being brave enough to keep exploring, and building our country” constitute the newest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
The university insists on the correct direction of running an university, continuously accumulates the altitude of culture and the important support by condensing the power of spirit; it has profound connotations and far-reaching significance.
In which, “harboring generosity like the ocean” emphasizes the spirit of inclusiveness, reflecting the mindset of “inviting all talents”, which is manifested as absorbing the premium concepts of university operation and talent training of world famous universities; “seeking the truth while upholding morality” lays emphasis on the spirit of the pursuit for truth and kindheartedness, meaning that universities shall accept the cultivation of virtue and the tempering of personality while pursuing for truth; “being brave enough to keep exploring” reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, including innovation in knowledge and science and technology, as well as reform, development and innovation; “building our country”stresses the spirit of patriotism and dedication, meaning that universities shall always share the glory and disgrace with the destiny of the country.
These spiritual ethos and the pursuit of values are the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of university running.
“Wise people can hear when there is only silence and see before things are formed.”
Universities and colleges in China shall further master the direction of the times and the historical mission of higher education based on the overall situation of the socialism with Chinese characteristics, and accelerate the construction of top universities in the world.
At the same time, hold fast to humanistic care, independence and freedom, to make university spirit, spirit of the times and national spirit promote each other, so as to provide infinite power for realizing state prosperity, national rejuvenation and the common ideal of all human beings.
