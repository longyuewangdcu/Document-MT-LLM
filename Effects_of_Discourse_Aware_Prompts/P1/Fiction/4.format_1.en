"Yan Rusheng gave her a disdainful look and said, 'Wen Xuxu, you are being vain.'"
"Don't I look good?"
"Wen Xuxu frowned and pouted, pretending to be angry."
"Yan Rusheng hesitated for a moment, then laughed, using the hand that was supporting Wen Xuxu's upper body to pinch her chest hard."
"He lowered his head and glared at her, gritting his teeth, '...sly foolish woman.'"
"He quickened his pace, walked to the side of the bed, and without any mercy, threw Wen Xuxu onto the bed. Then, he undid his shirt buttons one by one."
"He undid his belt, took off all his restraints, and then climbed into bed, pressing down on Wen Xuxu."
"It was simple and rough, not romantic at all."
"His deep black eyes met hers, and Wen Xuxu's heartbeat accelerated uncontrollably."
"Yes, after being together for so many years, every time she looked at him like this, she still felt like a deer running wild, ashamed and embarrassed."
"Perhaps it's because they are too familiar, she always feels embarrassed."
"That's why people say that it's hard to deal with familiar people, and rabbits don't eat the grass by their burrow, it's really true."
"Watching Wen Xuxu's face turn red and shy, Yan Rusheng was both excited and frustrated. The excitement was an automatic hormone response in his body, while the frustration was in his heart."
"Although he liked to see her shy expression, he didn't like her acting so reserved and demure because of her shyness, always so reserved and not proactive."
"What else do you want to hear? I already told you, look at me."
Yán rú shēng holds Xū Xū's face with both hands, forcing her to look at him.
"Xu Xu's face turned even redder, she pouted her lips, her gaze shifting, 'So, you quickly tell me, did you steal someone else's love letter to me?'"
"Uh..."
"Yanru Sheng was thinking while speaking, 'Besides the love letter from Zhao Zheng, the chocolate from Jiang Zhuohong and the movie tickets, there is also the Rainbow Lollipops from Hau Bang, the son of Chief Hau from the Public Security Bureau who is from the class above us.'"
"Hearing that, Xuxu was very surprised, 'What? Hou Bang?'"
"That so-called 'praised by thousands' science ace?"
The reason he is called "thousands of people praise" is because of his name, not because thousands of people actually praise him. Whenever his name is shouted, it's a praise of how great he is.
"At that time, when she heard this name, she knew there was someone in the school with this name, and she felt negative about it."
"But isn't that guy just a bookworm? How could he be sending her things?"
"Yeah, the name is really vulgar, and the person who named him is even more vulgar."
"Yán Rú shēng had a disdainful expression and said, 'Thankfully I ate that rainbow lollipop for you, the colorful appearance was just dyed with food coloring. At that time, my tongue and lips were all different colors. It was junk food, cheap goods.'"
Xuxu："..."
By his words, does she have to thank him for eating the things others gave her on her behalf?
She felt both angry and amused, she couldn't help it and poked Yan Ru-Sheng's forehead hard with her finger, "Yan Ru-Sheng, why don't you go to heaven?"
He really got a bargain and acted cheeky. He loved doing things like this.
After speaking, she looked at him and asked with a chuckle, "So you didn't like Director Hao because he was good?"
Although it was a question, the tone was firm.
"..." The words were weak and the mouth was silent, which could be taken as default.
She gazed at him, then stumbled into his deep, black eyes. She let out an "uh" sound and awkwardly looked away.
Then she asked, "How did you start all of these? Why didn't I know?
She pouted, as if she was chatting for the sake of chatting because she had nothing to say.
