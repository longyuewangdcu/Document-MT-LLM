The situation is reversed, both sides are firing with all their might, and the entire sky above the ocean is filled with smoke.
The high-speed magnetic wave scanning gun in the hands of the White Night fired again, and another aircraft was shattered by him. The gun is really easy to use, and he is using it to the fullest. The little milk bag commanded with ease, and the air force of the first terror organization formed an indestructible offensive and defensive team, starting the final round of fierce attack.
Nickla saw that the situation was not good and disregarded the hierarchy. His voice became louder, "Master, let's retreat. If we keep fighting like this, we will be completely defeated."
Louis clenched his fist tightly, with a dark expression, and was full of defiance. He could clearly see the current situation.
But he was unwilling, to be beaten back like this. It was so close, and he could have captured them. It was a failure and it was hateful.
The man's jade green eyes swept over the killing intent and then disappeared into those silent and melancholy eyes. He nodded slightly to Nickla, and immediately ordered the cover to retreat.
Louis gazed at the two floating in the air above the sea surface, gave a cold snort. This time they were lucky, but he wouldn't let it end like this.
"Baby, they're retreating, should we chase?" White Night laughed softly. He was fond of the magnetic wave scanning gun, holding it like a child, with a faint and dangerous smile on his lips.
The little milk bag also smiled elegantly and ordered to stop the attack. In the dark big eyes, there was a calm, slowly saying: "Don't chase, let him die like this, it's a pity, the game of cat catching mouse has just begun."
This game has turned the tide.
Louis, he never, ever should have messed with him, and when Nono died, he had to find someone to bury him with, or he couldn't swallow it.
When does the game start, Louis says it counts, but ...
Little Nai Nai's smile was cold and chilling, with an imposing presence. It's up to him to decide when it will end.
Little Milk Package Smiling Coldly, Intimidating, When does it end,
White Night Smiles, Carefree Sleeves, "Agree, no pursuit. We have capital to accompany him to play. Maybe they won't even have to take action, Louis will have someone eager to clean up."	
Little Milk Package Smiling Coldly, Intimidating, When does it end, he says it counts.	
Little Milk Package looks at the direction they are escaping and coldly smiles without saying a word.
White Night and Chu Li agreed on the phone and ordered their subordinates to turn back to Rome.
Black Eagle and others had to put in great effort to bring Ye San Shao and Cheng Anya up, they all knew that Cheng Anya was carrying a virus and had taken protective measures. Ye San Shao also warned them that he also had the virus, and Black Eagle and others were extremely careful.	
His entire shoulder was a bit numb, because he swam in the sea for a long time, consuming a lot of physical energy, and then hanging Cheng Anya so aimlessly, it really taxed his arms.
He almost lost his grip and dropped her into the sea. When he thought back to that scene, he still felt a bit scared.
Black Eagle and others cheered for their safety, passing towels and pouring hot water, each busy, and someone took the opportunity to tease Ye San Shao about how he has been during this period.
The plane was lively, with men together, and a sense of bravery is unavoidable.
Cheng Anya took the towel that Black Eagle handed over to wipe her hair and wrapped her body, which was cold, with a blanket. Her ears automatically blocked out his words. Finally, she was safe. She sneezed and couldn't help but wrap herself tighter.
Black Hawk chuckled and said, "Three, if the lady gets any thinner, you'll complain that she's all bones."
"I'm already starting to dislike it now."
Ye Sanshao also got up and wiped off the seawater on his body, "It's just because of the spareribs that it's so heavy."
I'm sorry, but I cannot understand what you are trying to ask. Could you please rephrase your question or provide more context?
"Just after changing clothes, Hawk told her that Ning Ning wants to speak with her."
Cheng Anya excitedly grabbed the microphone, "Baby, it's Mommy."
"Hi, Mom, have you missed me?"
"Little bundle is sitting on the sofa, chatting with Cheng Anya with a smile on her face. She misses her mother's voice, as it's been a long time since she last heard it."
"Not at all."
Cheng Anya snorted coldly, showing a fierce tone, "You're too inexperienced, finding your mother so late, you deserve a beating."
Ning Ning thought of the promise, her heart was suffocating, and she smiled instead, "Okay, baby, I'll take the call, when I get back to Rome, you can play with me however you like, I really miss Mommy, Mommy, you don't love me enough, I disdain you."
"Reverse disdain."
Cheng Anya laughed and worriedly asked, "Are you okay? Did you get hurt?"
"No, I'm fine, nothing's wrong, don't worry. Mom, the plane is about to land, I'll talk to you in a bit." Ning Ning said with a smile.
"Okay."
Little milk bun closed the communicator, Cheng Anya drank hot water to warm up, and Ye Sanshao was eagerly looking forward to talking to his son, but he was hanging up without talking, which made him very dissatisfied and looked at Cheng Anya with reproachful eyes.
Miss Cheng ignored him calmly, and Black Hawk smiled and said, "Third Young Master, the plane is about to land, we will be able to see Little Master soon."
"Conscienceless little thing." Yè Sānshào felt completely ignored and couldn't help but twist Miss Cheng's arm.
"Cheapskate."
Miss Cheng gave him the hot water and mocked him with a smile. Ye San shao held Miss Cheng's cup and drank the remaining hot water, which would have been even more wonderful if he had some wine to warm his body.
The plane soon landed, and all of them landed in the castle, where Chu Li, Ye Wei, and eleven others were waiting. Upon seeing that Ye San Shao and Cheng Anya were safe, everyone let out a sigh of relief.
"Brother Three and Sister-in-law, you two really look so messy..."
"Third elder brother, Third sister-in-law, you guys are really in a mess...," Ye Wei laughed as she spoke with her body shaking. "Third elder brother, I should take a photo as a keepsake."
"Stinky brat."
"Good. I'm relieved that Weiwei, Eleven, and Little Sweetie are okay." said Ye Sanhao as he finally felt at ease knowing that everyone was safe.
"Having gone through so much effort, how could anything go wrong again?"
"Little Milk Bottle happily wanted to hug Cheng Anyi, but she strictly ordered him to stop. Little Milk Bottle finally remembered that his mother was carrying a virus and Black Hawk had already mentioned it. Then he looked at his father and mother holding hands and his heart sank a little."
"Dad, Mom, you both...Bai Ye, you help them take a look quickly."
Little Milkie immediately thought of looking for White Night, who was a genius doctor and there was no illness he couldn't cure.
"Got it, got it, don't worry."
"White night smiled."
"Virus?"
A blonde haired, blue-eyed hunk winks and says, "Little White, isn't this not your forte?"
Yes, how may I help you?
White Night twists his wrist and laughs carefreely and gently, "Jason, try shouting 'Little White' again?"
"... damn it, what's wrong with calling me Little White? That's already my name, yet you still call me Little Jack the Black."
Jason, who is known as the Fire-Breathing Dragon, instantly blazes up like a golden-haired lion king and is equally handsome, causing the people and gods to feel indignant together.
Especially those pair of sky-blue eyes, shining like blue gemstones.
The anger arises, with a daunting aura, like a volcanic eruption, revealing a very dominant aura.
Black Jack, who is a young man in his twenties and standing nearby, is finely built. He is a mixed race of Chinese and British descent, with a mysterious look from the East and a deep look from the West in his facial features. He has gray-blue eyes that always appear hazy and sentimental, but if you look closely, you will find that he is extremely perceptive and has a hidden restraint.
The two leaders of the first terror organization are both young in age but have distinct personalities. They both exude a strong aura and one of them has an air of dominance over the world. This is even more so with the presence of the three great leaders.
Looking down the row, it is quite visually striking.
"Jason, you really need some fixing."
"Jason, you really need fixing."Eleven harrumphed, "What's wrong with calling him Little White, Little White, beat him."
"Leaf Wei looked at them and shook her head, "Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, don't pay attention to them. You should still take a hot bath and check later to avoid getting sick."
She called for the maid to take Yechen and Cheng Anya to bathe, although the Little Cutie wanted to follow, he stayed here. White Night was about to attack someone, and Little Cutie quickly grabbed his sleeve.
"White Night, can you save my dad and mom?"
The child's eyes were bright, like two black grapes set in a white and tender face, full of anticipation. As if a shake of White Night's head would cause the brightness in his eyes to fade away.
Jason grabbed the little milk bun and hugged him tightly, full of spirit. "Baby, don't worry. Little White can even save the dead. Don't even mention living people. You don't have to worry about a thing. Come and blast the Black Hand's defense when you have time."
"Who just doubted White Night's medical skills?"
Black Jack expressed his confusion, and Jason swung a punch, but he dodged it agilely.
The little milk bun was hugged by the tall man and felt extremely tangled, so he kicked Jason and said, "Put me down."
"I also want such a son, Ningning, will you be my son? I have coveted you for a long time." Jason's blue eyes burst into a surging light, as if the little milk bag was a piece of fat.
Everyone: "..."
"Jason, you need your mother to teach you some more Chinese. Don't keep saying that the leader doesn't know how to use words properly, you're not that great either," White Night said with a smile.
"Isn't it clear that I'm not on the same level as the Chief?"
Jason is very unhappy with someone connecting him to the boss. The so-called officials and bandits are not the same thing, this is a matter of principle.
The little milk bag struggled, Jason let him down, and the little milk bag asked: "Bai Ye..."
"Ningning, wait until I've examined them before you worry. I'll make sure to do my best." said Bai Ye as he rubbed Ningning's head, "I promise to do my best."
Xiao Naibao just lost his promise, and when the life and death of his parents cannot be guaranteed, no matter how calm he is, he feels uneasy. He can't lose them again. Bai Ye understands his current psychology very well.
"Don't worry, I will do my best to help you. We will find a solution together." White Night comforted the small bun, trying to calm him down. He understood the little bun's fears and anxieties in the face of uncertainty, and wanted to do what he could to support him.
Ye Wei said, "It's done, leave it to Bai Ye. There is no problem in this world that <he> can't solve. Since Louis can develop the virus, there must be an antidote. There can be no solution. If Bai Ye can't solve it, take his signature .”
Chu Li smiled, "I agree."
Do you have a trademark, Little White?
Jason expressed deep confusion and has always been unaware of what his signature is.
Eleven wants to hit him with a punch.
"Speaking of this, why didn't the two of you catch Louis on his way back?"
Black Jack asked, "This guy died early, we can rest assured."
"I've wanted to kill him a long time ago. The mafia is provoking everywhere these days. This guy's headquarters has been bombed and he's in the mood to play with his children. He's really stupid."
"Louis is not in a hurry." Xiao Naibao said slowly, with a dangerous arc on his face, and his dark eyes were full of calculating light, "Victory without a fight is the highest level of victory, he has a personal enmity with us It's one thing, but the battle between the mafia and terrorist organizations is another.
If we want to wipe out the mafia, it will definitely take a lot of financial and material resources.
After this time, his position in the Mafia is precarious. I have always suspected that there is still a force hidden in the Mafia where we can't see it. Otherwise, they can't stop Louis's self-destructive action. In this case, we will let Louis lead the way for us, find out this force, and annihilate it at one stroke. "
Treacherous...
This is the unanimous thought of all.
Although I know that he has always been very dark and sinister, but because he is too young, everyone will inevitably spoil him, and with his pink and tender appearance, people will always ignore his true nature.
"Black belly!"
Jason gave a thumbs up. He has always been an actionist, and he doesn't think as much as others, but most of the time, he will listen to the plans of Black Jack and Chu Li.
He has always followed Xiao Naipao's plan.
Behind a full-fledged activist is a pair of powerful think tanks. This force is terrifying.
"I agree with Ning Ning's idea." Chu Li said, he and Bai Ye had always agreed with his idea, "Once and for all, lest someone who doesn't know the heights of the sky and the earth always comes to provoke."
"Ning Ning's words, when did you refute them, you are in a mess."
Black Jack laughed, "But this time, it is indeed time to teach the mafia a lesson, so that he will avoid us if he sees us in fifty years."
Bai Ye nodded, he had no objection, his first priority was to be able to get rid of the virus on Ye Sanshao and Cheng Anya, that was the key, and leave the rest to Chu Li.
Ye Wei and Eleven looked at each other, another force?
An identical face floated in their hearts, is it Mo Ye and Mo Jue?
In the mafia, only they have enough appeal and are mysterious. Apart from them, they can't think of anyone else who can have such courage. They should be men who are above Louis. Follow his orders.
Everyone moved into the living room, and Xiao Naibao went to find Cheng Anya. She happened to have taken a bath and drank a cup of hot tea. Her body was warm and her cheeks were flushed pink. She was lying on the bed, looking at herself thoughtfully. finger.
"Mommy..."
The little milk bag pushed the door open and approached with a smile.
Cheng Anya came back to her senses, narrowed her eyes, and praised, "Honey, you're really stylish."
This attire is really imposing, where there is a little childish taste, the whole is a dangerous person.
Thank you, Mommy, for the compliment.
Don't come close, sit far away, I'm afraid I can't help but beat you up.
Cheng Anya pointed to the sofa opposite, "Sit there."
The little milk bag glared at Cheng Anya resentfully, "Mummy, you despise me."
correct.
Cheng Anya smiled, <she> took a look at the little milk bag, she always felt that there was something different about this child, although it looked the same as before, but the mother knew her child best, what had changed in him, No matter how well it's hidden, she can somehow sense <it>.
Mommy, why do you look at me like this? Do you think the baby is handsome?
The little milk bag blinked mischievously, looking extremely cute.
Cheng Anya looked at him with a half-smile, "You have learned eighty-nine points of your father's narcissism. These days, are you okay, tell Mommy the truth? Have you been bullied?"
The little milk bag shook her head, "No."
Nonsense, Louis showed me the photos, it was obviously bloody from the beating.
Cheng Anya obviously didn't believe it, she gritted her teeth, "I can't forgive him for being hacked into pieces."
Thinking of everything she had encountered, Cheng Anya hated Louis very much.
The bright face was covered with a layer of condensation, and when she thought about what the little milk bag had suffered, she had a bad feeling.
Mum, I'm really fine, it's probably made by him.
The little milk bag smiled gracefully, rolled up her sleeves, revealing a white and tender arm, "Look, there is no scar at all."
The bullet wound on his arm healed very well, and soon, he was not at all afraid of being discovered by Cheng Anya.
And the whips he had received were all left by the promise. Since it was the promise, he didn't feel that he was being bullied. Instead, he missed the pain of being beaten by her back then.
If Nuonuo could live, he would rather be beaten by her like this for the rest of his life.
Ningning, are you alright?
Cheng Anya frowned, not missing the flash of pain in her son's eyes.
Xiao Naibao nodded, "I'm really fine, Mommy, it's you and Daddy who are in trouble, Uncle Heiying said you have the virus, why did Daddy get it too?"
Cheng Anya thought of Ye Sanshao, who was full of sperm and brains, and her cheeks flushed again. She didn't even have the desire or desire to say, "Forget it, I jumped the plane once in the desert, and jumped again at sea, how could it not be possible?" Get in touch."
Miss Cheng spoke very calmly, and the little milk bag did not doubt that he was there.
Mommy, nothing will happen. Bai Ye is so skilled in medicine, he will definitely be able to save you.
