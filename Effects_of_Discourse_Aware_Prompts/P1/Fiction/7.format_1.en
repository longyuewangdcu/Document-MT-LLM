At this time, as soon as the blue, silver and golden light burst out, the fire light dimmed for a moment, and was guided downward.
But the fire gourd was obviously not that easy to deal with. It sucked upwards forcefully, snatching away part of the flames, and then flew to one side with a "swish", rushing out of the range of the blue, silver and golden light array.
These few changes are extremely fast, which makes people feel dizzy.
It's hard to deal with! this person.
It must be taken down as soon as possible, or the enforcers will come.
The fire gourd spit downwards, and the woman reappeared, her eyes filled with evil, "What are you doing?"
Just as she was speaking, a golden light flashed under her feet, and a circle of magnificent light patterns quietly emerged, and the woman's body suddenly stiffened.
Tang Wulin's Blue Silver Grass entangled upwards, Ye Xinglan's Xingshen Sword pointed forward, and pointed at his opponent's chest. Xie Xie had already quietly arrived behind her, and Guanglong's dagger was placed on her neck.
Everything is a routine!
Is there anything better than Xu Xiaoyan's Starlight Chain against a single opponent?
The absolute establishment of the Starlight Chain is an existence against the sky!
Just when everyone breathed a sigh of relief and thought they had won the opponent, a sudden change occurred! The Star God Sword was already in front of her, and the sharpness of the Guanglong Dagger behind her had also reached her neck. When her life was threatened, the woman's eyes suddenly lit up.
A resounding phoenix cry sounded from her body, and immediately after that, a powerful and unparalleled soul power burst out from her body in an instant. As if she had been stimulated by something, circles of fiery red light shone under her clothes. They were halos, but they looked like they were inside the clothes, on the neck, shoulders, elbows, waist, knees etc. The moment these fiery red rays of light appeared, an incomparably powerful soul power burst out from the woman's body.
I don't know how many times stronger than before, the soul power rises, turning into a huge ring of fire and surging out, a layer of fine golden lines emerge on the fire gourd in the air, the fire gourd that was originally only one foot high is directly pulled up When it reached two feet, it was several times bigger.
The powerful fire elemental fluctuations erupted in an instant, and the violent impact sent Tang Wulin and the others flying out, and the flames burned their soul power like tarsal maggots.
Feng Ming became louder and brighter, the woman exuded a majestic aura, and then, pieces of dark red armor appeared quickly, covering the whole body.
On the head is a certain phoenix helmet, which covers the head, and the dark red armor extends to both sides. The graceful streamlined shape goes straight down, extending in an arc, outlining the characteristics of women, and the shoulders are covered with soft lines, covering the entire arm.
Dark red flame patterns are all over the armor, and there is a golden red phoenix pattern on the breastplate. The armor is not particularly magnificent, but when covered by this armor, the woman's aura has been raised several levels.
Tang Wulin blurted out, with a wry smile on his face.
Doukai, yes, this is Doukai! Judging from its complexity and aura fluctuations, it should be a one-word battle armor, and the rings of halos that appeared on the woman's body were tools for storing the battle armor.
The one-word battle armor can't be integrated into the body of the battle armor master yet.
But even so, this is a complete set of one-word combat armor!
It means that the strength of the woman who originally cultivated the fifth ring has been directly promoted to the seven-environment realm.
Yanfeng was very angry at this time, she was in a very good mood today, very happy. Just now, I went to the Tianling Spirit Pagoda to register, and registered myself as a one-word combat armor master.
A battle armor master is a top existence that any organization is willing to support. When signing the contract just now, the Spirit Pagoda agreed to her a series of welfare policies. She is only 27 years old this year and is the youngest battle armor in Tianling City One of the teachers, the future has a bright future.
The Spirit Pagoda has promised that in the future, it will assist her in providing a lot of resources to help her become a two-word battle armor master. Once she becomes a two-word battle armor master, she will be a real battle armor master and have a place in the entire continent.
But who would have thought that just as she happily left the Spirit Pagoda, she was besieged by this group of young guys in front of her.
And their abilities are not weak, if they don't use the battle armor, they will really hit the road just now.
She didn't know that Tang Wulin and the others had no malicious intentions. The Star God Sword and the Light Dragon Dagger made her feel the threat of death.
At this moment, Wuchangkong's voice rang in the ears of Tang Wulin and the six of them, "As long as you defeat her, this city will count as a pass for you."
The corner of Tang Wulin's mouth twitched, Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu, you also have a dark side!
This is a complete one-word combat armor master, equivalent to a strong man at the level of a seven-ring soul saint. Can we win him?
Before he could think too much, Yanfeng had already made a move. The powerful soul power rose instantly, and he pointed at Tang Wulin with his right hand, and the fire gourd above his head suddenly shot out a line of fire, and it was in front of Tang Wulin in an instant.
Things have come to this point, we can only try to spell it out, and explanations are undoubtedly useless. Looking at the eyes of others, you can tell that they have been irritated.
They don't care about this! Let's deal with it first.
Tang Wulin took a deep breath, and the three purple soul rings on his body suddenly disappeared, and a golden halo emerged. The halo bloomed, his right arm swelled, and the golden dragon scales spread. At the same time, bright star lines quickly condensed on his right hand. The battle armor gauntlet emerged.
How could he not go all out against a real battle armor master!
Double armor?
Yanfeng was also taken aback when she saw the battle armor on Tang Wulin's right hand. Impossible three words came to her mind instantly!
How old is he?
Moreover, she clearly saw that Tang Wulin's battle armor emerged directly from his body. Could it be that he is a two-word battle armor?
Although it's just a piece of Doukai, it's unimaginable to own a Doukai at this age.
When she owned the first battle armor, she was already twenty-one years old, and she was still called a genius.
After years of hard training, he finally became a real one-word combat armor master.
But how old are these little guys in front of you?
At the same time Tang Wulin started, the others also moved quickly.
Xu Lizhi had retreated far before, so needless to say, buns flew out of his hands one by one, light and delicate steamed buns, bloodthirsty bean paste buns, each with one.
With his left hand behind his back, Tang Wulin had already taken the two buns and stuffed them into his mouth without hesitation.
It must be done quickly.
Even if it's just a one-word battle armor, after collecting a complete set, it has the ability to help a soul master recover his soul power quickly.
In a protracted war with others, they have no chance at all.
With his left foot stepping hard on the ground, there was a loud "boom", Tang Wulin shot up like a copper arrow, his right arm was in front of him, the blood in his body was boiling and excited, and the breath of the Golden Dragon King surged out , his eyes turned completely golden, and the fluctuations of Qi and blood blooming in his body were full of cruel taste.
The golden dragon claw in his right hand stood in front of him, shaking the opponent's flames, and rushed forward against it.
As the captain, and even a soul master of the assault department, he must not retreat half a point now, only if he blocks the front, the partners will have a chance.
Stimulated by the bloodthirsty bean paste buns, his own soul power and qi and blood power exploded to the peak in an instant, pale golden scales appeared on the skin of his whole body, and the scales on his right hand, right arm and right chest were particularly dazzling.
He is a twin spirit?
Yanfeng was stunned.
snort!
She didn't dodge at all, the fire gourd above her head suddenly spun, and the original line of fire turned into a large spray of flames, passing over Tang Wulin's head, covering his partners, blocking the others.
She wanted to isolate Tang Wulin, and she had to deal with this little guy who was obviously the leader of the other party first.
The Golden Dragon Claw arrived in front of the opponent like lightning, and Yanfeng's right hand was also lifted up, and he clenched his palm into a fist, shaking it head-on.
Seeing that the two sides were about to collide, the dragon's voice in Tang Wulin's body suddenly became agitated, and a huge golden dragon head with a diameter of more than two feet appeared without warning, directly swallowing Yanfeng's right arm.
The golden dragon is shocking!
After eating the red jade shrimp that day, although Tang Wulin's own energy and blood could not break through the fourth seal of the Golden Dragon King, it also improved greatly, making him more proficient in controlling the golden dragon.
Yanfeng was also taken aback, she only felt a strong force coming from the front, and then, she punched, the flames seemed to be swallowed up, and the golden dragon claws grabbed her body like big pliers. right hand.
With the Golden Dragon Claw exerting force, the one-word combat armor on Yanfeng's body lit up, and all the flame patterns on it seemed to come alive, especially the fire phoenix on the chest, which actually moved and turned into a phoenix fire shadow Go straight to Tang Wulin and hit him in the chest.
