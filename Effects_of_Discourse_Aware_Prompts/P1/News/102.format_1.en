"Asian-American groups complain of discrimination in admissions at three Ivy League schools including Yale - Xinhua News."
"Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei): Over 130 Asian-American groups submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on 23rd, protesting against discrimination against Asian-American applicants in the admission process of three Ivy League schools, Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College."
"The Asian-American Education Alliance, which led the initiative to file the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day."
"The chairman of the group, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of American universities has doubled, but in these three American universities, the proportion of Asian Americans has remained at the same level."
"Many studies have shown that these universities have been "discriminating against Asian-American applicants in a systematic and long-term manner" in the so-called "holistic review" of the admission process."
"Zhao Yukong introduced that the research of scholars such as Sanders in 2014 showed that among these three universities, relative to the number of applicants, Asian Americans have the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups."
"Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have been implementing a de facto racial quota for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years."
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua reporters that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will be able to launch an investigation and, after determining the facts, take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in enrollment.
They also expect the complained universities to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans.
The three universities complained about have not responded yet.
The Asian American Educational Alliance was established in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions practices, but it was not accepted by the U.S. Department of Education on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American organizations, the education groups of Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American are also participating in this complaint.
