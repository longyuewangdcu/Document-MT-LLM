"After the conclusion of the "Democratic Summit" on Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry made a statement on Saturday (December 11th) saying that the United States holding the "Leaders' Democratic Summit" is a "way to divide people with ideology, to weaponize and instrumentalize democracy, to incite division and confrontation in the name of false democracy, and to shift internal conflicts."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation,' excessively imposed unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions,' and caused catastrophic consequences."
"Democracy" has long become a "large-scale lethal weapon" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action taken by Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held via video and leaders from 111 global countries were invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but leaders from China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the United States for its own democratic issues, saying that the United States was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of skepticism both internationally and domestically in the United States, such as criticism of the invited leaders who have authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, among others. Some people doubt the true intention of the Biden administration in organizing this summit, which is not for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly elected German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, also participated in the virtual democracy summit.
The statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday claimed that today's American-style democracy is sick, showing increasingly severe problems such as money politics, identity politics, political polarization, social division, racial conflict, and wealth differentiation, and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital foundation.
In his speech, President Biden stated, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the guardrails of democracy, drive reforms, implement transparent and accountable governance, and to better withstand the buffers and impacts of authoritarianism, and those who brazenly seek power over the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must renew it in each generation and, in my view, this is a decisive challenge of our time."
President Biden also stated that global democracy and human rights "face persistent and worrying challenges, and democracy needs warriors to defend it."
The American side has promised to launch a year-long initiative following the democracy summit, which will include a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support for independent news media.
The United States hopes that all countries will make specific, public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical democracy summit scheduled to be held by the end of 2022.
President Biden said, "Let us all make good on our commitments and report next year on the progress we have made."
