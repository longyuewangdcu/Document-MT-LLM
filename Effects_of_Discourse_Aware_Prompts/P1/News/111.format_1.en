"Educational Thoughts: How College Exams Can Benefit Both "Academic Elite" and "Underperformers" - Xinhua News."
"Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, expressing their confusion about college exams and proposing an increase in exam difficulty and a change in exam format to truly reflect the students' actual level."
"Indeed, for a long time, college exams have been a "hot topic."
"In the university campus, students come from all over the world, with varying levels of ability, and with varying levels of learning, their learning situations vary greatly."
"For a group with such diverse characteristics, assessment will inevitably result in different experiences."
"Of course, if the exam questions are monotonous, with high repetition and too simple, it will inevitably result in a completely different experience."
"Students who do not study hard may be able to pass the exam by cramming before the exam. If they use other methods, they may achieve twice the result with half the effort."
"As a result, the situation where "underperformers" can pass the exams without putting in much effort, even getting high scores, while "academic elites" who never miss class, have good homework and notes, do not score much higher in exams, becomes a strange reality."
"It seems that the reflection of the problems in college exams by the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University is not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not limited to Lanzhou Jiaotong University."
"In this sense, it is worthy of praise for these three students who wrote the letter to express their opinions."
"Actually, those who have been to university are well aware that last-minute studying, seeking various methods to get exam questions from teachers, trying to make sure that the exam covers the materials studied, and even seeking extra help before the exam, as well as cheating during the exam and asking teachers for favors after the exam, are not uncommon."
In my view, as a quality assessment of teaching, the measure of whether a university exam is pass or fail is more about the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and based on this, scientific proposition.
When entering the undergraduate stage of a university, the major begins to become more specialized, and many major courses mainly focus on basic knowledge.
Undoubtedly, whether one has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is what university exams will test.
Undoubtedly, whether comprehensive mastery of the basic knowledge points of a subject is a content that university exams are to examine. And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theories and common sense of the subject. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large and is basically fixed.
As some teachers say, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics learned 20 years ago is still being studied and is still a priority."
But the basic knowledge points remaining the same does not mean the exam questions are single or repeated.
In many universities, exams are generally composed of a question-setting group, and then coordinated by senior subject teachers to form the exam paper. The grading of the exam is also participated by all teachers who are responsible for the subject, which can to some extent overcome the repetition of test questions.
In many universities, exams are generally composed of a question-setting group, which is coordinated by senior subject teachers to form a test paper, and the exam grading is also participated by all teachers responsible for the subject, which can to some extent overcome the situation of repeated questions. But to design a set of questions that are in line with the practical teaching and learning, the difficulty of the questions should be normally distributed according to the overall learning situation of the students, and it also requires a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, a comprehensive analysis of the students' learning level, so that the examination proposition has a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and question types, which can both emphasize the examination of basic knowledge and take into account the ability assessment, and at the same time, the question types are innovatively designed.
Examinations are the guiding stick of university education, and students will have corresponding preparation plans for whatever kind of exams there are. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
The Lanzhou Jiaotong University takes the student's suggestions letter very seriously and has already deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
The English translation for the sentence is: "It is required for each teaching unit to organize teachers to carry out research and course final exams, to develop examination question papers and relevant regulations, to strengthen supervision and inspection of the question paper proposition and review process, to refine the evaluation of grades, and to strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching."
The issue of examination questions being too similar or limited in type is a matter that the university examination administration needs to address. Of course, appropriate policies need to be put in place, but the real effort should be made on a daily basis. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only understanding the teaching content, but also understanding the learning situation of students. By mastering both aspects, teaching and learning can better connect and form a positive interaction, and exams will be more in line with reality, so that both top students and struggling students can benefit.
