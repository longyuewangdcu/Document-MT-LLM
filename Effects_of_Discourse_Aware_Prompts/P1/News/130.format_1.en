"Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11th, People's Daily December 12th commentator article: '14th Five-Year Plan' has a good start-On learning and implementing the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference."
"Achieved a good start of the '14th Five-Year Plan', the Central Economic Work Conference held from December 8th to 10th highly evaluated the achievements in the economic and social development of our country over the past year."
"General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the meeting, deeply summarizing the economic work in 2021, thoroughly analyzing the current economic situation, making major deployments for the economic work in 2022, preparing us for next year's economic work, and welcoming the successful convening of the party's 20th congress, pointing out the direction forward and providing fundamental guidance."
"We grandly celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, officially announce the comprehensive building of a moderately prosperous society and the achievement of the first centenary goal, and embark on a new journey towards the second centenary goal of building a socialist modernized country."
"We held the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, summarizing the major achievements and historical experiences of the Party's hundred-year struggle, and passed the third historical resolution in the history of the Party, the Resolution of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on the Major Achievements and Historical Experiences of the Party's Hundred-Year Struggle. This is a political declaration for the new era of the Communist Party of China to always remember their original mission and purpose, adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and is a guide for action that looks to history as a mirror, creates the future, and realizes the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
"Over the past year, the world has seen a once-in-a-century great change and the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a more complex and severe external environment. The tasks of COVID-19 prevention and control and economic and social development at home are extremely heavy and arduous."
"The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has consistently coordinated domestic and international affairs, maintained a steady and forward-looking approach, calmly responded to the changes of the century and the global pandemic, balanced epidemic control and economic and social development, accelerated the construction of a new development pattern, strengthened the cross-cycle adjustment of macro policies, worked hard to promote sustainable and healthy economic development, deepened reforms, opening up, and innovation, and made new and significant achievements in various endeavors of the Party and the state."
"The 14th Five-Year Plan" has had a good start, which is reflected in the fact that building a new development pattern has taken new strides and high-quality development has achieved new results.
The English translation for the sentence is: "Our country's economic development and epidemic prevention and control maintain a leading position globally, with characteristics of strong resilience, great potential, and sufficient momentum continuing to emerge. The national strategic scientific and technological strength accelerates its growth and significant innovation results are emerging one after another, with the ability to innovate continuing to improve and new breakthroughs being made in key core technologies. The resilience of the industrial chain is being strengthened, the volume and quality of foreign trade is increasing, the structure is continuing to be optimized, and new momentum represented by new industries, new forms of business, and new models is growing stronger. Reform and opening up is being pushed forward in depth, with efforts to clear bottlenecks that restrict the matching of supply and demand and the flow of factors, and to build new advantages for cooperation and competition through high-level openness to the outside world. Livelihood security is effectively ensured, employment scale continues to expand, the growth of residents' income is basically in sync with economic growth, grain production has remained above 13 billion jin for seven consecutive years, and has achieved "18 consecutive bumper crops". The construction of ecological civilization continues to advance, the work of carbon peak and carbon neutralization is being coordinated, the pace of green low-carbon transformation is steady, and new achievements have been made in the protection of the ecological environment."
These achievements were the result of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. They are also the result of the concerted and arduous efforts of the entire Party, the entire country, and all ethnic groups.
The practical results once again demonstrate that the Communist Party has established Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the entire Party, and has established the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guiding position, which has a decisive significance for the development of the Party and the state in the new era, as well as for promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
With General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee and the entire Party, guiding the way with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and with all Party members and people of all ethnic groups united and working hard, we will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and create new era glories and forge new historical feats in the new journey of building a modern socialist country with comprehensive development.
The 20th National Congress of the Party will be held next year, which is a major event in the political life of the Party and the country.
By promoting the great spirit of founding the Party, adhering to the overall tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, thoroughly and accurately implementing the new development concept, accelerating the construction of a new development pattern, comprehensively deepening reform and opening up, insisting on innovation-driven development, promoting high-quality development, and taking supply-side structural reform as the main line, we will coordinate the prevention and control of the epidemic and the development of the economy and society, coordinate development and security, continue to do a good job of "six stability" and "six guarantees," sustainably improve people's livelihoods, work hard to stabilize the macroeconomic situation, maintain the economy within a reasonable range, and maintain social stability. We will definitely maintain a stable and healthy economic environment, a peaceful and stable society, and a clear and upright political environment, and welcome the success of the 20th Party Congress with outstanding achievements.
