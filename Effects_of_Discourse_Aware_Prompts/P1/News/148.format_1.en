"48-hour nucleic acid test negative, with 'buffer zone' the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issues a document calling for strengthened epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News."
"Xinhua News, Beijing, December 11th (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiance). The State Council joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities. It requires that personnel leaving land border ports cities (excluding those connected with Hong Kong and Macau) in the near future must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and personnel arriving at land border ports cities must undergo at least 1 nucleic acid test."
"According to the notice, the above-mentioned requirements are in effect from the date on which the port city range is determined and announced by each province, autonomous region, and municipality, to March 15, 2022."
"In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions may study the setting up of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction."
"A relevant responsible person from the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar and both sides have frequent exchanges of citizens."
"Implementing differential management policies for different regions, changing from one line of defense to two lines of defense, is expected to achieve the goal of moving the barrier forward and reducing the risk of outbreak spillover, with the minimum social impact and lowest social cost, to achieve the maximum effect in epidemic prevention and control."
"Recently, there have been multiple local clustered epidemic outbreaks in our country, which have all been imported through port cities from overseas."
The notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as inadequate and untimely epidemic monitoring and warning in some places, lack of implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, formality of regular nucleic acid testing, insufficient killing of cold chain items in each link, unstandardized management of concentrated isolation places, and insufficient scientific and precise epidemic emergency handling.
The notice requires that effort be made in nine areas including improving the mechanism for epidemic prevention and control in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to fill the gaps and weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in port cities, to do the work of epidemic prevention and control without relaxing, to scientifically and accurately do the work, and to closely strengthen the line of defense against imported epidemics.
The notice emphasized that each port city should synchronize the study and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with the work of safeguarding people's livelihood, publish and facilitate the hotlines for people's livelihood security, regularly check for hidden dangers in the supply and prices of basic living materials, and promptly solve and proactively respond to prominent issues reflected by the masses.
The notice states that the referred port cities include the counties, cities, and directly governed municipalities of open land, water, and air ports. The specific scope will be determined and announced in a timely manner by each province, autonomous region, and directly governed municipality according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control.
