"Don't scare people at the starting line" - Xinhua News Agency
"When visiting a book fair, one often feels the popularity of self-help and success books."
"Many of today's self-help and success books promote the 'best principle' -- that is, first assuming or implying that you can 'do it', and then telling you what needs to be done."
"In other words, it skips over the most important and fundamental aspect, which is 'how to do it.'"
"For this reason, these books all have one common characteristic -- either give it your all and do your best, or don't bother doing anything at all; either it's 100, or it's 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay put in your original position."
"This 'best principle' is recognized as 'perfectly correct' by anyone who sees it, but 99% of people are scared at the starting line."
"Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make a firm determination, start anew, and make a 180-degree change," which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people."
"For those who are set in their ways, follow traditions, and reject change, to shout in their ears "you have to change" is undoubtedly a futile and self-deceptive act, like playing a lute to a cow."
"Most people will be intimidated by the words "change" and be hesitant to take action, or make a firm resolution to change based on a momentary impulse and bravely take the first step, but often the good times are short-lived, unable to persist for a short time, and lacking in sustainability."
The famous cross-talk "Starting From Tomorrow" by Mr. Ma Sanli vividly demonstrates this "universal human nature" in a classic way.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "admire from a distance."
Maybe, "the second-best principle" is a way that can lead more ordinary people to a relatively successful path.
The core of "the secondary best principle" is to "lower the threshold." It encourages the theory of "accumulating small victories for a big victory." If you can't achieve 100, just achieve 1, because 1 is always greater than 0. If you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is always stronger than standing still.
The essence of it is, as long as you do something, it's always better than doing nothing.
"Due to the significant lowering of the threshold, it becomes more possible for ordinary people to stick to it, and as long as they persist, the probability of success will also increase."
The success road of following the "second-best principle" is just slightly longer.
In conclusion, although the "best principle" claims to inspire success for everyone, it ultimately only motivates a small group of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" effectively motivates more people and benefits as many as possible.
