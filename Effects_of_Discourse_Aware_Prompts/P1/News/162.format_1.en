The reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11th (reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) - According to the latest monitoring results obtained from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Qinghai Province, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 71,000 tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, a cumulative growth of more than 40 times compared to the initial stage of protection in 2002.
The naked carp in Qinghai Lake, commonly known as "Huangyu," is a precious species unique to the lake and plays a crucial role in maintaining the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain security and biological diversity in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as excessive human hunting and the degradation of the breeding environment, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "Red List of China's Species."
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of the lake for fish cultivation, and prohibited any unit, collective, or individual from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake area, and banned the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial breeding and releasing, cleaning up the main rivers entering Qinghai Lake, and designing scientifically reasonable "fish passage" channels, the protection efforts are continually increased, and the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased year by year.
The Vice Director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that, as of now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been released through artificial breeding in Qinghai Lake, and the contribution rate to the restoration of the naked carp resources in the lake is more than 23%.
The Sanjiangyuan area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological functional area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
"In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and Qinghai Lake, to protect aquatic wildlife and maintain the biodiversity of the Tibetan Plateau, Qinghai has issued ban-fishing announcements for the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake and established a comprehensive ban-fishing management system of "one river, one river, and one lake."
