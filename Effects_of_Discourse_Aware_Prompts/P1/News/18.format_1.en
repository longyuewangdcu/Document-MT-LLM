Chongqing Vocational School is piloting a modern apprenticeship system, where admission is equivalent to being a qualified employee of the enterprise - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, 60 vocational schools in our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model. Students who are accepted for pilot training will have both student and apprentice identities, and after enrollment, they will be pre-registered as unit employees by pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that vocational schools standardize their admission and employment procedures with enterprises, clarify the dual identities of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise trainees, and sign three-party agreements based on the principle of mutual selection. For apprentices who are 16 years old but not yet 18 years old, four parties (the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise) must sign an agreement to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific job position, teaching content, and rights protection for the apprentice during the on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and jointly carry out pre-employment training and job transfer training with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools need to reform their talent training model.
Schools and enterprises should jointly design talent training plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot period is defined as one training cycle. The internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the on-the-job training generally lasts for 6 months.
In the enterprise practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one mentor can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
From 2016 to August 2019, 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilot programs were determined in three batches in our city. Each pilot program has around 50 participants, and a total of around 3,000 students (apprentices) are trained.
According to the principle of first piloting and then promoting, from pilot to generalization, exploring the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training and integrated cultivation between schools and enterprises, effectively enhancing students' job skills, and improving their employment rate and quality.
