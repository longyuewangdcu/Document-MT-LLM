The organizers of the Zhongsha exhibition join hands to host the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News.
Xinhua News, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan): The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, the Dariyah Contemporary Art Biennial, officially opened to the public on the 11th at the JAX Art District in the northwest of the capital, Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places are participating in the exhibition.
This biennial is jointly planned by the Dariyah Biennial Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Tian Fei Yu, Director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, serving as Artistic Director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "Feeling One's Way Across the River," which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current state of cultural development in Saudi society.
This biennial covers nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Feeling One's Way Across the River," "Heritage as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Towards the Public," "A Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi Arabian artists account for over 40% of the total exhibits on display, encompassing a variety of forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists are also attracting attention, with some artists using recycled materials in innovative ways in their creations, such as Xu Bing in the "Story Behind Series: Endless Picture of Stream and Mountain" (2014), where she reconstructed a classic landscape painting using waste materials.
The CEO of the Dhiraa Biennial Foundation, Baraki, stated that he hopes this biennial exhibition can establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to understand the flourishing cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and enhance mutual interaction.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biennial exhibition is dual, it aims to both allow contemporary art from Saudi Arabia to participate in global dialogue, and also allow Saudi audiences to be part of the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the biennial exhibition period, in which artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.
