A relevant responsible person from Yunnan Province's Human Resources and Social Security Department introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare positions, which are used to provide employment for rural disadvantaged groups such as those who have escaped poverty, playing an important role in helping poverty-stricken populations increase their income through employment, consolidating poverty reduction achievements, and effectively improving the ability to provide various public services in rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan's Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, mainly regulating the scope of the individuals being recruited for rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level, as well as the management of funds, development of positions, and management of positions in a unified manner.
In terms of the development and setting of positions, the new regulation clearly states that the positions should be set in accordance with the principles of "setting positions based on demand, determining personnel based on positions, dynamic management, and overall quantity control," "the one who develops, the one who uses, and the one who is responsible," and "one person, one position, voluntary openness, and unified management."
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with steps including announcement, declaration, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training, and arrangement for starting work.
In addition, the new regulation also clarifies the specific responsibilities of the main departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and methods for rural public welfare positions, and stipulates that rural public welfare position development departments should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injury for those placed in rural public welfare positions; and requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the allocation of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.
