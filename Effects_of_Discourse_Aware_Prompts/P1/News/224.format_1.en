"The starry sky has an appointment | The Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its peak on the 14th - Xinhua News."
"Xinhua News, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian): Astronomy popular science experts introduce that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, the Gemini Meteor Shower, one of the three largest meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the late night of the same day."
"The Gemini Meteor Shower photographed by astronomical enthusiasts Anjiu in Qinghai on December 13th, 2018."
"Most meteor showers are caused by periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini Meteor Shower is asteroid 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid."
"The Gemini Meteor Shower is also the second known meteor shower not "fostered" by a comet."
"Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and astronomical popular science expert, introduced that just like a New Year's movie, the Gemini Meteor Shower generally appears at the end of the year, with its "showing period" lasting from December 4th to 17th."
"The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is called one of the three largest meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere along with the Geminids and the Perseids."
"A notable feature of the Gemini Meteor Shower is that the meteor speed is relatively slow, the color is rich, and there are many fireballs, which are suitable for both visual observation and for photography by beginners in astronomy."
"Yang Jing, an astronomical enthusiast in Tianjin, captured the Gemini Meteor Shower on December 13, 2020 in Jizhou, Tianjin."
"Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observing conditions with the radiant located directly overhead) of 150."
The recommended index chart for the Gemini Meteor Shower.
"Last year, the 'florid' Gemini meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be interfered by moonlight and its splendor will be discounted a bit."
The English translation for the sentence: "14th is the 11th day of the 11th month in the lunar calendar, and the phase of the moon is a full moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, but fortunately the moon will set in the late night and the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise higher."
"Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the few hours after the moon sets in the latter half of the night, but remember to protect against the cold and stay warm."
How can we observe more meteoroids as much as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a place with a high altitude, low light pollution, facing the northeast direction with a wide view in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until the moon sets and observe visually."
It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower is large in all directions, and you don't need to keep your eyes fixed on the radiant point of the Gemini meteor shower when observing.
"Photography enthusiasts who want to capture a spectacular 'meteor shower' should choose a wide-angle and large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting."
"Considering stability and continuity, a tripod, spare battery, and shutter release cable are also essential."
"Xiu Li Peng reminds."
