"The mainstream of the Yangtze River achieves full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News."
"Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11th (Reporter Wang Xian): The Fuling Water-Based Green Comprehensive Service Area in Chongqing was officially put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water-based green comprehensive service area in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to officially go into operation, following the Luzhou Water-Based Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province, which was put into operation on the 8th."
"With this, the water-based green comprehensive service areas have now covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River."
"Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration under the Ministry of Transport, introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have already built and operated ten water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been widely recognized by the majority of boatmen and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping."
"Full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, significantly improving the ability of the Yangtze River to receive ship-borne pollutants and shipping services."
"According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility that provides all-around production and living services for boats and boatmen and helps solve the "urgent and desperate" problems for the majority of boatmen."
"The two water-based green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been built and put into operation, integrate life services, production services, and government services as one, with a focus on green environmental protection and featuring ship repair and emergency rescue services. This will allow boats to "dock once and receive multiple services," making the work of boatmen who navigate the Yangtze River year-round more efficient and their lives more convenient."
