"South African doctors: Although the transmission power of Oumicrong is strong, it is mostly mild."
"Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus variant Oumicrong are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly."
"According to the Associated Press, as the Oumicrong variant spreads in South Africa, a physician organization made up of over 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reports that the symptoms they are currently treating in their COVID-19 patients are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, similar to flu-like symptoms."
"Dr. Unben Pillay, the director of the organization, says he sees several dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized yet."
"Pillay says: 'They are able to control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of quarantine.'"
"He says this includes elderly patients and those with health issues who are usually more susceptible to severe illness due to coronavirus infection."
"He says that in comparison, during the previous wave of the Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen levels."
"Many of them had to be hospitalized within a few days.'"
"Within two weeks of the first reported case of the Oumicrong variant in Southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences."
"Although it will take a few more weeks to gather enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues."
According to a summary from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in South Africa: Among the COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital in the recent weeks, only 30% are severe cases, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the outbreak; the average length of hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, while the death rate reached 20% in the early outbreak cases in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, the head of the African Health Research Institute, cites data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports saying: "Currently, almost all indications point to this being a milder illness."
He also said, "It's still early and we need to get follow-up data."
He also said, "Typically, hospitalization and deaths occur later, and we have only been into this wave of the outbreak for two weeks."
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are monitoring the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the efficacy of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Despite Deltoid remaining the main strain of the novel coronavirus globally, cases of the Omicson variant are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December in the Western Cape province increased by 400%, with tests showing that cases of the Omega variant accounted for more than 90%.
