"Intelligent surgical light: the doctor's high-energy eyes."
"In addition to smartphones, intelligent surgical lights are also used in the operating room."
This invention won a silver prize at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, Master's students from the College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, started a new thinking from the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented the intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases are not detected or removed properly in their early stages, and this is related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said that for example, during early detection of cancer, if the doctor can't see all the tumor tissues in time, then cancer cells will spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs that enhance the differentiation of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
"During surgery, the doctor can adjust the size of the light spot, the brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate according to the needs of the surgery and personal preferences."
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine and received positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Air washing: water-saving and cool.
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most they rub some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qi-zhang and his classmates have invented a set of "air hand washing device."
Just by standing on the washing platform of the device, our weight can compress the air out.
"Just like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
"So, we can wash our hands clean!"
Color-reactivity and bacterial residue experiments have proven that washing hands through this method is equally effective as conventional hand-washing methods.
This device relies solely on our own gravity as the driving force, ensuring the washing degree while saving 90% of water, and the entire process is completely energy-free and energy-saving.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-class universities and won the only gold medal.
