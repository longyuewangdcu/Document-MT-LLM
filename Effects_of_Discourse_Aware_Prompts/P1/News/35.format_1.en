"Educational Comment: What Does it Take to Rescue Abducted Children?"
"If we parallel the famous public service advertisement "No Trade, No Killing", then in a good environment where there is no demand for abduction, group prevention and collective anti-abduction, making abduction a profitable, risky, and costly act, such crimes will not keep happening."
"Recently, the Children's Missing Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has gone online."
"This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to promptly recover abducted children."
"I heard that this app is called "Reunion" and I feel a sense of warmth and comfort immediately."
"The new technological means is not only named "Artistic" and full of feelings, but also properly applied in information technology, practical, and effective."
"The primary objective of the anti-abduction enforcement is to locate the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom."
"Secondly is the trial and punishment of the suspects."
"The significance of criminal punishment can be illustrated by many "big words", ranging from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education."
"But before the trafficking case is solved, the personal safety of the victims should be the top priority."
"It is important to distinguish between what is urgent and what is not. Under the pressing goal of "rescue", controversial topics such as "whether children who have been trafficked should receive the death penalty" can be temporarily put aside and discussed cautiously, but rescuing trafficked children should not be delayed."
According to the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers are prone to leaving the scene of the crime as soon as they succeed.
"Delays in the search and rescue operation for one minute could lead to the child being further away from their parents and make it more difficult to crack the case."
In this situation, taking an effective measure such as the "Tuan Yuan" platform, which directly helps to crack the case and find the child, is indeed a practical action.
Ultimately, "Combating Kidnapping" is a big task that requires the entire legal system to be put into action.
Combating crime, protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, all require the implementation of the concern for "protecting the young and helping the weak."
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be improved from families to society.
A common case is when a family of three rests at a train station, the parents are deeply asleep, and they wake up to find the child missing.
It cannot be expected that a two-year-old child has enough self-protective skills, but as the parent of a young child, one should have at least a considerable level of protective awareness.
It is the minimum measure to prevent children from being abducted if the parents take turns to rest or place the child under safe protection.
On the other side of the fight against child trafficking by the police, the buyers of trafficked children should also be scrutinized and punished.
Individual illegal acts are often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the statutory punishment for the crime of child trafficking is a minimum of 5 years imprisonment; in particularly serious cases, the punishment may be a death sentence, with forfeiture of property.
"With the minimum sentence starting at 5 years and the possibility of the death penalty in particularly severe cases, the crime of child trafficking is obviously considered a serious offense, even amidst the trend towards lenient punishment."
Even to this day, there are still many cases of child trafficking that occur each year.
It can be seen that some people have backward views on nurturing children and weak legal awareness.
Legal education for these people should be kept up with.
"To effectively control child trafficking crimes, relying solely on strict enforcement by the authorities is not enough."
"If the market for buying abducted children continues to exist and abductors are driven by greed and constantly come up with new ways to abduct, creating a situation of confrontation with law enforcement, efforts to stop abduction will inevitably become bogged down in inefficiency."
Therefore, eliminating outdated ideas and promoting common legal knowledge will also help to eradicate the crime of kidnapping and buying children.
