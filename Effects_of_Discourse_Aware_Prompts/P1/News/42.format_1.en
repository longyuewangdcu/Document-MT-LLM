The democratic summit has ended, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out.
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by U.S. President Biden and attended by government and civic leaders from 110 countries around the world as well as private sector leaders, concluded on Friday, December 10th.
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also stated that he plans to convene the second global "Summit for Democracy" next year.
Representatives from the Taiwan government, Tang Feng and Hong Kong democratic human rights activist, Joshua Wong who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, "We know how challenging the work ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I've said before, as this summit has shown, the world of democracy is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never snuff out the small flame of freedom, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world.
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective effort of society as a whole.
He said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the safeguards of democracy, drive reforms, implement transparent accountability, resist the buffering and impacting forces of authoritarianism, and those who blatantly seek power before the public interest."
The themes of the second day of the "Summit for Democracy" were defending human rights, strengthening democracy and combating authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
The sentence "这一天恰逢“国际人权日”" can be translated to "This day coincides with 'International Human Rights Day'."
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, also said in his opening speech on that day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges posed by the emerging digital technologies.
"Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, and the resilience of democracy," he said.
"It requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls."
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democratic human rights activist Joshua Wong delivered a pre-recorded video speech to the summit, reminding attendees to continue to monitor the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong and the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable."
He said: "This is why political figures and leaders of civil society must work together."
"We must use all (resources) we have to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Lo called for the free world to unite against the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you haven't realized the threat the Communist Party poses to our democratic values."
"And this is the reason for our failure."
This is also the reason we must change.
Taiwan's Executive Yuan's Cabinet member Tang Feng delivered a statement via video at a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Upholding Democratic Values." He emphasized that Taiwan is on the front line of the fight against dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by promoting information transparency and building trust.
He said, "At a time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly on the front lines of the global fight against authoritarianism and have played a leading role in promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights worldwide."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world justified their violation of human rights in the name of public health and collective interest, leading to a global trend of democratic regression.
"However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down to control the epidemic and we don't have to take down (information) to defeat fake news."
The day after the "Democracy Summit," the US Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, that were deemed to have seriously violated human rights. At the same time, a Chinese company that was accused of using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations was also subjected to investment restrictions.
