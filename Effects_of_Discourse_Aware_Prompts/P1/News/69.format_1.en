"We discovered the situation around 10 o'clock in the morning on the 23rd during our patrol near the square, at which point there was already a large crowd of onlookers."
The police officer from the nearby Tianshui police station who received the media interview stated that there were two girls in total who were setting up a stand, both around 20 years old and dressed beautifully in a youthful way.
The police officers near the scene told local media that there were two young women, both around 20 years old and dressed attractively, who were doing the "human target" activity. One of the women was crying and begging passerby to play the game, while the other was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed money for surgery, asking for everyone's help.
"We have made contact with the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was fundraising for her sister's treatment for leukemia."
Last night, the publicity official of the Xiaocheng branch of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to a New Beijing Daily reporter that the girl is named Jijiali and was fundraising for her sister Jijia Yan.
But because the treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan, she couldn't think of a good way to raise funds, so she did this.
The process was that two girls, one serving as the target and the other responsible for shooting, but did not participate. No one was found to shoot arrows during the whole process, but only people watched and took pictures that were posted on Weibo.
The police later determined through assessment by the security department that the bow and arrow used were not subject to regulation.
The spokesperson said, "This type of attention-seeking fundraising method is not encouraged."
The police officer from the local police station warned her and she has already left the police station.
