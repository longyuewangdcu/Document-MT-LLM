"Jiexin advocates rational consumption for consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website."
"This year's "Double Eleven" festival, the national online payment transaction amount reached 177 billion yuan, creating a new high compared to previous years."
"The various reductions and bonuses, and the eye-catching live broadcasts that sell products, once again make consumers feel the benefits. On the one hand, this consumption boom makes people marvel at the increasingly strong national consumption power, on the other hand, it is necessary to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer group."
"On the eve of the arrival of "Double Twelve," Jiexin Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Jiexin") issued an advocacy for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish a good consumption awareness and habits, and to refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption."
"According to the "Consumer Finance Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer finance literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019."
"Overall, the performance of residents in China in terms of financial consumption is relatively good, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills. Further improvement in basic financial knowledge level is needed."
The financial literacy levels of the elderly and youth are relatively low. The "one old and one young" demographic will still be the focus of continuous financial education. The "Report on the Debt Situation of China's Young People" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumer Report" released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has huge consumer potential and credit consumption is an important way of upgrading consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation generally shows a trend of rational consumption, they are very different from the label of "excessive extravagance" attached to them by the outside world, but some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-the-trend consumption behavior, which has led to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even caused social problems to increase gradually. Financial companies should be brave to take on social responsibility and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been committed to helping people build their happy lives with high-quality and considerate services, advocating the establishment of a good and correct consumer outlook, and actively responding to regulatory calls, taking practical action to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people.
In the past few years, Jiexin has continuously carried out comprehensive and diverse financial literacy activities aimed at young groups, including college students, and has subtly influenced their consumption demands through various forms of cooperation with top domestic universities and innovation practice competitions. Jiexin helps them establish a rational consumption perspective, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and thus accumulate wealth for their life.
As Double Twelve approaches, Jiexin reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct financial outlook, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid consumption loan mistakes, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
Consumers must plan ahead and repay on time in proportion to their ability.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the individual credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying a car or buying a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, one should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking the relevant institutions for their operating qualifications.
In the future, Jie Xin will continue to bring consumers more tailored and diverse services with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products. It will continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, assist consumers in developing a rational consumption and moderate borrowing concept, and be a reliable consumer finance partner for consumers for life.
