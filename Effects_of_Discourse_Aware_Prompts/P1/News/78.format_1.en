"Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times- Xinhua News Agency."
"The so-called spirit of the university refers to a series of educational ideas and values that a university has accumulated in the course of its development and represents the soul of the university."
"From ancient times to the present day, the spirit of the university has been crucial for the development of politics, economics, culture, technology, society and even the progress of a nation."
"Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have been entrusted with a unique mission distinct from other social organizations. For universities in China, they emerged during a time of national crisis, and their spirit has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and historical changes. They advocate the value of "cultivating morality and benefiting society, promoting education and strengthening the nation", and they bear the responsibility of patriotism by promoting education and strengthening the country."
"At present, the trend towards digitalization and internationalization in higher education is becoming increasingly apparent, and the global competition in education, technology, and talent is intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply side," is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reforms."
"Especially with the introduction of the "Overall Plan for the Development of World-Class Universities and Disciplines," which demonstrates China's confidence and determination to move from a nation with high levels of education to a strong power in education, it places even higher and more updated demands on university development."
"How can we strive to be among the world's top ranks in a relatively short period of time and accelerate the establishment of world-class universities and disciplines, despite still having a certain gap, so as to achieve a "overtaking on a bend in the road?"
In addition to having a firm sense of purpose, confidence in the chosen path, and confidence in one's abilities, universities should also make full use of three advantages: First, the advantage of being a latecomer, by continuously attracting outstanding academic talent from overseas, learning from the advanced experiences of world-class universities, and achieving a significant improvement in academic level and quality of operations. Second, cultural advantage, by inheriting the wisdom contained in the 5000 years of accumulated Chinese civilization, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, and using this to consolidate strength, shape brand image, and enhance reputation. Third, institutional advantage, by leveraging the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven approaches, pooling consensus and collective efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for the university to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level.
Special attention should be given to the fact that building world-class universities cannot be achieved in a uniform way. Each university must highlight its own individuality and uniqueness while showcasing its strengths.
It should be noted that the development of world-class universities cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach. While each university should play to its strengths, it must also showcase its individuality and uniqueness. The school's characteristics should reflect not only the common Chinese characteristics, but also its own unique goals, traditions and resources.
As for Zhejiang University, in our education, we pay attention to highlighting three characteristics: Firstly, to emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated education environment that combines science and education with school-enterprise integration, and forming a complete chain of entrepreneurial education ecology; Secondly, to highlight the convergence of interdisciplinary subjects, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, creating a system environment for interdisciplinary subjects, and actively fostering emerging interdisciplinary subjects and signature interdisciplinary achievements; Thirdly, to highlight the education system and social service characteristics, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a Pan-Zhejiang production-learning-research cooperation system.
It is particularly important in this process to always adhere to the spirit of the university and make the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligence, Improvement, Clarity, and Practicality", and the common aspirations of "Embracing the Rivers and Seas, Cultivating Virtues, Improving the People and Nation" collectively form the latest expression of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct educational direction, constantly accumulate cultural height, and condense spiritual strength. It is rich in content and has far-reaching significance.
In this context, "海纳江河" emphasizes an open and inclusive spirit, reflecting a mindset of "the world's talents are for my use." It expresses the goal of acquiring the best practices in education from world-renowned universities. "启真厚德" emphasizes a pursuit of truth and goodness, which refers to the university's aim of not only pursuing truth, but also fostering moral and character development. "开物前民" embodies a spirit of reform and innovation, encompassing the pursuit of knowledge and research innovation, as well as reform and renewal in all aspects. "树我邦国" emphasizes a patriotic spirit of dedication, which means the university should always share the same fate as the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and values is exactly where the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education lies.
"The clever listen in silence, and the wise see in the unseen."
Chinese universities should further firmly stand in the overall context of China's socialist cause, deeply grasp the historical position and mission of higher education, and speed up the construction of becoming world-class universities.
At the same time, upholding a focus on human care and independence, allowing the spirit of the university to interact with the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation, thus providing a continuous driving force for the realization of national prosperity and rejuvenation and the common ideals of mankind.
