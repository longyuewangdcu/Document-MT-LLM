“Are you at the East campus?”
Zhou Tu hesitated for a moment, both the senior students and the teachers had warned the new students not to go near the East campus, they didn't explain the specific reason, but from the tone of their voice, it could be heard that the East campus is very dangerous.
“You have a deep misunderstanding about the East campus, in fact, it's not much different from here, it's just that the management of the two campuses is completely different, they live in real terror, while you live in a false happiness.”
Chen Ge looked at Zhou Tu's eyes: “Compared to you, they are actually closer to hope, because they at least know who they are, and know the way to be relieved.”
Chen Ge did not deceive Zhou Tu, no matter if the students are from the East campus or the West campus, they are all trapped in this school.
The memories of the students in the West campus have been modified, repeating the lives made by the black hands behind the scenes, but the students in the East campus at least know how to find a substitute ghost and find a way to leave.
“Are the students in the East school closer to hope?”
“But I heard that only the unwanted garbage from the West campus would be sent there.”
Zhou Tu has been moved, but he still feels unsteady in his heart.
“No matter what the criteria for judgment is, any school that treats students as garbage must be a garbage school.”
Chen Ge pointed to the high wall in the middle of the two campuses and said, "Do you know why that wall exists?"
"Why?"
"Because the school is afraid of losing control. They try to reshape humanity in various ways, but they forget that humanity is the most complex thing in the world."
"Things have already happened, no matter how to forget, the wounds left will always be imprinted in the heart."
"Just because you don't remember something doesn't mean it doesn't exist, so some of the school's plans are bound to fail."
Chen Ge spoke some words that the club members didn't understand. They didn't know why Chen Ge said that, but they felt that there was some truth to what he said.
A child's curiosity is heavy, and Chen Ge keeps telling them the truth about the school, and eventually succeeds in arousing the interest of the club members.
"Should we go now?"
"To be honest, I really don't believe there's a studio in my dream in the East Campus," Zhou Tu said in a low voice.
"Now is not the time."
Chen Ge turned back and looked at his shadow, the black shadow in the 413 dormitory was still sleeping, but his body had changed a lot.
If you look closely, you will find that Chen Ge's shadow is different from others, as black as ink, as if all light that shines there will be swallowed up.
It seems to have gotten much stronger.
The great potential of the black shadow is a good thing for Chen Ge, when he wakes up, Chen Ge will lead the students back to the east campus to search for the lost ghost again.
This will not only enhance their own strength but also stir up the stagnant water in the school and cover up the other "killer" in the college.
"It is still a stage of accumulating strength, and before the school master discovers me, this little worm, I will prepare as many aces as possible for myself."
Chen Ge turned his head to look at Wang Yicheng, he understood the stories of the other three club members, only the first club member, the lame boy was left: "The next place we are going to is Wang Yicheng's dormitory."
"Go to my dorm?"
Wang Yicheng was a bit strange after hearing this, he waved his hand repeatedly: "Forget it, there's nothing interesting in the dorm I live in."
"Your voice is higher than usual when you say this, your speed is faster, your eyes are vague, you are really not good at lying."
"Chen Ge gently hugged Wang Yicheng's shoulder: "Why don't you want to let us go?"," 
"Are you worried about what we will see?"," 
"I...," 
Wang Yicheng thought for half a day and didn't know what to say, and finally his gaze turned to another direction: "Nothing, let's just go directly," 
"Okay," 
Wang Yicheng lives in room 413 in the West Campus, and Lin Sisi lives in room 413 in the East Campus. 
The room numbers are completely the same, but except for bed number 4, all the beds in room 413 in the West Campus are occupied by students, while in the East Campus, it is exactly the opposite, only bed number 4 is occupied, and all the other beds are empty." 
"Don't tell other people the secrets in our club, everyone tries to be low-key, there are teachers in this school who are like me, and there are also teachers who are not easy to talk to." 
Chen Ge always remains vigilant. The noise they made in the experimental building was too loud, and the school is likely to have begun investigating." 
"Time is running out for me, after seeing room 413, I need to avoid the wind first."
"There are four male dormitory buildings in the West Campus, with a number of students several times that of the East Campus. Now it is not yet time to turn off the lights, and this is the busiest time for the male dormitory building. The sound of washing, falling plastic basin, and conversation can be clearly heard from the ground floor."
"This building is similar to the East Campus."
"Chen Ge acted very naturally, following four students into the first building."
"The house where the dorm manager lives is closed, but the glass windows are open. There is an old lady in her fifties humming inside, and she looks happy."
"A notice is posted next to the window, stating that it is forbidden for students to use high-powered electrical appliances in the dormitory and to cook in the dormitory."
"I remember that the notice in the East Campus dormitory building said - recently there have been malicious incidents, and students are forbidden to go out after turning off the lights."
"A wall away, it's almost two worlds, just like "inside" and "outside" the door."
"Walking through the corridor, Chen Ge and several club members arrived at the door of dormitory 413."
"This dormitory is no different from other dormitories."
"Wang Yicheng opened the door. After he entered the room, the others in the dormitory seemed to ignore him as if he didn't exist. No one talked to him while they were doing their own things."
"After Wang Yicheng took a few steps inside, the man sleeping next to the door of the room suddenly opened the mosquito net and glared at him: 'How many times do I have to say it?'"
"Come in and close the door yourself. Are your legs lame and your ears also not working?"
"The man spoke very unpleasantly and he didn't know why he seemed to dislike Wang Yicheng."
"He didn't close the door because there was still someone else coming in. If you need to apologize, a few of us can apologize on his behalf, we just don't know what kind of apology you need."
"Chen Ge grabbed the door handle and entered the room. He glanced at the other people in the dorm."
"The man in the mosquito net was intimidated when he saw Chen Ge and didn't speak, black-faced, and pulled up the mosquito net again."
"Mr. Bai, this is bed number four. Because no one is living there, we use it to store our luggage."
"Wang Yicheng pointed to bed number four, with several luggage boxes thrown on it. Only his luggage was under his own bed in the room, and others had thrown their clutter and luggage onto bed number four."
"Chen Ge is very familiar with bed number four. He himself has slept on bed number four in the East Campus."
"Walking to the side of bed number four, although this bed was not inhabited, it was still covered with bedding and sheets, but those bedding supplies were now dirty with luggage and clutter."
