"Zhuque."
Inside the bamboo house, Bai Yan was looking at Bai Xiaochen and Little Dragon playing and frolicking, and suddenly, she heard a noisy sound from outside. Her eyebrows furrowed and she said, "What happened outside? Why is there a noise?"
"You go out and take a look."
Zhuque saluted and took the order, stepping out of the bamboo house half a beat later. She hesitantly said, "Queen, there are two people outside who are looking for you."
"Looking for me?"
Bai Yan raised her eyebrows, "I'll go out and take a look. Who's looking for me?"
With that, she slowly stood up from her chair and headed towards the door.
Outside, under the blood-colored sky, two people tremulously crawled forward. Perhaps they had crawled too much, causing a bloodstain to flow down their bodies, falling into Bai Yan's eyes, particularly glaring.
"What are you doing?"
Bai Yan's eyebrows furrowed, and she asked coldly.
"The two elders had pale faces, shaking bodies crawling on the ground, stammering, 'Queen, I came to apologize to you. That day, I was too trusting of the imposter and caused you to misunderstand the king. It was all my fault. I am willing to be beaten or scolded. Please, Queen, forgive me.'"
"No, Queen, it's my fault. I failed to deliver the king's command to you. In fact, the king left the palace to relieve the seal on the world, and he asked me to come back and inform you. I was unable to do so, which gave the wicked person an opportunity."
"Fire feathers knelt on the ground, tears on his face, 'All the mistakes are my fault. Queen, if you want to hit or scold me, I will not object.' He brought the bamboo strip behind him to his hands, holding it with both hands and presenting it to the white face. He lowered his head deeply and had a death wish."
"The white face slowly gripped the bamboo strip presented by Fire Feathers. Her expression was calm and her eyes had an undecipherable light."
"As if sensing the bamboo strip was released, Fire Feathers' body stiffened. He tightly bit his teeth and waited for that overwhelming strike."
"But... "
"For a long time, no pain came."
"Fire Feathers looked up in surprise, only to see a burst of flames from the bamboo strip in the hands of the white face, instantly burning to ashes."
"You've suffered a lot along the way?"
"King... Queen?"
Fire feather watches Bai Yan uncertainly, perhaps not understanding what she means.
"If so, then your sin has already been redeemed, get up."
Bai Yan has always been a clear person in the company. She only targets those who foolishly want to harm her.
On that day, she could be deceived, let alone the Grand Elder and Fire feather? Therefore, she never blamed them...
Fire feather's body stiffened like iron, unable to believe that Bai Yan would let them go so easily.
Before coming, they had already prepared for a full-body wound!
Nowadays, she even didn't scold them, and their sin was eliminated.
Seeing the two people kneeling on the ground motionless, Bai Yan's face sank slightly: "What?"
"Are you still waiting for me to help you up?"
The woman's harsh voice fell into Fire feather's ears, shocking Fire feather to immediately crawl up from the ground. His pants were covered in fresh blood and he couldn't stand steadily.
Despite all this, he still stood on the ground, his legs trembling, but he didn't continue to kneel.
White face looked at the two people who were struggling to support themselves, pointing to the stone seat on the ground: "Sit down, take a rest and you can go down the mountain."
