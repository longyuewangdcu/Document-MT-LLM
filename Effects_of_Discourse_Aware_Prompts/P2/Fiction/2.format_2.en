Under the suppression of the machine gun, there was chaos in the base and no one noticed that a special forces had infiltrated the camp.
With little effort, Kutebov placed a beacon on the designated target and then withdrew from the base with his team, safely arriving at the evacuation point and calling for an air strike.
Soon, Russian stealth bombers roared past from above the clouds, dropping four bombs that accurately hit two ammo depots and two fuel depots in the base.
The shockwave from the explosion swept across the camp, collapsing concrete buildings around it.
The exploding ammo and burning fireballs flew across the camp, causing a chain reaction of explosions everywhere, with flames and blood and corpses everywhere.
Nearly half of the guards stationed in the camp were immediately lost, and the rest were mostly injured, with hardly a whole person left.
Medical soldiers carried stretchers and walked through the base, searching for injured soldiers who had lost mobility.
Engineers wearing heavy explosion-proof suits rushed into the fire, risking their lives to pull out unexploded ammo from the rubble.
The soldiers who could still move all got up and searched for their own troops to gather.
Salter watched the firelight outside the window, and a layer of despair gradually appeared in his sluggish pupils.
"Thick smoke covered the entire base and the fire lit the whole night sky red, like the end of the world."
"Xiete..."
"Muttering to himself, he moved his lead-filled legs away from the window."
"Turning around, he met the gaze of the commander's staff."
"Commander, what should we do?"
"The aftermath of the explosion finally subsided, and there was no longer any sound of ammunition exploding in the base, but the mood of everyone could not be calmed. The mercenaries who escaped from the explosion knew that the beginning of their nightmare was next."
"The previous explosion seemed to ignite a signal, sounding the horns of the Sami army's attack."
"Under Jiang Chen's instructions, Sami seized this fleeting opportunity, stood in front of everyone, waved his arms and shouted, and led the remaining mobs to the front line."
"More than six thousand people ran on the tundra, rushing towards the flickering pine forest."
"Looking from a distance, the scene was very spectacular."
At the same time, all the mercenaries fighting on the front line were panicked as they looked at the thick smoke rising from the base behind them, and their morale fell to the bottom in an instant.
When faced with the incoming mob like a tidal wave, even though they had the strength to hold the line, they had no heart to continue fighting.
There was no doubt that Arrow Company's defense was broken through, and the resisting mercenaries were defeated by the massive tactics of the Sami army.
Some people escaped back into the burning base, but most of them deserted and fled into the depths of the forest.
No need for Jiang Chen to remind, even the boss should know what to do at this point.
Watching Sami attack the military base with the mob, Jiang Chen put away his binoculars, summoned the off-road motorcycle he had prepared from the storage space, and gently patted Aiysha's back.
"It's about time, let's go."
"Hmm!"
Aiysha nodded in response and, after Jiang Chen sat on the motorcycle, she nimbly straddled him from behind.
The engine roared and the tires cut through a layer of broken snow.
Jiang Chen rode his off-road motorcycle down the slope, bringing Ayisha around to the side of the base and stopping the motorcycle by the side of the road. He pulled out a laser sword from the storage space and casually swung it a couple of times, effortlessly cutting through the wire-woven protective wall.
The entire base was immersed in fire and chaos, with the occasional sound of a mortar being heard. All armed mercenaries were at the front line, fighting for control of the base's main gate with the rioters.
Except for a guard team guarding the command center, there was no one left in the entire rear area.
For Jiang Chen and Ayisha, it was no different from being unguarded.
There were a total of ten guards, with two guards standing on the watchtower and the remaining eight standing at the entrance of the first and second floors.
Ayisha took out a ghost sniper rifle and quietly eliminated the two guards on the watchtower. Then, using the dead angle of her vision, she killed eight people on the upper and lower floors one by one.
After Ayisha had dealt with the guards outside the command center, Jiang Chen took out his rifle and walked towards the main gate. Just as he passed the Hummer car at the entrance, he collided with Sardes and the command center's chief of staff who had fled from the command center in a hurry.
When they looked up at each other, both sides were clearly stunned.
The chief of staff was the first to react, immediately reaching into his chest to draw his gun, but before his hand reached his chest, he was shot in the head by the quicker-reacting Ayisha.
Sardes was about to resist, but was easily controlled by Jiang Chen, who reversed his hands and pressed them against the nearby Hummer.
"Salutes, male, 43 years old."
"Is it correct that you are the CEO and Commanding Officer of Arrow Company?"
"Although this is the first time we have met, the holographic helmet connected to the ghost agent database that Jiang Chen is wearing has stored his photo and personal information."
"With just a glance, information about him was projected on the holographic screen."
"With his face pressed against the car hood, Salutes still has some grit, he gritted his teeth and refused to surrender."
"I won't say anything, just kill me..."
"Kill you?"
"I haven't even asked you anything yet."
"Jiang Chen chuckled, completely disregarding his uncooperative attitude, and pulled out a needle tube with his right hand and unceremoniously poked it into his back shoulder."
"Urgh!"
A scream of resistance came from his throat, Saldes stared with bloodshot eyes, but soon the expression in his pupils faded away. 
Jiang Chen simply loosened his grip, it was impossible for an ordinary person to resist even after being injected with truth serum. 
Jiang Chen turned Saldes over and asked him in a deliberate tone. 
"Where is Carmen?" 
"In the research institute of the underground shelter..." 
"Where is the underground shelter?" 
"The entrance is in the center of the base, accessible only by elevator." 
"Next to the entrance there are two landing pads, you can see them as you walk over." 
With one question and one answer, Jiang Chen soon obtained the information he wanted. 
"Very well, now you can have your wish."
Jiang Chen pulled out his gun and shot a bullet into his head, then threw his body aside.
This was a fairly painless death, but for the well-known Arrow Company CEO Mr. Saldes, dying in such an obscure way might be more painful than death itself... if dead people can feel pain.
"Underground bunker?"
Looking towards the central direction of the base, Jiang Chen's mouth corners hooked up a cold smile.
No matter what Carmon was still scheming, his luck should be up.
The fate of the Roschield family will be like how they started, rising to fame because of a war, dying obscurely because of a war...
However, at that moment, a pitiful screech came from afar.
