Yán rú shēng gave her a white eye and said, "Wén Xǔ Xǔ, you are self-obsessed."
"Don't I look good?"
Wén Xǔ Xǔ frowned and pouted, pretending to be angry.
Yán rú shēng hesitated and then laughed, holding Xǔ Xǔ's upper body with one hand and squeezing her chest hard.
He lowered his head and glared at her, biting his teeth and saying, "Cunning foolish woman."
He quickened his pace, walked to the bed, threw Xǔ Xǔ onto the bed without hesitation, and then unbuttoned his shirt one by one.
He unbuckled his belt, took off all the restraints, and then climbed into the bed and pressed on Xǔ Xǔ.
Simple and rough, not romantic at all.
His deep black eyes met hers and Xǔ Xǔ's heartbeat accelerated uncontrollably.
Yes, after being together for so many years, every time she looks into his eyes, her heart still beats like a deer, feeling shy and embarrassed.
"Perhaps it's because we're too familiar, always feeling embarrassed."
"So people say that it's hard to make a move on someone you're familiar with and rabbits don't eat the grass by their burrow, it's really like that."
"Watching Xuxu's face turn red with embarrassment, speaking impulsively and excitedly but also annoyed, the excitement is an automatic response from the hormones in his body, and the annoyance comes from within."
"Although he likes to see her shy appearance, he doesn't like her being so reserved and not taking the initiative because she's shy and always so reserved."
"What else do you want to hear? I already told you, you look at me."
"Yanshu forcibly held Xuxu's face in his hands and forced her to look into his eyes."
"Xuxu's face turned even redder, she pouted her lips, her gaze wandering uncertainly, "Then you hurry up and say, did you steal someone else's love letter for me?"
"Uh..."
"Yanshu was thinking while speaking, "Aside from Zhao Zheng's love letter, Jiang Zhuohong's chocolate and movie ticket, there's also the colorful stick bar owned by the son of the police station head, Hao Bang, from the year above us."
Upon hearing this, Xuxu was very surprised, "What? Hao Bang?"
"The science prodigy who is known as 'praised by ten thousand people'?",
"The reason why he is known as 'praised by ten thousand people' is because of his name, not because ten thousand people actually praise him. Whenever someone says his name, they are praising him for being awesome.",
"At the time, she heard the name and knew that there was someone in the school with that name, and felt negative about it.",
"Isn't that guy just a bookworm? How could he send her something?",
"Yeah, the name is really cheap. The person who named him is even cheaper.",
"He said with a disdainful look on his face, "Thankfully I ate that lollipop for you. It was rainbow-colored, all dyed with food coloring. At the time, my tongue and lips were all different colors. It's junk food, cheap stuff."",
"Xu Xu: '...'",
"According to him, she should thank him for eating something that someone else sent her?",
"Xu Xu felt both angry and amused. She couldn't help herself and poked him on the head, saying, "Yan Ru Sheng, why don't you go to heaven?"",
"It's really taking advantage and still trying to sell out. This is something he likes to do the most."
She finished speaking and looked at him, amusingly asking, "So, you didn't like Director Hao because of Hao Bang?"
Although it was a question, her tone was firm.
"..." Yan Ru Sheng kept his mouth shut and nodded silently, as if to accept it.
Xu Xu fell into his deep black eyes again without caution, she made an "uh" sound and awkwardly moved her gaze elsewhere.
Then she asked, "How did you do all of this? How come I don't know?"
She rolled her eyes, as if she was searching for something to talk about.
