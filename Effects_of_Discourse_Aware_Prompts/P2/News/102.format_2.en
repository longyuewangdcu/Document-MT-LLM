"Asian-American groups complain of discrimination in admissions by Yale and other 3 Ivy League schools - Xinhua News Agency"
"More than 130 Asian-American groups submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against the discrimination of Asian-American applicants by three Ivy League schools: Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College in the admission process. - Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei)"
"The Asian-American Education Alliance, which took the lead in initiating the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day."
"The chairman of the group, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria for American universities has doubled, but in these three American universities, the proportion of Asian-Americans has remained at the same level."
"Many studies have shown that these universities have been systematically and persistently discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the so-called "holistic" admission process."
"Zhao Yukong introduced that a study by scholars including Sander in 2014 showed that among these three universities, Asian-Americans have the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants. "
"Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years."
"Zhao Yukong told Xinhua reporters that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice to launch an investigation after submitting the complaint and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in admissions after determining the facts."
"They also expect the universities being complained about to take this issue seriously and change their admission policies for Asian-Americans."
"At present, the three universities being complained about have not responded."
"The Asian-American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had previously complained about Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons."
"In addition to Chinese-American groups, this time the complaint also involves education groups of Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American origin."
