"After the 'Democratic Summit' ended on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman spoke on Saturday (December 11th) and said that the United States' hosting of the 'Leaders' Democratic Summit' is a means of dividing lines based on ideology, weaponizing democracy and undermining democracy under the guise of democracy, stirring up division and confrontation, and transferring domestic conflicts.
The Chinese government believes that for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and value system on others, promoted 'democratic transformation,' carried out unilateral sanctions, incited 'color revolutions,' and caused disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has already become a 'large-scale lethal weapon' used by the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day conference was held via video and leaders from 111 countries around the world were invited to attend, including the leader of Taiwan, but leaders from China and Russia were not invited."
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia criticized the US over its own problems with democracy, claiming that the US was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also voices of criticism both internationally and in the US, such as criticism of leaders invited to the conference, including some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, and some people doubt the true intention of the Biden government to organize this summit for democracy, not for geopolitical purposes.
The newly elected German Chancellor, Schr√∂der, also participated in the video democracy summit.
A statement from China's Foreign Ministry on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is showing signs of sickness, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, party opposition, political polarization, social division, racial conflict, and wealth differentiation becoming more and more intense." American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a capital base.
US President Biden stated in his speech, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the safeguards of democracy, drive reforms, achieve transparent accountability, and better resist the forces of authoritarianism and those who blatantly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not a matter of course, "We must constantly renew it among every generation, in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our era."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend them at a time of persistent and worrying challenges."
The American side promised to launch a one-year action after this democracy summit, including an initiative of $424.4 million to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent media.
The United States hopes that all countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the planned physical democracy summit to be held at the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year."
