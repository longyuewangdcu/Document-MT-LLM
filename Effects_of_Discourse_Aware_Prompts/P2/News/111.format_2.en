"Education Thinking: How to Let 'Academic Elites' and 'Underachievers' Get What They Deserve in University Exams - Xinhua News Agency" 
"Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders expressing their confusion about university exams and calling for increased difficulty, diversified exam formats, and a better reflection of students' actual levels." 
"Indeed, university exams have been a "hot topic" for a long time." 
"In university campuses, students come from all walks of life and have different levels of ability and learning progress, creating an extremely diverse student body." 
"It is inevitable that there will be different perceptions when conducting assessments for such a diverse group."
Of course, if the exam questions are monotonous, with a high repetition rate, and too simple, it will inevitably result in a completely different feeling.
Students who don't study hard may be able to pass the exam with a last-minute cramming session. If they find other ways, they may achieve a two-for-one effect.
In this way, "weak students" who do not invest much in their studies can still pass the exam or even get high scores, while "top students" who never miss class and have good homework and notes do not score much higher than others.
Therefore, the reflection of the students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University on the problems in the university exams is not without reason, and it is believed that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this perspective, we should give a thumbs up to the three students who wrote the letter to the university leaders.
Actually, those who have been to college are aware that cramming for exams, seeking various ways to get exam questions from teachers, trying to define the scope of the exam, and seeking "priority tutoring" before exams are not uncommon, and even bringing in cheat sheets during exams and seeking higher grades from teachers after exams are not unusual.
In the author's opinion, as a way of evaluating the quality of education, measuring the qualification of a college exam is more about teachers' comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning and the scientific proposition based on this.
Entering the undergraduate stage, the major begins to be subdivided, and many major courses are mainly based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether to grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject comprehensively is what the college exam will test.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theories and general knowledge of the subject, and from the perspective of knowledge points, the space for change is not large and is basically fixed.
"As a teacher once said, 'The basics of university mathematics studied 20 years ago are still being studied today, and are still the focus.'"
"But the basic knowledge points remain unchanged, which does not mean that the examination questions are single and repeated."
"In many universities, the examination is generally composed by a question-setting group, and then organized by senior subject teachers, and the examination marking is also participated by all teachers who are responsible for the subject, so as to overcome the situation of repeated questions to a certain extent."
"However, to draft a set of questions that are in line with the reality of teaching and learning, the difficulty level of the questions is normally distributed based on the overall learning situation of the students, and it also requires a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation and a comprehensive analysis of the level of student learning, so that the examination proposal can dynamically grasp the difficulty and type of questions, highlighting the examination of basic knowledge and incorporating ability assessment, while also innovating the design of question types."
"Examinations are the steering wheel of university education. Whatever type of examination there is, students will have corresponding preparation plans, and over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education."
"Lanzhou Jiaotong University highly values the suggestions from students regarding their letters, and has already deployed a rectification plan throughout the school."
"Each teaching unit is required to organize teachers to conduct research and self-check the comparison between the final exams and the course content, as well as formulate the examination questions and related regulations. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen supervision and inspection of the examination question formulation and review process, refine the grading of grades, and comprehensively assess each stage of course teaching."
"Solving the problem of a single type of examination question and repeated questions is an issue that university examination affairs needs to face from a mechanism perspective. Of course, there needs to be corresponding regulations, but the key to success lies in daily work. Teachers need to have a comprehensive understanding of the teaching situation, not only grasping the teaching content, but also the students' learning situation. When both the teacher and student have a thorough understanding, teaching and learning will be better connected and form a virtuous interaction, and the exams will be more in line with reality, allowing both the 'excellent students' and the 'average students' to receive what they deserve."
