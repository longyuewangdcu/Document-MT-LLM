3,200 new born babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper
The Sabah National Registration Department announced that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper, birth certificates for newborn babies cannot be issued since early October, and the accumulated number of affected individuals has reached 3,200 so far
However, the head of the department, Kuraimus, guarantees that all newborns who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system and the certificates will be issued when the anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week
At a press conference, he explained in response to a news report by a media website that the issue of Sabah's birth certificate printing had been ongoing for ten months
He said that the problem had arisen two months ago and that Sarawak is facing the same problem
"One reason is that the Chinese manufacturer of the special anti-counterfeit paper was affected by the pandemic, causing a delay in its arrival to our country."
"He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used in Sabah birth certificates is different from that in other regions and cannot be borrowed from other states."
"Keru Amilus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on February 6th and was handed over to the printing company for some printing work on the 8th."
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, return to Sabah immediately for the final printing stage, and it is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant in two working days (February 20th)."
"We will notify applicants to go to various branches to pick up their birth certificates."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 20,801 birth certificates so far this year.
