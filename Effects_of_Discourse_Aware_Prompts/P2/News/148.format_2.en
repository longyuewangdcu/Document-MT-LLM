"Negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours and setting up 'buffer zones': The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism releases a document calling for strengthening epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News Agency" 
"Beijing, December 11th (reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiance) - The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities. It requires that people who recently left port cities on land borders (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) need to have a nucleic acid test result negative within 48 hours, and people traveling to port cities on land borders must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival. - Xinhua News Agency" 
"According to the notice, the above requirements are in effect from the day the port cities are determined and announced by each province, region, and city, to March 15, 2022." 
"In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions may study setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction." 
"A relevant official from the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy and both sides of the border have frequent interactions."
Implementing differentiated management policies based on regions, changing from one line of defense to two lines of defense, is expected to achieve an advance in the front line of control, reduce the risk of epidemic outbreaks, and achieve the greatest effectiveness in epidemic control with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent times, there have been multiple outbreaks of local cluster epidemics in our country, all of which were imported from abroad through gateway cities.
The aforementioned notice points out that this reveals some problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and warning in some places, the failure to implement the closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, routine nucleic acid testing becoming mere formality, cold-chain items not being effectively eliminated at all links, irregular management of centralized quarantine facilities, and emergency handling of epidemics not being scientific and accurate enough.
The notice requires that efforts be made in nine areas, including improving the mechanism of epidemic prevention and control in gateway cities, enhancing the epidemic monitoring and warning system, and implementing border control measures, among others. The goal is to quickly fill in the gaps and weaknesses in epidemic prevention and control in gateway cities, to do the work of prevention and control scientifically and accurately without relaxing, and to tighten the defense line against imports.
The notice emphasizes that the gateway cities should coordinate their research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security, publish and open a people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check for hidden dangers in the supply of basic living necessities and prices, promptly solve and actively respond to outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the mentioned port cities include counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water, and air ports are open, as well as the cities (places, states, leagues) and directly-administered municipalities they are located in. The specific scope will be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) based on epidemic prevention and control needs and promptly announced.
