"Don't Let Fear Paralyze You at the Starting Line - Xinhua News" 
"When visiting a book market, one often senses the popularity of self-help books on success." 
"Many of the success books available today promote 'the best principles' - that is, they first assume or imply that you can 'achieve' and then tell you what you need to do to 'achieve' it." 
"In other words, they skip the most important and fundamental part, which is 'how to achieve it.'" 
"This is why these books all have a common characteristic - either you go all out and do your best, or don't do anything at all; either 100% or 0%; either climb Mount Tai or stay put right where you are."
This "best principle" looks right to everyone, but 99% of people will be scared before they even start running.
Because this theory promotes a path of "you have to make a determined effort, start anew, and make a 180-degree transformation", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who are conservative, resistant to change, and refuse to change, you want to shout "you have to change" in their ear, which is self-deception and a meaningless act.
Most people will be intimidated by the word "transformation" and hesitate to make a move. Or, driven by a momentary impulse, they made a determination to "transform," and bravely took the first step, but often it was short-lived, and could not continue for long.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "Starting from Tomorrow" cross-talk perfectly expresses this "universal human nature" in a vivid way.
"The biggest problem with the 'best principle' is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limit of ordinary people and making most people look on with admiration." 
"Perhaps, the 'second best principle' is a way that can lead more ordinary people to relatively successful paths." 
"The core of the 'second best principle' is to 'lower the threshold' - it encourages a theory of 'accumulating small wins as a big win', that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that is still stronger than standing still." 
"In short, as long as you do something, it's always stronger than doing nothing." 
"Due to the significant reduction in threshold, there is a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and as long as they persist, the probability of success will increase."
The path to success by following the "second-best principle" is only slightly longer.
In conclusion, although the "best principle" is marketed as a way for everyone to succeed, it actually only motivates a few people in the end, while the "second-best principle" effectively motivates more people and benefits as many as possible.
