"The resource accumulation of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year, according to Xinhua News." 
"According to the latest monitoring results from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office of Qinghai Province, the resource accumulation of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 thousand tons compared to last year, reaching 10.85 thousand tons, which is more than 40 times higher than the accumulation in 2002 when the protection first began. 
"Naked carp, commonly known as 'Yu fish' in Qinghai Lake, is a precious species unique to the lake and plays a significant role in maintaining the 'water-fish-bird' ecological chain security and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake watershed." 
"In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as massive hunting and the degradation of breeding water environments, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. In 2002, the resource accumulation of naked carp was only 2592 tons." 
"In 2004, naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the 'China Species Red List.'"
"Starting from 2003, Qinghai province implements lake closure for fish culture, prohibiting any units, collectives, and individuals from fishing naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products." 
"At the same time, measures such as artificial breeding and releasing, cleaning up the main rivers that flow into Qinghai Lake, and designing scientifically reasonable "fish passages" are being taken to increase the protection efforts, and the stock of naked carp in Qinghai Lake is increasing year by year." 
"Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially bred and released in Qinghai Lake, and the contribution rate to the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 23%." 
"The Three-River-Source area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservancy area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification in the west to the east." 
"In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three-River-Source area and the water area of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Tibetan Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing ban announcements for key water areas of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river, one lake."
