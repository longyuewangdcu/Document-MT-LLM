"Chongqing Vocational School piloting modern apprenticeship system, admission is equivalent to being a company employee - Xinhua News"
"Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, 60 vocational schools in the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model. Students who are accepted for pilot training will have the status of apprentices and will be pre-recorded as unit employees by pilot enterprises after enrollment."
"The Municipal Education Commission requires standardizing the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools and clarifying the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and company employees. According to the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools, and enterprises sign a three-party agreement. For apprentices who are 16 years old but have not yet reached 18 years old, a four-party agreement must be signed between apprentices, guardians, schools, and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific posts, teaching content, and rights protection for on-the-job training."
"Encouraging pilot schools to adopt the form of modern apprenticeship and jointly carry out pre-employment training and job transfer training with cooperating enterprises."
"Pilot schools need to reform the talent training model."
"School and enterprise jointly design talent training programs, jointly develop professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans."
"The pilot takes the training system as one pilot cycle, and the student's internship time in the enterprise is determined according to the talent training plan. On-the-job training is generally 6 months."
"In corporate practice, the enterprise team-based management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students are skilled in the skills required for each rotation job."
"According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city determined 60 city-level vocational modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot having about 50 people and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained."
"According to the principle of first piloting, then implementing, and gradually advancing from point to surface, we explore establishing a long-term mechanism for joint school-enterprise recruitment, joint training, and integrated education, effectively improving students' job skills, and enhancing students' employment rate and employment quality."
