The organizer of China-Saudi collaborates to hold the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia.
The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, the Diriye Contemporary Art Biennial, officially opened to the public on December 12th in the JAX Art District located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China, among other places, participated in the exhibition.
The biennial was jointly planned by the Diriye Biennial Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Fei Yun, the director of UCCA, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennial is "Feeling Our Way Across the River," which serves as a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transition period and reflects the current state of Saudi society and culture.
The biennial covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Feeling Our Way Across the River," "Heritage as Experiment," "Peripheral Thinking," "Towards the Public," "A Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibition, covering a variety of forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also attracting attention, with some artists creating in a novel way using recycled materials, for example, Xu Bing in "The Story Behind the Series: Endless Streams and Mountains" (2014), reconstructed a classic landscape painting using waste materials.
According to Baku, CEO of the Diriye Annual Show Foundation, it is hoped that this biennial exhibition will establish an international dialogue and allow a global audience to understand Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community and strengthen the interaction between them.
Tian Feiyu said, "The biennial exhibition has a dual purpose: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to be part of the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the biennial exhibition period, and artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.
