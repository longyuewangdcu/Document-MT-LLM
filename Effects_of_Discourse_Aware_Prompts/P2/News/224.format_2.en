"Starry Night Appointment | Gemini Meteor Shower to Reach its Peak on the 14th - Xinhua News"
"Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th (Reporter Zhou Runjian) Astronomical science popularization experts introduce that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, one of the three largest meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, the Gemini meteor shower, will reach its peak on December 14th. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the late night of that day."

"Most of the parent bodies of meteor showers are periodic comets, but the parent body of the Gemini meteor shower is the 3200 Phaethon asteroid, which is an Apollo-type asteroid."
"The Gemini meteor shower is also currently the second known meteor shower not "gestated" by a comet."
Xiulipeng, a director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and a popularizer of astronomy, introduced that like New Year's films, the Gemini Meteor Shower generally appears at the end of the year and its "release period" can last from December 4th to 17th.
The Gemini Meteor Shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is called one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere along with the Geminids and the Perseids.
One notable feature of the Gemini Meteor Shower is that the meteor bodies are relatively slow, colorful, and there are also many fireballs, making it suitable for both visual observation and astronomical photography for beginners.
Yang Jing, a Tianjin astronomical enthusiast, took a photo of the Gemini Meteor Shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13th, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Gemini Meteor Shower will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14th, with the ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observing conditions when the radiant is directly overhead) being 150 at its maximum.

"Last year, the dazzling Gemini meteor shower left a profound impression on people, but this year's Gemini meteor shower will be affected by moonlight interference, and its level of excitement will be discounted a little bit." 
"On the 14th, it is the 11th day of the 11th lunar month, the moon phase is a full convex moon, the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, but fortunately the moon will set later in the night, and at this time the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower will also rise relatively high." 
"Friends who like meteor showers can observe in these hours after the moon sets later in the night, but be sure to protect against the cold and keep warm." 
"How can you observe more meteor showers as much as possible?"
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, facing northeast direction, and have a wide field of view in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently until the moon sets, and then observe with your eyes." 
"It should be noted that the flow of the Gemini meteor shower in all directions is very large, so you don't have to keep looking at the radiation point of the Gemini meteor shower while observing." 
"Photography enthusiasts who want to take stunning 'meteor shower photos' should choose a wide-angle, large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting." 
"For stability and continuity considerations, a tripod, spare battery, and cable release are also essential."
