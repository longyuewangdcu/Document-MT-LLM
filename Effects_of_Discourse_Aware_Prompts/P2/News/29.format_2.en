"South African doctors: Although the Omega variant is highly contagious, it mostly causes mild symptoms."
"Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the new coronavirus Omega variant causes less severe symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster."
"According to the Associated Press, as the Omega variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization of over 5,000 doctors in the province of KwaZulu-Natal reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as physical pain and coughing, similar to flu-like symptoms."
"The director of the organization, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but no one has yet required hospitalization."
"Dr. Pillay says, 'They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation.'"
He said this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are normally more susceptible to severe illness from coronavirus infections. 
He said that compared to the previous outbreak with the Delta variant, the coronavirus patients he treated had "breathing difficulties and low oxygen levels," 
and many needed hospitalization within a few days. 
Two weeks after the first report of the Alpha variant in Southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences. 
Although it will take a few more weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to a summary from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in South Africa: Among the recent COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital, only 30% are severe cases, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the pandemic; the average length of hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% died, while in the early outbreak of the disease in South Africa, the death rate was 20%.
The head of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, citing data and other reports from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, says: "At present, almost all indicators suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also says: "It's still early, and we need to gather more data."
"Normally, hospitalization and death occur later, but we have only been into this wave of the pandemic for two weeks."
At the same time, scientists from around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, and testing the effectiveness of the current vaccines and treatment methods.
Despite Delata still being the major global variant of the novel coronavirus, cases of the Omega variant are appearing in dozens of countries with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak. 
According to health officials, the number of new cases in the Western Cape province increased by 400% in the first week of December and tests show that cases of the Omega variant make up over 90%.
