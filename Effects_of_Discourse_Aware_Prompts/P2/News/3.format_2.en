"Students take center stage at Zhejiang University's academic conference, research achievements stimulate imagination - Xinhua News Agency"
"At Zhejiang University's 2016 academic conference opening ceremony yesterday evening, a series of imaginative academic achievements were recognized. 
These achievements, mainly researched by students, covered a range of fields including the environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities and education. The students started with a curious point and created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have already won awards at home and abroad."
"Biological Sensor: Your Home Physical Exam Doctor"
"At the scene, the doctoral student team of the School of Biomedical Engineering, Zhang Diming, demonstrated a biological sensor that can be operated on a smart phone and is only half the size of a smart phone."
"You only need to breathe gently and this device can preliminary detect your physical health status from the composition of the exhaled gas."
"Zhang Diming introduced that this sensor is connected to a smart phone and after exhaling the gas, the health report will be displayed on the phone."
"Intelligent wristbands on the market that can detect health status generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse."
"This biological sensor utilizes graphene, a new type of material, and its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive 'sense of smell' enables it to reflect the physical health status more deeply and accurately."
"Intelligent Operating Lamp: A High-Energy Eye for Doctors"
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights have also been used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver award at the 44th Swiss Geneva International Invention Exhibition this year.
The team of Masters students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the College of Photonics and Engineering, opened up a new idea in the defects of traditional surgical lights, and invented the smart LED surgical shadowless lamp.
â€œMany early disease detection and removal problems are related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
Shen Junfei said that for example, during early detection of cancer, if the doctor cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will continue to spread later on.
This intelligent surgical light has four light panels, which can enhance the distinction of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the light spot according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical light has been tried in hospitals such as the Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Shao Yifu Hospital and Zhejiang University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Using air to wash your hands: saving water and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by simply rinsing with water, at most using a bit of soap and squeezing some hand sanitizer, but Li Qi Zhang and other classmates have invented a "air washing device".
Just by standing on the washing device, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump."
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with water.
In this way, we can wash our hands clean!
The color reaction and bacteria residue experiments prove that washing hands with this method is just as effective as traditional methods.
This device only relies on our own gravity as the driving force, which not only ensures the washing degree, but also saves 90% of water, and the whole process is completely energy-free and energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many world-class universities and won the only gold medal.
