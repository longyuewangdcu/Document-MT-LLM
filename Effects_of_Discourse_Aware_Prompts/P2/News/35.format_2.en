"Education Times Comment: What is needed to save abducted children?"
"If we use the famous public welfare slogan "No buying and selling, no killing", then in a good environment without the demand for abduction, group prevention and control and anti-abduction by the whole people will make the act of abduction unprofitable, risky and costly, and such crimes will no longer occur repeatedly."
"Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Public Security Ministry has launched an emergency release platform for missing children's information developed by the Anti-trafficking Office."
"This is an internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of missing children's information and to quickly find abducted children."
"I heard that the app is called "Reunion" and I feel a warm feeling."
"The new technology not only has a artistic name and full of emotion, but also applied informatization properly, practical and effective."
"The primary goal of cracking down on child trafficking is to retrieve the abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom."
"Secondary is the trial and punishment of the suspects."
"There are many big words that can be listed from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education in the meaning of criminal punishment."
"Before the trafficking case is cracked, the personal safety of the victims should be given priority."
The prioritization of matters and the urgency should be taken into consideration. Under the pressing goal of "rescue," controversial topics such as "should all child trafficking cases result in the death penalty" can be temporarily set aside and discussed carefully. However, the rescue of abducted children cannot be delayed.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, traffickers tend to leave the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
Every minute delay in the search and rescue operation may result in the children moving further away from their parents and making the case more difficult to solve.
In this situation, it is practical to take effective measures such as using platforms like "Reunion" that directly help solve the case and rescue the children.
After all, "anti-trafficking" is a task that requires the entire legal system to be properly operated.
Combating crime, protecting the rights and interests of children and their parents, from improving legislation to ensuring judicial protection, and from meticulous enforcement, all require the implementation of "caring for the young and helping the weak."
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be done better from families to society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three rests at a railway station, the parents sleep deeply, and they wake up to find the child missing.
We cannot expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as the parent of a young child, you should at least have a sufficient level of protection awareness.
For parents to take turns resting, or to place the child under secure protection, are the minimum measures to prevent child trafficking.
On the other side of the police's crackdown on child trafficking crimes, those who purchase kidnapped children should also be concerned and punished.
An individual's illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the legally prescribed punishment for the crime of child trafficking starts from 5 years imprisonment; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it can lead to the death penalty and confiscation of property.
With a high starting point for punishment and the most severe punishment, under the trend of "lenient punishment", the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to a more serious crime.
Yet there are still many cases of child trafficking occurring each year.
It can be seen that some people have a backward concept of raising children and a weak sense of the law. 
Legal education for these people should be updated accordingly.
Effective control of child trafficking crimes cannot rely solely on strict enforcement by the authorities. 
If the "market" for trafficking is widely available and traffickers are motivated by greed, they will constantly innovate trafficking methods, creating a situation of "fighting the law" with the enforcement authorities, and the fight against trafficking will inevitably fall into an inefficient quagmire. 
Therefore, eliminating outdated concepts, popularizing legal knowledge, and helping to root out the crime of trafficking and buying children is also helpful.
