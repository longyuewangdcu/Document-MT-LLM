"The Summit for Democracy has concluded, with President Biden stating that the fire of freedom will never be extinguished,"
"The virtual Summit for Democracy, convened by U.S. President Biden and attended by government leaders, citizens, civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, came to a close on Friday, December 10th."
"In his closing remarks, President Biden said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it."
"He also stated that plans are in place for a second global Summit for Democracy to be held next year."
"Taiwanese government representative Tang Feng and exiled Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong also spoke at the summit on the second day."
Biden said: "We know how challenging the work ahead of us is. 
But we also know that we can meet the challenge because, as I have said, democracy is everywhere, as this summit has shown. 
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the spark of freedom, it burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also stated that defending democracy requires the collective effort of society. 
He said: "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, fortify the safeguards of democracy, drive reforms, achieve transparent accountability, withstand the buffering and impacts of authoritarian forces, and those who brazenly seek power before the public good."
"The theme of the second day of the 'Democratic Summit' was respectively defending human rights, consolidating democracy and combating authoritarianism, and counter digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values."
"This day coincided with 'International Human Rights Day'."
"United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres also stated in his opening speech on the day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges worldwide, especially the challenges posed by emerging digital technologies."
"He said: 'Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions and the resilience of democracy.'"
"This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls."
This also requires a resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist, Joshua Wong, delivered a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation of minorities in China, such as the Uighur and Tibetan people in Hong Kong.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable."
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority.
Lo Guan-cong also calls for the free world to come together to counter the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and maybe some of you haven't realized the threat the (Chinese Communist Party) poses to our democratic values."
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason we must change.
Tang Feng, a member of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, delivered a video speech at a roundtable discussion titled "Combatting Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values," in which he issued a National Statement and emphasized that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against tyranny and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experiences in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At the time when democracy is flourishing in Taiwan, we always firmly stand at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and play a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have used public health and the collective interest as an excuse to justify human rights violations, and the global democracy has shown signs of regression.
However, in Taiwan, we were able to control the pandemic without having to lockdown cities, and defeat fake news without having to shut down websites.
The day after the "Democracy Summit," the US Department of Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea, and other countries that were deemed to seriously violate human rights, and also imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to use surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.
