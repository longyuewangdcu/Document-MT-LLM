"Girl serves as a target to raise funds for her sister: 'It's better than thinking about flesh wounds' - Xinhua News."
"In Hangzhou's Wulin Square, a girl stands in front of a large wooden board that says 'Human target, ten yuan per arrow'."
"Yesterday morning, a photo of a girl in Hangzhou serving as a target to raise funds for her sister went viral in friend circles."
"The photo shows the girl standing in front of a slightly taller wooden board in Hangzhou's Wulin Square, with the words 'Human target, ten yuan per arrow' written on it, indicating that people can shoot with a bow and arrow after paying."
"The act has sparked discussions among online users."
Last night, the publicity officer of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xiaocheng Branch confirmed to the New Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl made such extreme actions for her sister's fundraising, but this behavior is not worthy of promotion and after being advised, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl Street "Archery Target" Fundraising is Admonished
In the circulated photos, a long-haired girl in the shape of a "person" stands in front of a large wooden board, with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" written in black ink on the board. Another board in front of her has her bank account, WeChat and Alipay account, etc.
The picture caused controversy after being posted online.
Some netizens believe that this is a "eye-catching beggar behavior," while many others express sympathy for this.
"We discovered the situation around 10 o'clock in the morning when we were patrolling near the square, and there were already many onlookers at the time."
"The police officers from the Tianshui police station near the incident told local media that there were two girls, both around 20 years old, dressed beautifully in their youth."
"One of the girls crying and asking bystanders to play the game as a "human target," while the other was shouting on the side, saying that her friend's sister was suffering from leukemia and urgently needed surgery, asking everyone to help."
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's treatment of leukemia."
"Last night, the publicity officer of the Xiaocheng Branch of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told a reporter from the Xinjing Daily that the girl's name was Ji Jiali and she was raising funds for her sister Ji Jiayan."
But as treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan, they couldn't think of a good way to raise funds, so they did this act.
He said that throughout the process, two girls were present, one as the target and one to assist, but neither participated. During the whole process, no one was found to have shot the arrow, just some onlookers who took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police identified that the used bow and arrow were not subject to regulation.
The responsible person stated, "This way of attracting attention for fundraising is not encouraged."
After being warned by the police at the police station, she has left the station.
