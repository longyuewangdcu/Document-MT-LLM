"CreditEase advocates rational consumption on the eve of Double Twelve - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website"
"The total amount of national online payment transactions during this year's Double Eleven shopping frenzy reached 177 billion yuan, a new high compared to previous years."
"The various discount coupons and eye-catching live streaming sessions with product promotions have once again made consumers feel they are benefiting, while the consumer frenzy has on one hand made people marvel at the increasing strength of national consumption, but on the other hand has forced people to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and contemporary mainstream consumer groups."
"On the eve of Double Twelve, CreditEase Consumer Finance Co. (hereinafter referred to as "CreditEase") launched an advocacy for rational consumption, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish a good sense of consumption and consumer habits and reject blind consumption and excessive consumption."
"According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019."
"In general, residents in our country have good performance in terms of financial consumption, but there is a significant difference in financial behavior and skills, and there is a need to further enhance the level of basic financial knowledge. 
Elderly people and teenagers have relatively low financial literacy levels, and the "one elderly and one young" will continue to be a key focus of financial education. The "China Young Debt Status Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumer Report" released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption is an important way of consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole is showing a trend of rational consumption, which is different from the "excessive spending" label attached by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-the-trend consumption behavior, which has resulted in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to an increase in social problems. Financial companies should take on social responsibility and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, CreditEase has always been committed to helping people build their happy life with high-quality and considerate services. It advocates for consumers to establish a good and correct consumption view, and actively responds to regulatory calls, taking practical actions to enhance consumer's rational consumption awareness, especially among the young.
In recent years, CreditEase has carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities targeting young groups including college students. It has also used various forms such as innovation practices competition in cooperation with top universities in China to subtly guide the consumption needs of young people, helping them establish a rational consumption view, plan their consumption needs reasonably, and accumulate wealth for their life.
With the arrival of Double Twelve, CreditEase reminds all consumer friends to establish a rational consumption awareness and a correct money view, resist blind consumption and overconsumption, avoid consumer loan pitfalls, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life."
"Consumers must plan ahead when consuming and repay on time according to their ability."
"If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying a car or buying a house."
"At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, consumers should also choose regular institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have operating qualifications."
"In the future, Jiexin will continue to bring consumers more customized and diversified services through its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products, continuously helping the public improve their financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming a lifelong trustworthy consumer finance partner for consumers."
