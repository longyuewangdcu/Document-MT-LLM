"Vietnam People's Daily - The Gulf Cooperation Council Responding to Common Challenges"
"The stay of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia includes Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait."
"It is worth noting that this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since the Gulf diplomatic crisis in mid-2017, when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar."
"In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism and having close ties with Iran."
"The diplomatic tension seriously impacted the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and had a negative impact on the economy of the countries in the region."
Four Arab countries blocked the land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement, mediated by the United States and Kuwait, towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making efforts to restore their relationship with Qatar by first appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The resolution of the differences among the Gulf Arab countries to restore their relationship with Qatar stems from the need to unite for the interests and stability of all countries and to address common challenges.
During the visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighboring countries.
The 725 km long route connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for travel and integration of supply chains for citizens of both countries.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman and 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion were signed by the businesses of both countries.
The visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations on the Iran nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which the Gulf Arab states criticized for failing to address Iran's missile issue.
The Gulf states have long considered Iran a "competitor" and its nuclear program a "threat" to regional security.
Gulf states believe that failing to address the Iranian missile issue and take action to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
In the context of the negotiations between the major powers and Iran's nuclear talks failing to meet the expectations of the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia directly negotiated with Iran.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tension in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows down the growth of the economy of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf summit will be the first summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries since the resolution of disputes between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of unity and to propose measures to enhance cooperation among its member countries to address common challenges and contribute to stability and development in the Gulf region.
