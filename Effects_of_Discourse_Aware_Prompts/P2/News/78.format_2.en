Resonate the University Spirit with the Times Spirit - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational ideas and value pursuits that have been accumulated in the development process of a university, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the university spirit has been of utmost importance for the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shoulder a unique mission different from other social organizations. For China's universities, they emerged in a critical moment for the nation and their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "cultivating morality and benefiting the world, rectifying order and promoting peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "revitalizing learning and strengthening the country".
Currently, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, and the global competition in education, technology, and talent is intensifying. Higher education, as an important "supply-side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reforms.
The proposal of "Overall Plan for the Construction of World-Class Universities and Disciplines" particularly shows not only the confidence and determination of China's progress from a high education country to a strong one, but also puts forward higher and more updated requirements for university development.
How to make efforts to join the ranks of world-class universities in a shorter period of time, while still having certain gaps, and to accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines to achieve "overtaking on a bend"?
In addition to having a firm goal confidence, path confidence, and capability confidence, universities should also fully utilize three advantages: first, the advantage of being a latecomer, through continuous introduction of outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to significantly improve academic level and quality of management; second, the advantage of culture, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years, promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, to consolidate strength, shape brand, and enhance image; third, the advantage of the system, exerting the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-oriented drive, gathering consensus, optimizing resource allocation, providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for universities to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
It is especially important to recognize that building world-class universities cannot be identical, and each university must showcase its individuality and uniqueness while showcasing its strengths.
School features should reflect both commonality with Chinese characteristics and each school's unique target orientation, educational tradition, and resource endowment.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we focus on three distinctive aspects in our education: (1) We emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents by building an integrated education environment that combines science, technology and business, forming a complete entrepreneurial education ecosystem. (2) We highlight the convergence of interdisciplinary subjects by promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system and creating an institutional environment for interdisciplinary subjects, actively cultivating new interdisciplinary subjects and iconic interdisciplinary achievements. (3) We highlight the characteristic of the educational system and social service by conducting in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a Zhejiang University-industry-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university, making the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking truth and innovation", the common values of "diligence, morality, wisdom, and practicality," and the common expression of the Zhejiang spirit of "embracing rivers and oceans, igniting sincerity and virtue, promoting the advancement of civilization and the prosperity of the nation" have formed the latest expression system of Zhejiang spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to persist in the correct direction of education, constantly accumulate cultural height, and consolidate spiritual strength. It has rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Embracing rivers and oceans" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the vision of "using talents from all over the world." It represents the pursuit of quality education concepts from world-renowned schools. "Igniting sincerity and virtue" emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and benevolence, referring to the university's cultivation of morality and character while pursuing truth. "Promoting the advancement of civilization" reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of new knowledge and research innovation, as well as reform and development, and innovation through change. "Prosperity of the nation" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that the university should always share the same honor and disgrace as the nation's destiny.
"This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education."
"The wise hear it in the silent, the bright see it in the formless."
"Chinese universities should further rely on the overall situation of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, deeply understand the historical mission of higher education in this era, and speed up the construction of world-class universities."
"At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence, let the spirit of the university stimulate the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation, and provide a continuous driving force for the realization of national prosperity, national revival, and the common ideal of mankind."
