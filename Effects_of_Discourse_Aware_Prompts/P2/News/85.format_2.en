To enhance university students' entrepreneurial and innovative abilities, departments such as education and human resources in Guangxi have worked together to build entrepreneurial platforms, establish more practical teaching bases for university students outside of school, university technology parks, university entrepreneurial parks, and incubation bases, providing external support for university students' entrepreneurship.
According to requirements, by 2020, all universities' innovation and entrepreneurship practical bases must have an area of at least 3000 square meters for undergraduate schools and 2000 square meters for vocational schools.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and prioritizes supporting students who perform well in innovation and entrepreneurship practices to switch majors.
College teachers are required to work in industry enterprises for at least two months every two years, in order to improve their awareness and ability in innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Autonomous Region Education Office requires Guangxi universities to deeply implement university students' innovation and entrepreneurship training plans, striving to make every university student participate in an innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their school years.
Universities should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels, and provide financial support.
