This is exactly what Song Fu and others wanted to ask, but someone beat them to it. You look at me, I look at you, they don't know what's going on, where they can answer.
Miao Yi immediately flew to the place where the loud noise came from, and Yan Xiu's three people immediately followed.
Song Fu and others looked at each other and followed to take a look.
When everyone arrived at the entrance of the mountain gate, they saw that under the moonlight, the stone carving billboard with the three characters "Dong Lai Cave" was already broken, which shocked everyone. Someone had destroyed the mountain gate of Dong Lai Cave.
Miao Yi turned around abruptly and looked at Song Fu and others with a fierce look, sneering and saying, "Good!"
"I just arrived today, it seems that someone can't wait to give me a lesson!"
"Very good!"
Song Fu and others were stunned. They understood what the other person meant, but this was definitely not done by them. They were just sitting together having a small gathering and discussing how to give Miao Yi a lesson in the future, and they only came out after hearing the unusual noise.
At first, several people still suspected that Miao Yi and others did it, but seeing Miao Yi's appearance, they felt that Miao Yi did not need to destroy his own mountain gate to show himself a lesson, after all, Miao Yi is the owner of Dong Lai Cave. Just taking office and being destroyed by someone is a disgraceful thing.
This kind of thing must be made clear, otherwise, once it is poked, they cannot bear the responsibility. Song Fu respectfully saluted and said, "Cave owner, this is definitely not what we have done!"
Several other people also raised their fists to guarantee, it seems like it was the first time to treat Miao Yi as the Cave Master seriously.
"Sly argument!"
Miao Yi fixed his gaze on Song Fuyi and spoke in a loud voice, "I just appointed you to guard the mountain gate today, and you wouldn't know if someone destroyed the mountain gate?"
"Is it not that you intentionally let the water out?"
"This..."
Song Fuyi hesitated in his speech, he wasn't even here, and now it's not good to say that I didn't take you, the Cave Master, seriously, so I wasn't here, he could only raise his fist and honestly explain, "The Cave Master may not have known the situation when he just arrived, the miscellaneous errand from Donglai City has not yet been sent, I have to handle food and drink by myself, for the sake of my stomach, I temporarily left, I didn't expect this to happen."
Wang Zifa and others also raised their fists one by one to prove, "Cave Master, we can prove that Song Fuyi, the senior brother, was just having a meal with us."
Miao Yi pointed to the fallen archway and shouted loudly, "Is it that it fell down by itself? Don't tell me it was blown down by the wind!"
Song Fuyi was a little dumbfounded and had no choice but to raise his hand, "Cave Master, I can swear to my Blue Jade Gate ancestors, this is not what we did, if there is half a false statement, let Song Fuyi have a bad death!"
Miao Yi looked at everyone with flashing eyes, his voice was cold, "Is someone coming to my East Arrival Cave to cause trouble?"
Everyone was shocked and quickly looked around.
"What are you all still waiting for here? Do you want to be strangled in your sleep?"
"Hurry up and start searching!"
Miao Yi shouted.
Yan Xiu and the other two bowed and quickly spread out into the surrounding mountains and forests.
"Hmm?"
Miao Yi sniffed heavily and looked at Song Fu and the others, as if questioning them. Why aren't you searching if it wasn't done by you? Do you know something?
At this time, you have to prove that you have nothing to do with yourself and others. Song Fu immediately turned left and right and shouted, "Hurry up and follow the command of the cave master to search!"
Everyone bowed to Miao Yi and immediately spread out.
However, Song Fu was called by Miao Yi, "Song Fu, come with me!"
Song Fu hesitated, then bowed and said that he followed Miao Yi.
After everyone left, a shadow like that of a person in water appeared at the original place, and it was none other than the old white figure of unparalleled style.
The old white was staring at the fallen stone monument, slightly shaking his head and laughing lightly: "The world is like chess, how can hot-blooded men only have the bravery of a horseman!"
"I have always been worried that your nature is too kind, and you are easily taken advantage of... It is skillful for a man to be rampant, but it is difficult for a rough man to ascend to heaven, and now I am relieved."
After speaking, the entire shadow swayed like water, and disappeared quietly and without a trace in the swaying.
Donglai Hall's candles flickered, and Song Fu followed Miao Yi, standing one in front and one behind in the hall, and outside, the charcoal had stood up, as if he had noticed something and sneezed.
Miao Yi stared expressionlessly at his throne, with his back to Song Fu, without a word.
The atmosphere between the two was a bit oppressive, and Song Fu waited for a while, finally unable to help asking, "What did the Cave Master call me for?"
Miao Yi said in a gloomy voice, "Song Fu, do you know your crime?"
Song Fu's mouth twitched with irony, and he glanced at the short table next to him, with a calm expression: "This matter is not what I and others did, what crime does Song Fu have?"
"That's not what I asked for!"
Miao Yi suddenly turned around and stared at him, coldly asking word by word, "I ordered you to guard the mountain gate, why did you leave your post? Don't tell me you don't take my command as the master of this cave seriously!"
Song Fu thought to himself, what do you think?
I never took it seriously to begin with.
Of course, he wouldn't say that out loud and replied, "Song Fu has already reported to the master of the cave, it's really helpless, I just left temporarily for some food, I didn't want this to happen."
Miao Yi asked, "Do you think the master of the mansion and the master of the mountain will believe your explanation if I report this?"
Song Fu smiled and said, "People have two faces, if the master of the cave wants to frame Song Fu, then go ahead, but the master of the cave shouldn't forget, I also have a mouth to defend myself, I'm not a mute."
Miao Yi chuckled and said, "It seems you really don't regret it!"
With these words, Yan Xiu, Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shao appeared outside the door together, bowing to Miao Yi, "Master of the cave, we haven't found any suspicious people yet."
Miao Yi said, "The suspicious person is right in front of us, how can we not find them!"
It seemed like Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun received a secret signal and quickly closed the palace gates.
Song Fu was shocked when he heard the noise and quickly turned around, only to see Yan Xiu's pair of hatchets with a deadly aura coming at him.
Song Fu quickly drew his sword and a cold light emerged from its sheath, trying to block Yan Xiu's attack.
Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun also raised their guns almost instantly, attacking Song Fu together.
Yan Xiu and Song Fu's martial arts were similar, they were evenly matched, but with the addition of Dan Biaoyi and Qiu Shaoqun's attack, Song Fu's situation became dangerous.
"Shameless thief!"
"How dare you plot against..."
Surrounded and unable to escape, Song Fu waved his sword and fought desperately with Yan Xiu. Before he could finish his bitter and angry roar, he was pierced by two guns that broke through his magical defense and pierced deeply into his chest.
Song Fu opened his eyes wide and tried to turn his head to look at Miao Yi, stammering with his lips and his anger could not be described in his eyes.
He finally realized that this was a trap. The collapse of the mountain gate plaque was not only aimed at framing him, but also removing his fellow disciples so that he would not be able to unite with them to resist. The main purpose was to take his life.
