"What are you doing?! "
The old master of Donggong knocked on the cane in his hand, and his voice was angry.
"Our ancestors will arrive soon. Please calm down, Donggong Old Master, you will know what to do later." The leading man replied.
The old master of Donggong naturally knows who the "ancestors" he mentioned refers to.
He was a bit at a loss and didn't know why Pei Yi came.
It's really not a good thing to have a festival with DK. Although everyone in R country wants to drive DK out,
it's just an empty fantasy.
After a few minutes, Pei Yi's car arrived.
He got out of the car and shifted his gaze to the car not far away.
Anxia Nong saw him, and did not take off his mask and wig, and got out of the car.
Wu Lianzhi followed closely behind.
"You're here," said An Xiaoning.
Pei Yi glanced at her, rarely smiling, and walked to her, getting closer to her, lowering his voice and said, "Hey, by looking at your appearance, it's hard for this group of people to guess that you are you, right?"
"Of course, I don't want them to know my identity, so I asked you to come. Now is not the time,"
Pei Yi unconsciously glanced at Wu Lianzhi, "How did you get together with him?"
"Something,"
he stood straight, turned around, and faced the people of the East Palace family with a faint smile on his face, "I don't know where my sister offended you people of the East Palace family, but you actually wanted to kill her?"
"Has your courage grown to the top of your head?"
The people of the East Palace family heard this, their faces changed instantly, Pei Yi's sister?
Where did Pei Yi come from with a sister?
The old woman of the East Palace spoke out, "Mr. Pei's younger sister... we really don't know anything about her."
"It's easy to say you don't know, now I'm telling you,"
Pei Yi said coldly, "Did you hear that clearly?"
"Since Mr. Pei says this is your cousin, just take your cousin away. As for Dong Gong Lianzhi, his name is still in my family's genealogy and he has not been disowned as a descendant. He is still a member of my Dong Gong family, and it is up to us Dong Gong family to decide how to deal with him."
Before Pei Yi could answer, An Xiaoning saw an opportunity to act and called out to him, "Big brother, he is my boyfriend. I have his flesh and blood in my belly now. You can't just abandon him."
Pei Yi originally only wanted to take her away, but now it's a bit tricky.
However, his style of being rough and domineering is still the same. As long as he wants to do something, this is nothing. 
"Old granny, you heard it too. This person... he is also my younger brother-in-law. They both have children, and if you hand him over, wouldn't the children be fatherless in the future?"
"Do you think I'll agree?"
The old woman of the East Palace is very clear that if she hands the man over to Pei Yi, then they will not be able to handle their own grandson in a fair and open manner in the future. Therefore, although she is wary of DK's power, her attitude cannot be weakened.
"Mr. Pei, this may not be possible. Our family has its own laws and outsiders are not allowed to interfere in the disposal of our family members," said Mr. Wu.
"They say he is the father of my sister's child. Are your ears not working well because you're getting old?"
Pei shifted his gaze to Wu and asked, "Are you from the Donggong family?"
"This morning, when my mother gave me poisonous food, I immediately severed my mother-daughter relationship with her. Before that, when someone from the Donggong family tried to design me, Miss An, and his subordinates to die in an accident, I already knew clearly. Although the name Lianzhi still appears on the Donggong family genealogy and household registration, I am no longer a Donggong. I am now a Wu and Lianzhi is my current name. I am no longer a member of the Donggong family!"
Each word was powerful and full of coldness.
Speaking out in public in front of so many people shows his determination.
"That's not what you say counts!" said the old lady of the Donggong family. "Those who are born into our Donggong family are our family members, and those who die are our family's ghosts!"
"Then, old lady of the Donggong family, I want to ask you, now that Miss An knows about your plot to murder her, are you not worried about a serious intervention from the side of country S when you are here to punish and dispose of me?"
This was said by Lianzhi Wu, with a rough tone and no fear.
"I have had dealings with Miss An," Pei smiled slightly. "She is the type of person who will take revenge for grudges. Do you think she will let you have her life quietly?"
"Alright, enough of the chitchat, I value my time, I'll take both of these people with me."
The person from Donggong family was about to speak again and he added, "if you don't want to see any bloodshed here."
And just like that, the person from Donggong family watched as the already cooked duck flew away completely.
The old lady and the grandfather from Donggong were really angry.
Finally, the old lady from Donggong directly spoke, "Forget it, forget it, strike his name and cancel his household registration."
"We have to return to country S."
Pei Yixue gave her a sideways glance, "Leave after using it?"
"You didn't say you would agree to my request, you said you were going home?"
"I am in a hurry to go home because I have something to do, but I did promise you a request, so what is it?"
"Well, my request might make you feel a little awkward..."
"Well, let's not mention it then. Let's talk about something that won't make me feel uncomfortable,"
Pei Yixue leaned over, staring at her intently, "You haven't changed a bit. Accompany me for half a month."
"What kind of accompaniment?"
"Just like before,"
An Xiaonong looked at him, "No, first, I can't be on a leash, I can't restrict my freedom, and second, half a month is too long, two days are enough."
"..." Pei Yixue's smile faded slightly, "You're cutting the price too much, five days, not less. You said that others could make requests, and when they do, you can't be untrustworthy. I'm sure I'll give you your freedom."
"Can I go back home first?"
"No."
Wu Lianzhi listened to the conversation between the two, and indeed felt that these two people might have something going on.
Could these two people have an unclear relationship?
It sounds like it, 
but if it's true, then those two people were too blatant in front of him.
"Let him go back to S Country first, and I'll be by myself in your place, okay?"
"I won't treat you guys any differently, let's go together." His words were undeniable.
An Xiaoning no longer said anything.
Since they were not far from Qingping Mountain, they arrived soon.
Coming to this place again, there were really mixed feelings.
When Qin Guo saw her, he was really unhappy in his heart. When they entered, she immediately rolled her eyes.
She thought that her ancestors brought back this pest again.
