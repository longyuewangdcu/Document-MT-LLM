More than 130 Asian-American groups in the US submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice
on May 23, protesting against the discrimination of Asian-American applicants by three Ivy League schools, Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, in the admission process.
The Asian-American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of American colleges and universities has doubled in the past 10 years, but in these three American schools, the proportion of Asian-Americans has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these schools have been "systematically and persistently" discriminating against Asian-American applicants in their so-called "holistic consideration" admission process.
Zhao Yukong introduced that research by scholars such as Sander in 2014 showed that among these three universities, Asian-Americans have the lowest admission rate relative to the number of applicants among all ethnic groups.
Data from the US Department of Education also showed that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, while Yale University and Brown University have effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua reporters that they expect the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to launch an investigation after submitting their complaint and to take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans after determining the facts.
They also hope that the universities being complained about will actively pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities being complained about have not responded.
The Asian American Coalition for Education (AACE) was founded in 2015, and at that time, it had complained about Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to American Chinese groups, this time's participants in the complaint also include American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational organizations.
