"Don't be intimidated at the starting line -
when visiting the Xinhua Book Fair, one often feels the popularity of self-help and success books.
Many of the success books promoted today advocate the "best principle" - that is, first assuming or implying that you can "do it", and then telling you what you need to do.
This means that the most important and fundamental part of "how to do it" has been skipped.
That is why these books have one common feature - either you do your best, or don't do anything at all; either 100% or 0%; either you reach the top of Mount Tai, or just stay where you are."
"This "best principle" is universally recognized as "correct" by everyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "painful determination, redefining oneself, and making a 180-degree transformation," which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to traditions, resist change, and reject change, it is a self-deception and a futile effort to shout "you need to change" in their ear.
Most people will show weakness in front of the word "transformation" and hesitate to take action; or with a sudden impulse, they make the determination to "transform" and take the first step bravely, but often it doesn't last long, and they fail to persist.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "From Tomorrow On" perfectly embodies this "universal human nature" in a vivid way."
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limit of ordinary people, leaving the vast majority of people feeling discouraged.
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that more ordinary people can take the road to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small wins for a big win," meaning that if you can't do 100, only doing 1 is fine: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, only climbing the small sand dune in front of your house is fine, because that is always stronger than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people sticking to it has increased, and as long as you persist, the probability of success will also increase.
However, the success road of following the "second-best principle" is slightly longer.
In general, although the "best principle" on the surface claims to make everyone successful, it actually only motivates a few people in the end. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" effectively motivates more people and benefits as many people as possible.
