"The resource reserve of naked carps in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhua News Agency."
The latest monitoring results show that the amount of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year compared to last year, reaching 10.85 thousand tons, which is more than 40 times the amount in 2002 when protection began.
Naked carp, also known as "Yuan fish," is a precious species of fish in Qinghai Lake and plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological chain of "water-fish-bird" in the Qinghai Lake watershed and preserving biodiversity.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as excessive human killing and the degradation of the naked carp breeding environment, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake rapidly declined, and the amount of naked carp resources in 2002 was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as a endangered species in the "Red List of China's Species."
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on lake and fish conservation and prohibits any unit, collective, and individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and tributaries.
At the same time, it is forbidden to sell naked carp and its products. Meanwhile, through measures such as artificial propagation and release, cleaning up the main rivers that flow into Qinghai Lake, and designing scientifically reasonable "fish passage", the protection of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has continued to increase.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director of the Qinghai Province Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department, introduced that, as of now, nearly 180 million naked carp have been artificially propagated and released in Qinghai Lake, and the contribution rate to the restoration of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has exceeded 23%.
The Three Rivers Source area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Tibetan Plateau, this year, Qinghai has successively issued announcements banning fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive ban on fishing management system for "one river, one river, and one lake."
