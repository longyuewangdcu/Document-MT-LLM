Vice Director of the China National Supply and Marketing Cooperation General Association, Hou Shunli, and Vice Director of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, launched a grand promotion at the opening ceremony: The source of Hunan Red is in Xinghua, and the rise of red tea injects new momentum into the "Five-Color Hunan Tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of a hundred billion Hunan tea industry, forming a development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, and Five-Color Tea".
The tea industry in the province is increasing its innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns in taking the lead. The main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, which will drive the income of tea farmers.
The wind of change is blowing, and red tea is gaining strength once again.
Tea industry experts in the province say that by harvesting green tea, black tea, and red tea, tea farmers have income all year round and the value of tea gardens is steadily increasing.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises that have been granted the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark.
Newhua was thrilled to be the origin of "Hunan Red Tea." In the Newhua Red Tea Pavilion, a Fujian tea merchant was interested in a high mountain tea called "Bingli Chun" and immediately placed an order.
Secretary-General Wang Zhung of the Provincial Tea Association happily said that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
The red of Xianhua Red Tea infuses the cultural connotation of tea, is popular and has a hot trade, and the tea industry in Hunan welcomes a new spring.
