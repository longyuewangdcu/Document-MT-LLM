The Chongqing Vocational School is piloting the modern apprenticeship system. Upon enrollment, students are considered as provisional employees of the company.
The city's education commission has received information that starting this year, 60 vocational schools in the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship system" for talent training. Students who are accepted for the pilot training will have both the identity of apprentices and be pre-recorded as employees of the participating enterprises after admission.
The city education commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of vocational school students and enterprise provisional employees be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, schools, and enterprises will sign a three-party agreement. For apprentices who are not yet 18 years old but have reached the age of 16, a four-party agreement between the apprentices, guardians, schools, and enterprises must be signed to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific position, teaching content, and rights protection of the apprentices in on-the-job training.
Encouraging pilot schools to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and cooperate with partner enterprises to carry out pre-employment training and retraining for employees.
Pilot schools should reform their talent training mode.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent cultivation plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training system as a pilot cycle, the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the talent cultivation plan, and the on-the-job internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise group management mode should be implemented, and according to the characteristics of different professions, one mentor can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city determined 60 city-level vocational modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, each pilot program with about 50 people, and a total of about 3000 students (apprentices) were trained.
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then promoting, exploring the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education between schools and enterprises, effectively improving students' job skills, and enhancing students' employment rate and employment quality.
