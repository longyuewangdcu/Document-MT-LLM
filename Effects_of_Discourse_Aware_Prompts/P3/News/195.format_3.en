"Curators from China and Saudi Arabia jointly organize Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennial exhibition - Xinhua News Agency."
The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial, opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District located in the northwest of the capital city, Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China, among other places, are participating in the biennial,
which is jointly planned by the Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Yuz Museum in China, with Fei Yu, the director of the UCCA Yuz Museum, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennial, "Feeling the Stones Across the River," is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the social and economic transition period and reflects the current situation of cultural and social development in Saudi Arabia.
The biennial covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, spanning across six interconnected buildings, which are presented in six units: "Feeling the Stones Across the River," "Heritage as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Towards the Public," "A Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Of the exhibits, works from 27 Saudi Arabian artists make up over 40% of the total, encompassing various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. Works from 12 Chinese artists are also receiving attention. Some artists use recycled materials in innovative ways in their works, for example, Xu Bing in his "Endless Landscape Behind the Story" (2014) series reconstructed a classic landscape painting using waste materials.
Bakr Ali, CEO of the Diryab Biennial Foundation, stated that he hopes this biennial will establish international dialogue and allow a global audience to understand the thriving cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, while strengthening their interactions.
Fei Fei said, "The goal of the biennial is twofold: to allow Saudi Arabian contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to allow Saudi Arabian audiences to integrate into the world of contemporary art."
During the biennial's opening period, a series of lectures will also be held where artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.
