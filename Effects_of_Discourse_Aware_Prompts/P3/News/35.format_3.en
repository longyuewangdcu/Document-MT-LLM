Education Comment: What is needed to save abducted children?
If we analogize the famous public welfare slogan "no trade means no killing," then in a good environment where there is no demand for "kidnapping," community prevention and control, and the whole society's anti-kidnapping efforts can make kidnapping acts unprofitable, high-risk, and high-cost, and such crimes will no longer repeatedly occur.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched a child missing information emergency release platform developed by the anti-kidnapping office.
This is an internet information platform established to create an authoritative channel for the release of child missing information and to promptly retrieve abducted children.
I heard that the app is called "Reunion," and I feel a warm feeling.
The new technology means not only the name "artistic" and full of feelings, but also the proper use of information technology, which is practical and effective.
The enforcement of anti-kidnapping is primarily aimed at finding the abducted children and protecting their personal safety and freedom.
Secondly, it is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
There are many "big words" that can be listed from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education in the meaning of criminal punishment.
However, before the kidnapping case is solved, the personal safety of the victims should be given priority.
The priority of the matter should be considered, and in the urgency of the "rescue" objective, topics such as "whether children who have been kidnapped should be sentenced to death without exception" which have widespread opinions and debates, can be temporarily put aside and discussed cautiously. However, rescuing kidnapped children cannot be delayed.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers usually leave the crime scene as soon as they succeed.
If the search for the kidnapped children is delayed for even a minute, the children may move further away from their parents and the difficulty of cracking the case will increase.
In this situation, taking effective measures directly to help crack the case and find the children, such as the "reunification" platform, is indeed a practical action.
After all, "fighting against child trafficking" is a major task that requires the whole legal system to work together.
Combating crime, protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, requires the implementation of "caring for the young and helping the weak" from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of law enforcement.
Additionally, the prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family to society.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rests at a train station, the parents sleep deeply, only to find that the child is gone when they wake up.
We can't expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-defense skills, but as parents of young children, they should at least have a sufficient sense of protection.
Taking turns to rest or placing the child in a secure protective environment are the minimum measures to prevent child abduction.
On the other hand, the buyers of abducted children should also be attended to and punished.
Individual illegal acts are often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of China's Criminal Law, the statutory punishment for the crime of child trafficking starts from 5 years imprisonment. In cases with particularly serious circumstances, it can reach the death penalty and confiscation of property.
With a high starting point for punishment and the heaviest possible penalty, under the trend of leniency, the crime of child trafficking clearly belongs to offenses with heavier penalties.
Yet, every year, there are still many cases of child trafficking occurring.
It can be seen that some people have a backward concept and weak legal awareness in terms of raising children.
Legal education for these people should be followed up.
To effectively control child trafficking crimes, it cannot be relied solely on strict official enforcement.
If the market for buying and selling abducted children widely exists, the traffickers are greedy and constantly innovate their trafficking methods, forming a situation of "fighting the law" with law enforcement, and anti-trafficking actions will inevitably become inefficient.
Therefore, abolishing backward concepts, popularizing legal knowledge, and helping to root out child trafficking and purchasing crimes are also beneficial.
