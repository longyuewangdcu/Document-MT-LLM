"Girl acts as a target to raise funds for her sister: "It's just a flesh wound" - Xinhua News Agency."
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou's Wulin Square, with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a girl in Hangzhou willing to be a "target for archery" to raise funds for her sister went viral on social media.
The photo showed the girl standing in front of a slightly higher wooden board, with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" indicating that people can use a bow and arrow after paying.
The act has sparked heated discussion among netizens.
Last night, the spokesperson of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xiaocheng Branch confirmed to a reporter from the Xinjing News that the police confirmed that the girl made such an extreme move for her sister's fundraising, but this behavior is not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The girl's street "arrow target" fundraising was warned and went viral.
In the circulating photos, a long-haired girl standing in the shape of a "person" in front of a large wooden board with the words "human target, ten yuan per arrow" written in black ink. Another wooden board in front of her has her bank account, WeChat and Alipay accounts, etc.
The photo caused controversy after being posted online.
Some netizens consider this to be a "gimmick for begging for attention," while others express sympathy.
"We discovered the situation around 10 am on the 23rd while patrolling near the square, and at that time there were already quite a few onlookers,"
said the police officers from Tianshui Police Station near the incident site, in an interview with local media. They stated that there were two girls vending, both around 20 years old and dressed youthfully.
One of the girls, who was crying, was doing the "human target" fundraising and asking passerby to play the game. The other girl was standing by and shouting to attract attention, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery fees and asking for help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was fundraising for her sister's leukemia treatment."
The spokesperson from the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's Xicheng Branch confirmed to reporters from Xinjing Daily last night that the girl's name was Jia Li, and she was fundraising for her sister Jia Yan.
However, due to the need for more than 300,000 yuan for the treatment, she was unable to find a good way to raise funds, so she resorted to this action.
He said that during the whole process, one girl was the target and the other was responsible for assisting, but they did not participate. No one was found shooting during the process, just onlookers taking pictures and posting them on Weibo.
After the police confirmed with the security department, the bow and arrow used did not fall under the controlled category.
The responsible person stated that "this method of attracting attention to raise funds is not encouraged".
After being warned by the police, she has left the police station.
