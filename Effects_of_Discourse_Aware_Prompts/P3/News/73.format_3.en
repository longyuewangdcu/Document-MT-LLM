Joint credit advocates rational consumption ahead of "Double 12" - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website.
The total amount of national online payment business transactions during this year's "Double 11" shopping festival reached 177 billion yuan, setting a new record compared to previous years.
The numerous discounts and eye-catching live broadcast sales once again made consumers excited, this consumption trend on one hand reflects the increasingly strong consumption power of the people, on the other hand, it also forces us to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the current mainstream consumption group.
Ahead of the arrival of "Double 12", Joint Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Joint Credit") has launched an advocacy for rational consumption, reminding users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
In general, the performance of residents in China in terms of financial consumption is good, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills that need to be further improved.
The financial literacy of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will still be the focus of sustained attention in financial education. Nielsen's "Report on the Debt Status of Young People in China" and China Central Television's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption is an important means of consumption upgrading. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a trend of rational consumption, which is different from the label of "over-extravagance" from the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behavior, resulting in excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even leading to increasing social problems. Financial enterprises should take the initiative to take on social responsibilities and carry out positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jiexin has always been dedicated to helping the people build their happy lives with high-quality and intimate services, advocating consumers to establish good and correct consumption attitudes, and actively responding to regulatory calls, to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, through practical actions.
In the past few years, Jiexin has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for the youth population, including college students, and has subtly influenced the consumption needs of young people through various forms of cooperation with top domestic universities and innovation and practice competitions. Helping to establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan consumption needs, and help accumulate life wealth for them.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jiexin reminds...
It's important to plan ahead when spending and to spend within your means and make timely repayments.
If there is a delay, the late record will be recorded in your personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future activities such as buying a car or a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose reputable institutions and channels, and be aware of checking the relevant institutions' qualifications to operate.
In the future, Jiexin will continue to bring consumers more need-based and diverse services with its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products. It will continuously help the public enhance their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the idea of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a reliable partner for consumers' lifetime consumption finance.
