Vietnam People's Network - The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) stopovers in response to common challenges by
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
Notably, this marks the Crown Prince's first visit to Qatar since the mid-2017 implementation of a blockade by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies on Qatar, resulting in a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
During this crisis, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive blockade, accusing it of supporting terrorism and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions severely impacted the unity within the GCC and had a negative effect on the economies of the regional nations.
The four Arab nations blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council summit in January, where the Gulf nations signed an agreement facilitated by the US and Kuwait towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore their relationships with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The resolution of differences by the Gulf Arab nations to restore relationships with Qatar stems from the requirement to unite for the interests of each nation and regional stability and to address common challenges.
During the visit of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighboring countries.
The 725 km long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' enterprises signed 13 cooperation memorandums worth $30 billion.
The Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and major world countries to save the Iran nuclear agreement, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which had been criticized by Gulf Arab countries as unable to resolve the Iranian missile issue.
The Gulf Arab countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and view its nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that not addressing the Iranian missile issue and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region is inadequate.
Against the background of the failure of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran to meet the desires of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia conducted direct negotiations with Iran.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the end of the disputes between some of its members and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic achievements in promoting the restoration of unity within the council and propose measures for its member countries to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to stability and development in the Gulf region.
