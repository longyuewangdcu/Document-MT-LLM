The Guangxi University Student Suspension and Entrepreneurship Year Limit Can Reach up to 5 Years -
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 19th Special Telegram (Reporter Zhang Ying) - Recently, the reporter learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Bureau that in the future, Guangxi's universities will implement flexible academic systems, relax the suspension limit for university students, and extend the suspension and entrepreneurship years for in-school students by 2 to 5 years on the basis of the original academic system. Suspension and entrepreneurship time can be considered as practical education time.
In order to promote the improvement of university students' entrepreneurship and innovation ability, the Guangxi Education, Human Resources and Social Security Departments, and other departments jointly build entrepreneurship platforms, build more university student off-campus practical teaching bases, university technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, entrepreneurship incubation bases, and provide external protection for university students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the innovation and entrepreneurship practical base areas of each university should be more than 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and more than 2,000 square meters for vocational schools.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and prioritizes supporting students who perform exceptionally well in innovation and entrepreneurship practices to switch majors.
College teachers must spend at least two months every two years interning at industrial enterprises to improve their awareness and ability in innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Autonomous Region Education Department requires all colleges in Guangxi to deeply implement the innovation and entrepreneurship training plan for college students, striving to ensure that every college student participates in an innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their school years.
Colleges should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels and provide financial support.
