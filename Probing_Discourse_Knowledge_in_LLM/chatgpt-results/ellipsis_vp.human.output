The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я хирург, а не фанатка. Да ладно. Я знаю, ты хочешь увидеть, как я играю. Хочу, да.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. Here's a breakdown of the translation:"Я хирург, а не фанатка." - This translates to "I am a surgeon, not a groupie." It accurately conveys the meaning of the first sentence in the English text."Да ладно." - This is an interjection that can be translated to "Oh come on." It conveys the speaker's attitude of mild disbelief or exasperation, and is an appropriate translation of the second sentence in the English text."Я знаю, ты хочешь увидеть, как я играю." - This translates to "I know you want to see me play." It accurately conveys the meaning of the third sentence in the English text."Хочу, да." - This translates to "I do, actually." It accurately conveys the speaker's affirmation of the desire to be seen playing.None of the other translations accurately capture the meaning of the original English sentence, and some of them introduce new meanings that are not present in the original text. Therefore, the correct translation is the first one.
The correct Russian translation is: "Потому, что изначально, для открытия сейфа нужны были два ключа. У Суда все еще есть один из них, а второй считался потерянным. Пока я его не нашел. Вы имеете в виду, мы нашли."This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is saying that the safe originally required two keys to open it, one of which was still in the possession of the court while the second key was thought to be lost. However, the speaker found the second key, and the listener is clarifying that it was actually "we" (the speaker and the listener) who found it, not just the speaker alone. The word "нашли" (found) accurately reflects the past tense of the verb "found" in the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Что? Ты только что назвала меня Робертом. Нет, не называла. Назвала.].This is because the English sentence is a dialogue between two people where one person accuses the other of calling them by the wrong name ("Robert"). The second person denies this accusation initially, but then admits to having called them by the wrong name.The Russian translation option [Что? Ты только что назвала меня Робертом. Нет, не называла. Назвала.] correctly captures the meaning of the original sentence, where the second person first denies calling the first person "Robert" and then admits to having done so. The other translation options do not accurately reflect the content of the original sentence and do not make sense in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:"Таков был твой план? Я просто увидел возможность получить расположение у Хана и воспользовался ею. Я почти погиб. Но ты нет, Марко, ты выжил."Out of the options given, this is not an exact match to any of them. The correct translation conveys the same meaning as the English sentence while maintaining correct grammar and syntax in Russian.Option 1 is mostly correct, but the phrase "оказать Хану услугу" (to do a favor for the Khan) is a better translation than "оказать Хану пользу" (to be of benefit to the Khan).Option 2 uses the wrong verb form for "you didn't" ("не сделал же" instead of "не погиб же").Option 3 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не захотел").Option 4 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не подумал").Option 5 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не занялся").Option 6 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не смог").Option 7 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не поступил").Option 8 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не помог").Option 9 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не понял").Option 10 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не сказал").
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Им повезет, если хоть кто-нибудь в этом департаменте поговорит с ними после той "заказухи" о чрезмерном применении силы полицией Нью-Йорка. Это был другой журналист. И я не знал, что ты читаешь "Таймс". Читаю.]This translates to: "They're lucky if anyone in this department talks to them after that hack job they did on excessive force in the NYPD. That was a different reporter. And I wasn't aware that you read The Times. I do."
The correct Russian translation is:[Через три месяца она бы вышла на УДО. Зачем бросать все это? Я не знаю. Но, спорим, Джоуи знает.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other translations contain different verbs that do not fit the context of the sentence or use incorrect grammar.
The correct translation is: "Да. Адалинда сказала ему? Нет. Ты сказала."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker confirms that something happened ("Yes"), then asks if Adalind told someone about it, and the answer is "No", followed by the revelation that it was actually the person they're speaking to who revealed the information ("You did"). The other translations do not accurately convey this meaning and do not fit with the context of the conversation.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Джульета, мы делаем так, как можем. Ты знаешь, во сколько обойдется дом престарелых? Я думала, ты нанял девушку заботиться о ней. Сана заботится.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The verb "заботиться" (to take care of) is the appropriate verb to describe what Sana'a is doing for Julieta's mother. The other options presented in the multiple-choice question, such as "делает" (does), "хочет" (wants), "думает" (thinks), "занимается" (is engaged in), "знает" (knows), "может" (can), "поступает" (acts), "помогает" (helps), "понимает" (understands), and "говорит" (speaks) are not suitable in the context of the sentence and do not accurately convey the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:["Найдите человека со способностями и убейте". Но потом появились вы, и мы наконец-то увидели настоящего, живого урода, испускающего ударные волны. Вот только мы не думали, что это была маленькая скромная девушка. Если бы мы знали, то вместо этого преследовали бы тебя.]This translates back to the given English sentence as:"Get a powered person and kill it." But then you all were there, and we finally got to see a real, live freak emitting shock waves. Only thing is, we didn't think it was a tiny, unassuming little girl. If we knew, we would have pursued you instead."
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Я не собираюсь сидеть тут и говорить вам с Морганом, что брак - это устаревшая концепция, а потом жениться на нем. - Да, но ты любишь его, не так ли? - Конечно, люблю."This is because this translation accurately conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence, without changing the intended message. It uses the correct grammar and vocabulary to express the same ideas as the English sentence. All the other options provided in the question contain incorrect grammar, vocabulary or sentence structure, and do not convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Ну, ладно. О, да. Он всё понял. Ясное дело, понял.].This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. "Ясное дело" can be translated to "damn right" in this context, indicating strong agreement. "Понял" means "he understood," which matches the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation is: "Твою мать! Заклей ей рот, пожалуйста. Наглухо. Если сделаешь это, то умрет невиновный, а настоящий убийца будет на свободе."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, using the appropriate idiomatic expressions and vocabulary. The imperative verb "сделаешь" (do) in the conditional clause is the correct translation for "if you do" in this context. The use of the vulgar expression "Твою мать!" (Your mother!) reflects the frustration and urgency of the speaker in the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Это была исследовательская компания, тестировавшая новые лекарства. Вот неопровержимое доказательство. Вот что связывает Девида Лииса с UK Remicon. Связывало бы, если бы только Greenfern не закрылась 6 лет назад."This is because the phrase "It would do" in the English sentence is referring to the previous statement about Greenfern being closed down six years ago. This means that the correct translation should use the conditional form "Связывало бы" which means "it would link" instead of "делало бы" (it would do), "могло бы" (it could have), "помогало бы" (it would help), or "говорило бы" (it would say) in the other options.
The correct Russian translation is: [(прочищает горло) Я подарил ей колье вместо кольца. Понимаете, о чём я? Понимаю.].This is because "понимаю" is the correct translation for "I do" in this context, indicating agreement or understanding. The other options do not convey the same meaning and would not be appropriate translations in this context.
The correct Russian translation is:[Родители открыли его около 50 лет назад. Мы с братом стали здесь работать где-то 5 лет назад, после смерти родителей. Ваши родители когда-то либо видели монстра? Отец клялся, что видел.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:    [Отец клялся, что делал] - This translates to "Father swore that he did," which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.   [Отец клялся, что хотел] - This translates to "Father swore that he wanted," which also doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.   [Отец клялся, что думал] - This translates to "Father swore that he thought," which doesn't accurately convey the idea that the father saw the monster.   [Отец клялся, что занимался] - This translates to "Father swore that he was busy," which again doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.   [Отец клялся, что знал] - This translates to "Father swore that he knew," which is close in meaning to the correct translation, but doesn't convey the idea that the father actually saw the monster.   [Отец клялся, что мог] - This translates to "Father swore that he could," which is again close in meaning to the correct translation, but doesn't accurately convey the idea that the father saw the monster.   [Отец клялся, что поступал] - This translates to "Father swore that he acted," which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.   [Отец клялся, что помогал] - This translates to "Father swore that he helped," which doesn't accurately convey the idea that the father saw the monster.   [Отец клялся, что понимал] - This translates to "Father swore that he understood," which doesn't accurately convey the idea that the father saw the monster.   [Отец клялся, что говорил] - This translates to "Father swore that he said," which again doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Тогда мы вернемся к тому, что человечество само будет решать свою судьбу. Конечно вы не настолько наивны. Вы знаете, что скоро появится еще один ИИ. Нет, наверняка не знаю, как и вы.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided have mistranslations or incorrect word usage, which would result in a different meaning. For example, the options "Нет, наверняка не делаю, как и вы" (No, certainly not doing, like you) and "Нет, наверняка не хочу, как и вы" (No, certainly not want to, like you) have incorrect verb forms that do not match the context of the sentence. Additionally, the option "Нет, наверняка не поступаю, как и вы" (No, certainly not acting, like you) has an incorrect verb form and conveys a different meaning from the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Ты и Мэри Гудвин? Да, и мне не нравится твой тон. Когда я услышал об отце, я ни на секунду не поверил, что он покончил с собой. И, честно говоря, Дюваль, я разочарован, что ты поверил.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning and tone of the original sentence in English. The verb "поверил" (poveril) means "believed", which is the correct verb to use in this context to convey that Duval believed that the father had killed himself. The other verb options such as "сделал" (sdelal) meaning "did" or "захотел" (zakhotel) meaning "wanted" or "занялся" (zanyalsya) meaning "engaged" do not fit the context of the sentence and change the intended meaning of the statement. Therefore, the first option is the most accurate translation of the given English sentence into Russian.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Ну, иногда ты не можешь их спасти, и они умирают. Да, такое случается. Ты хранишь их всех в своем сердце? Да, храню."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The other options presented have different verbs that do not match the meaning of the sentence. For example, "делаю" (do) and "занимаюсь" (occupy oneself with) are not appropriate translations for "keep in your heart." Similarly, "хочу" (want) and "думаю" (think) do not accurately reflect the intended meaning. "Храню" (keep) is the correct verb in this context, meaning that the person holds the memories of the deceased individuals in their heart.
The correct translation would be: [Полиция, суд... Свидетельствовать против сына правительственного советника... Она потеряет Алладина если она этого не сделает. Она будет подвергаться воздействию, если она согласится.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is discussing a situation where a woman is being asked to testify against the son of a government advisor, and is faced with a difficult choice: if she doesn't testify, she will lose Aladdin (presumably a person she cares about), but if she does testify, she will be exposed to some negative consequence. The phrase "she'll be exposed" in the original sentence suggests that there is some sort of risk or negative consequence associated with testifying, and the phrase "if she does" indicates that this risk will only materialize if she goes ahead with it. The phrase "she'll lose Aladdin" suggests that there is something she stands to lose if she doesn't testify, but it's not clear exactly what that is from the given context. The phrase "a court of law" implies that this is a legal matter, and the presence of the police also suggests that this is a serious situation. Overall, the translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence "{Not if he had his timings right... It takes two people to get someone into a dress? Quite intricate. .. which he did.}" is: "[Нет, если всё правильно рассчитать... "Неужели нужны два помощника, чтобы надеть платье?" "Оно довольно сложное". ... а он рассчитал.]"This is because the Russian translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "if he had his timings right" is translated as "если всё правильно рассчитать" which means "if everything is calculated correctly". The phrase "It takes two people to get someone into a dress? Quite intricate. .." is translated as "Неужели нужны два помощника, чтобы надеть платье?" "Оно довольно сложное" which means "Do you really need two assistants to put on a dress? It's quite complicated". Finally, the phrase "which he did" is translated as "а он рассчитал" which means "and he calculated it".
The correct Russian translation is: [Может быть. Но его действия стали более интенсивными и непредсказуемыми, с тех пор, как он убил свою мать на той лодке. Отлично, потому что я не хочу, чтобы он действовал привычным образом. А я хочу.]This is because the last sentence in the English sentence is "Well, I do, okay?" which indicates that the speaker wants him to stain his routine, despite what was said before. The correct Russian translation is "А я хочу," which means "And I want to." This is the only option that accurately conveys the speaker's desire to see the person's routine stained, as the other options either do not express a desire to act (e.g. "A я делаю," which means "And I do") or suggest a different motivation or action altogether (e.g. "A я думаю," which means "And I think," or "A я помогаю," which means "And I help").
The correct Russian translation is: [Лорел... Мы не позвонили Ашеру в тот день. Ни у кого не было его номера. А если бы позвонили и поговорили бы с ним, то ничего бы не случилось.]This is because the phrase "if we did" in the original English sentence refers to the action of calling Asher, which is most accurately translated as "если бы позвонили" in Russian. The other options provided in the question use verbs like "сделали", "захотели", "подумали", "узнали", "смогли", "помогли", or "сказали", which do not convey the same meaning as "позвонили" and are therefore incorrect translations in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "размытыми и говорящими, как Зул. Значит миссия выполнена? А Рейган тебе ничего не говорила? Да, она, вообще-то, сказала."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The sentence is about someone who is talking in a blurry manner, like the character Zuul from the movie Ghostbusters. The speaker then asks if the mission has been accomplished, and whether Reagan (presumably a person in the context of the conversation) said anything. The response is that Reagan did, in fact, say something.The other options provided in the question contain different verbs in place of "сказала" (said). These options do not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence, and therefore are not correct translations.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Я отдал "конторе" 30 лет жизни. И я был безупречно лоялен. Я действительно верил в это. И до сих пор верю."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The verb "верю" (believe) in the last sentence is the correct translation because the speaker is saying that they still believe in the company, even after giving it 30 years of their life and being unfailingly loyal. The other options do not accurately convey the same meaning.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Вы хоть домой вчера уходили? Мия была убита пять недель назад. Значит, она не отправляла сообщения Джейсону. Да, не отправляла.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The other options provided have different verbs and verb forms that do not fit the context of the sentence. For example:    "Да, не делала" (No, she didn't do it) uses the verb "делать" (to do) which does not fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is referring specifically to not sending messages to Jason, not just any action.   "Да, не хотела" (No, she didn't want to) uses the verb "хотеть" (to want) which again does not fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is not referring to Mia's desires or intentions, but rather her actions.   "Да, не думала" (No, she didn't think) uses the verb "думать" (to think) which is not appropriate in this context. Mia's actions regarding sending messages to Jason are not related to her thoughts.   "Да, не занималась" (No, she wasn't busy with it) uses the verb "заниматься" (to be busy with) which does not fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is not referring to Mia being too busy to send messages to Jason, but rather to her not doing so at all.   "Да, не знала" (No, she didn't know) uses the verb "знать" (to know) which is not relevant in this context. The sentence is not referring to Mia's knowledge or lack thereof, but rather to her actions.   "Да, не могла" (No, she couldn't) uses the verb "мочь" (to be able to) which is not appropriate in this context. The sentence is not referring to Mia's ability or inability to send messages to Jason, but rather to her not doing so at all.   "Да, не поступала" (No, she didn't behave in that way) uses the verb "поступать" (to behave) which is not appropriate in this context. The sentence is not referring to Mia's behavior, but rather to her actions regarding sending messages to Jason.   "Да, не помогала" (No, she didn't help) uses the verb "помогать" (to help) which does not fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is not referring to Mia helping or not helping someone, but rather to her not sending messages to Jason.   "Да, не понимала" (No, she didn't understand) uses the verb "понимать" (to understand) which is not relevant in this context. The sentence is not referring to Mia's comprehension or lack thereof, but rather to her actions.   "Да, не говорила" (No, she didn't say) uses the verb "говорить" (to say) which does not fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is not referring to Mia speaking or not speaking, but rather to her not sending messages to Jason.
The correct Russian translation is: "Мама сказала никогда не говорить об этом. В течение нескольких лет после похорон, мы никогда не покидали дом. Я никогда не делал вид, что понимаю страдания моего отца. Но возможно ты понимаешь."This is the correct translation because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The other translations contain incorrect verb forms, which change the meaning of the sentence. For example, "Но возможно ты делаешь" means "But maybe you are doing it", which does not fit with the context of the sentence. Similarly, "Но возможно ты занимаешься" means "But maybe you are busy", which is not related to the topic at hand. Overall, the correct translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Можете не понимать меня, можете мне не верить, детектив, но я очень люблю обе свои семьи. Наверное, трудно жить двойной жизнью. То, что вам это удавалось столько лет, заставляет задуматься, что бы вы сделали, узнай об этом Кейт. - Но она не узнала.]
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Потому что я люблю тебя. Правда. Я люблю тебя. Всегда любил."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which expresses the speaker's love for someone and the fact that they have always loved them. The word "любил" in the final sentence is the past tense of the verb "любить" (to love), which fits with the context of the sentence. None of the other options provided convey the same meaning or use appropriate verb tenses to match the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: [Ну, может это он, но я ничего не говорил. Зои сказала Нику, и теперь он, вероятно, порвет со мной. Так что ты можешь сказать спасибо своей девушке за то, что критиковала меня. Клянусь, я не делал...].This translation is correct because it accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence, with the appropriate grammar and vocabulary choices. The other translations provided have different verb forms or vocabulary choices that alter the meaning of the original sentence or are not grammatically correct.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Я думаю, нам нужно поговорить о Калебе. Калеб украл твои деньги и встречался с женщиной, которая передала ему это. Я думаю, они связаны, но не знаю как. Может, ты знаешь."This is because the correct translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence, while the other options either use the wrong verb form or do not convey the intended meaning.Option 2: "Может, ты делаешь" means "Maybe you are doing," which does not make sense in this context.Option 3: "Может, ты хочешь" means "Maybe you want," which is not appropriate in this context as the speaker is asking for help, not expressing a desire.Option 4: "Может, ты думаешь" means "Maybe you are thinking," which is close in meaning to the correct option but not exactly the same.Option 5: "Может, ты занимаешься" means "Maybe you are engaged in," which does not make sense in this context.Option 6: "Может, ты можешь" means "Maybe you can," which is close in meaning to the correct option but not exactly the same.Option 7: "Может, ты поступаешь" means "Maybe you are acting," which does not make sense in this context.Option 8: "Может, ты помогаешь" means "Maybe you are helping," which is close in meaning to the correct option but not exactly the same.Option 9: "Может, ты понимаешь" means "Maybe you understand," which is close in meaning to the correct option but not exactly the same.Option 10: "Может, ты говоришь" means "Maybe you are speaking," which does not make sense in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Даже не заводи меня насчет его солиситора. Ты прижала Хантли вождением? Я знаю, как работать под прикрытием. Я и не говорил, что ты не знаешь.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. Here's the breakdown:"Даже не заводи меня насчет его солиситора" translates to "Don't even get me started on the solicitor." This accurately captures the speaker's frustration and desire not to discuss the solicitor in question."Ты прижала Хантли вождением?" translates to "You pressed Huntley on the driving?" This accurately conveys the question the speaker is asking."Я знаю, как работать под прикрытием" translates to "I know how to work undercover." This accurately conveys the speaker's confidence in their ability to work undercover."Я и не говорил, что ты не знаешь" translates to "I never said you didn't." This accurately conveys the speaker's clarification that they never claimed the listener didn't know how to work undercover.The other options provided contain various errors in grammar, vocabulary, or meaning that make them inaccurate translations of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Чудака, создавшего Марголема? Я слегка выкрутила ему руки или яйца, и он дал мне заклинание. Живо-глину тяжело достать, но Фогг совсем не защищает свой тайник, будто он хотел, чтобы я её стащила. Ну я и стащила.]
The correct translation is: [Я люблю людей. Я не люблю Риггса. Если ты хочешь с ним ужинать, то иди ужинай. Если не хочешь, не иди.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other translations have different verbs or noun forms that do not fit the context, such as "не делай" (don't do), "не думай" (don't think), "не занимайся" (don't occupy yourself), "не знай" (don't know), "не поступай" (don't act), "не помогай" (don't help), "не понимай" (don't understand), or "не говори" (don't speak).
The correct Russian translation is:[Я восхищался ею. Гораздо больше, чем её муж или сын. Думаешь, мне есть дело, до того, кого ты восхищаешься, а кого нет? Нет, я не имею дела, но я всё равно говорю тебе об этом, потому что ты мой пленник.]This is because the correct translation should accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. The given sentence is spoken by someone who is addressing their prisoner, and they are stating that they admired a woman more than her husband or son. They then ask the prisoner if they think it matters to them whom the speaker admires or doesn't admire, and answer their own question by saying that they are telling the prisoner anyway because they are their captive.Among the options given, only the first translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The other translations have various errors in grammar, vocabulary, or word order that make them incorrect or awkward. For example, some of the translations use the wrong verb or preposition, while others have incorrect word order or incorrect verb conjugation. Therefore, option 1 is the correct translation.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "О, правда? Ты завидовал чему-то во мне? Да. Я завидую, Эдди."This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is responding to a question and admitting that they do envy something about the person named Eddie. The other options do not convey this meaning accurately and instead use different verbs such as "doing," "wanting," "thinking," "knowing," "occupying," "being able to," "acting," "helping," "understanding," or "speaking."
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Она не говорила "помощь". Значит, ты тоже это услышал. Эй, Дельгадо, передай спасибо маме за мой новый скринсейвер. Сделаю, Паркер.]This is because "will do" is an idiomatic expression used to indicate that someone will take care of something or do as requested. However, in Russian, there is no equivalent idiom for "will do." Instead, the appropriate translation for "will do" would be "сделаю" which means "will do" or "I will do it."Therefore, the correct translation is "Сделаю, Паркер" which means "I will do it, Parker."
The correct translation is: "Не надо. Не уходи. Сдуру я поверила, что всё изменилось. Думала, что ты тоже изменился."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence, which is a plea for someone not to leave because the speaker had mistakenly believed that things had changed between them. The phrase "I think you did, too" suggests that the other person may have also had false hopes about the situation, which is conveyed in the Russian translation with the phrase "Думала, что ты тоже изменился" (I thought that you had also changed). The other translations have either incorrect verb forms, incorrect verb tense or incorrect word choice that deviate from the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Ты просто пытался заставить меня думать, что я был в выигрыше. Все сложилось. Как ты знал, что Барбара появится на складе? Я не знал."None of the given options accurately captures the intended meaning of the English sentence. Each of the provided translations has a different verb in the last clause, which changes the meaning of the sentence. For example, "Я не делал" means "I didn't do it", "Я не хотел" means "I didn't want to", "Я не думал" means "I didn't think", and so on.The correct translation should convey that the speaker did not know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse, despite the other person's attempts to make them think they had control of the situation. The closest translation is the one provided above, which accurately conveys the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Они убили моих родителей. Заполонили город, который я клялся защищать. Этот ребенок никакого отношения к этому не имеет. Конечно, имеет.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The key phrases "murdered my parents" and "invaded the city" are translated correctly, and the phrase "sworn to protect" is translated as "который я клялся защищать," which means "which I swore to protect." The phrase "that kid's got nothing to do with all that" is translated as "Этот ребенок никакого отношения к этому не имеет," which means "this child has nothing to do with this," and the response "Of course he does" is translated as "Конечно, имеет," which means "Of course he does."The other translations provided include incorrect verbs or phrases that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Это из-за Джастина Фоули? Он тебя чем-то обидел? Нет, пап. Ведь, знаешь, если он обидел, я убью его.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The other options provided do not accurately capture the intended meaning, as they contain different verbs that do not match the context of the sentence. For example:    "Он тебя чем-то обидел?" (Did he offend you in some way?) is the correct translation for the question "He do something to you?", which implies that Justin may have done something wrong to the person speaking.   "если он сделал" (if he did) is not an appropriate translation for the context of the sentence, as it does not indicate what Justin might have done.   "если он захотел" (if he wanted) and "если он подумал" (if he thought) do not accurately reflect the implied threat in the sentence, which suggests that the speaker would harm Justin if he had done something wrong.   "если он занялся" (if he started), "если он узнал" (if he found out), "если он смог" (if he managed to), "если он поступил" (if he behaved), "если он помог" (if he helped), and "если он понял" (if he understood) are not appropriate translations for the context of the sentence and do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is:[Если его не будет к этому моменту, то мы что-нибудь придумаем. Он вернется. Я думаю, ты права, он, возможно, вернется. Но когда он вернется, тебе надо будет объяснить все это творческое писание и почему ты это делала].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, including the conditional statement, the expression of confidence that the person will probably return, and the obligation for the speaker to explain their creative writing to the person upon their return. The other options presented have different verb tenses or use incorrect verbs that do not accurately capture the meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [А в какую школу ты ходил? Какое-то время в школу Джефферсона. В каком году закончил? Я не закончил.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first part of the translation asks "Which school did you go to?", which corresponds to the English sentence "Where'd you go to high school?". The second part of the translation states "For a while to Jefferson school", which is a reasonable translation of "Jefferson for a while". The third part of the translation asks "In which year did you finish?", which corresponds to the English sentence "What year did you graduate?". The final part of the translation states "I didn't finish", which accurately conveys the meaning of "I didn't".The other translations do not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence, as they use different verbs or phrases that do not match the meaning of the English words.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [И я, наконец-то, свободна от тебя и готова возвыситься. Посмотри на город. Они боготворят меня. А те, кто не боготворят, станут.]This is because the verb "worship" in the English sentence is translated to the verb "боготворят" in Russian, which means "to worship." The correct form of this verb to use in this context is the third-person plural form, "боготворят," to agree with the subject "they" referring to the people in the city.The word "will" in the English sentence is translated to the Russian word "станут," which means "will become." This verb is used in the third-person plural form to agree with the subject "those who don't worship me" (те, кто не боготворят), which is also plural.Therefore, the correct translation is: [И я, наконец-то, свободна от тебя и готова возвыситься. Посмотри на город. Они боготворят меня. А те, кто не боготворят, станут.]
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Рози, могу я дать тебе один совет? Перестань ныть. Я не ною. Нет, ноешь.]This is because the phrase "Yes, you do" is a response to the statement "I don't whine." In the correct translation, "Нет, ноешь" (No, you whine) is the appropriate response to indicate that the person being addressed (Rosie) actually does whine, contrary to their earlier statement.The other options given in the multiple-choice question do not convey the same meaning and are not appropriate translations in this context. For example, "Нет, делаешь" (No, you do) and "Нет, хочешь" (No, you want) do not convey the same sense of contradiction as "No, you whine." Similarly, "Нет, занимаешься" (No, you're busy) and "Нет, знаешь" (No, you know) do not fit the context of the conversation.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Да. Ты мне так нравишься... Я когда-нибудь говорила это? Да-да, говорила.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "so like you" is translated as "так нравишься" in Russian, which means "I like you so much." The question "Did I ever say?" is translated as "Я когда-нибудь говорила это?" in Russian. And the response "Yes, yes, you did" is translated as "Да-да, говорила" in Russian, which means "Yes, yes, you said it."The other options provided in the question are incorrect because they use different verbs or forms of verbs that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence. For example, "делала" means "did," "хотела" means "wanted," "думала" means "thought," and so on. Therefore, option [Да. Ты мне так нравишься... Я когда-нибудь говорила это? Да-да, говорила.] is the correct translation.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Мы никого не просили это делать. Это кто-то из вашей работы? Вы просили кого-то это сделать? Подождите, нет, нет, не просил.]Out of the options given, this translation is not an exact match to any of them. Here's why:    Option 1: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "забрать" which means "to pick up" or "to take away," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 2: This translation is also mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "делал" which means "did" or "made," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 3: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "хотел" which means "wanted," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 4: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "думал" which means "thought," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 5: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "занимался" which means "was engaged in" or "was occupied with," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 6: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "знал" which means "knew," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 7: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "мог" which means "could," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 8: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "поступал" which means "acted," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 9: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "помогал" which means "helped," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 10: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "понимал" which means "understood," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 11: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "говорил" which means "said," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.Therefore, the correct translation is option that is not listed, [Мы никого не просили это делать. Это кто-то из вашей работы? Вы просили кого-то это сделать? Подождите, нет, нет, не просил.].
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Вы, должно быть, очень заняты. Но раз нам вместе работать над этим выселением, я подумала, почему бы не перекусить вдвоем. Я всегда был другом вашей компании, вы знаете. Знаю.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The translation means "You must be very busy. But since we are going to work together on this eviction, I thought, why not have a meal together. I have always been a friend of your company, you know that. Yes, I know."The other translations contain some errors or awkward phrasing that does not accurately reflect the original meaning. For example, "Делаю" (I do) and "Хочу" (I want) are incorrect translations of "Mm, I do" in this context. "Думаю" (I think) and "Могу" (I can) are also not appropriate translations for this sentence. Similarly, "Есть" (to eat) and "Помогаю" (I am helping) do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я здесь, чтобы вернуть Эмму. Ну что ж, удачи с этим. Ты не сможешь завладеть лампой. Но даже если сделаешь, желания ты не загадаешь.]This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options contain variations in the verb form that change the meaning of the sentence. For example, the second option has the word "сделаешь," which means "make" instead of "did" or "undo" as in the original sentence. The other options have similar variations that make them incorrect translations.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Тебе не нужно уезжать. Кто я, если останусь? Никто этого не хотел. Кто-то да хотел.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The first sentence "You don't have to leave" is translated to "Тебе не нужно уезжать", which means "You don't need to leave". The second sentence "Who am I if I stay?" is translated to "Кто я, если останусь?", which means "Who am I if I stay?". The third sentence "Nobody wanted this" is translated to "Никто этого не хотел", which means "Nobody wanted this". The last sentence "Somebody did" is translated to "Кто-то да хотел", which means "Somebody did".
The correct Russian translation is: [Хорошо, мы все достаточно повеселились, почему бы нам не открыть учебники? Глава 7, Сражение при Аппоматтоксе. Мы проходили это вчера. Нет, не делали.].This translation captures the meaning of the original English sentence accurately. The sentence is a suggestion to open up textbooks and start studying chapter seven on the Battle of Appomattox after having fun. The response "We did that yesterday" is negated by "No, you didn't," indicating that the speaker believes the students did not study it yesterday. The word "делали" (did) in the correct translation captures the meaning of the response accurately. None of the other options provide an accurate translation for this sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the English sentence is: "Они так увлечены. Уверены, что чего-то добьются. Мне пришлось вернуть Шеннон её прототип. Сказала, что не будет со мной разговаривать, пока я не верну."This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first two sentences indicate that "They get so excited" and "They think they can do anything." The third sentence states that "I had to give Shannon back that gizmo." The fourth sentence explains that "She said she'd never speak to me if I didn't."The Russian translation provided accurately reflects these statements and uses appropriate grammar and vocabulary to convey the same meaning in Russian. None of the other translations accurately convey the same meaning and some of them use incorrect grammar or vocabulary, making them incorrect translations.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [А.Н.Б-шница упертая, помнишь? Не, не, не, не, не. Если один из моих помощников разговаривал с АНБ, ты обязана меня проинформировать. Анна не говорила.].This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "NSA hard-ass, remember?" is translated to "А.Н.Б-шница упертая, помнишь?", which conveys the same sense of a strict, uncompromising organization. The phrase "If one of my associates talked to the NSA out of school, you have the obligation to inform me" is translated to "Если один из моих помощников разговаривал с АНБ, ты обязана меня проинформировать", which conveys the same sense of an obligation to report any inappropriate communication. Finally, the phrase "Anna didn't" is translated to "Анна не говорила", which accurately conveys the sense that Anna did not communicate with the NSA.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Мою мать. Она не идет у меня из головы. Она всегда хотела этого для меня. А я разбил ей сердце, потому что сам не хотел.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is talking about their mother and how she always wanted something for them, but the speaker did not want it and as a result, broke her heart. The verb "want" is translated as "хотела" which is the correct past tense form in Russian. The verb "broke" is translated as "разбил" which is the correct past tense form of the verb in Russian. The verb "didn't" is translated as "не хотел" which means "did not want" in Russian. This translation also uses the correct possessive form "мою мать" which means "my mother" in Russian.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Он хочет, чтобы ты пришел сюда и предстал перед судом за свои грехи. Перед присяжными, которые меня ненавидят? Черт та с два я приду. Если не придешь, эта толпа будет охотиться за тобой."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, which talks about someone wanting another person to come back and stand trial for their sins before a jury of people who hate the speaker the most. The speaker refuses to do so and warns that if the person doesn't come back, a mob will hunt them down.The other options provided are incorrect because they contain different Russian verbs that don't accurately reflect the meaning of the original English sentence. For example, options like "если не захочешь" (if you don't want to) and "если не сможешь" (if you can't) don't accurately convey the sense of the English sentence, which implies a threat of harm if the person doesn't comply. Only the correct translation accurately captures this sense of threat by using the verb "будет охотиться" (will hunt down).
The correct Russian translation is: "Прости, что? Что? Ты только что назвала меня Робертом. Нет, не называла."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence, where the speaker is expressing confusion and disbelief that they were called by the wrong name. The phrase "no, I didn't" is translated as "нет, не называла," which directly negates the claim that the speaker called the other person Robert. The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
I'm sorry, I cannot determine which one is the correct Russian translation of the given English sentence without additional context.However, I can tell you that some of the options provided contain offensive language and vulgarities, which may not be appropriate in all situations. It's important to use appropriate language in different contexts, such as formal or informal settings, and with different audiences.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is "Если не отзовёшь иск, Кейхил пригрозит отменой сделки. Что? Уже пригрозил."This is because "He already did" in the original sentence implies that Cahill has already threatened to pull the deal, which is correctly translated as "Уже пригрозил" in the given options. The other options do not convey the meaning of the original sentence accurately.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Вам было 14, когда отец выдал вас за мужчину, старше вас на 40 лет. Не представляю, каково это. Отцы должны защищать своих дочерей. А ваш не защищал.].This is because the verb "protect" in the English sentence is translated to the Russian verb "защищать" which means "to protect". Out of all the options provided, only the first one uses the correct verb "защищать" in the correct form "не защищал" to match the past tense of "did not protect". The other options use incorrect forms of the verb such as "не делал" (did not do), "не хотел" (did not want), "не думал" (did not think), "не занимался" (did not engage in), "не знал" (did not know), "не мог" (could not), "не поступал" (did not act), "не помогал" (did not help), or "не понимал" (did not understand), which do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence.
None of the provided translations is an accurate translation of the given English sentence. The translations all contain the phrase "Ты сдашь нам русских, Джимми," which means "You will surrender the Russians to us, Jimmy," but this phrase is not present in the original sentence. Additionally, the translations differ in the word choice and grammar used to convey the hypothetical scenarios presented in the English sentence.A correct translation of the given English sentence into Russian could be:"Тебе нужно отказаться от русских, Джимми. Убирайся отсюда, пока не поздно. Если не уйдешь, то ты скоро окажешься в беде. А я, если не откажусь, то сам скоро окажусь на дне Говануса."This translation conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, including the commands and hypothetical scenarios presented in the English version, while also being grammatically correct and idiomatic in Russian.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Иногда просто... живешь, чтобы сожалеть. Ты не знаешь, о чем говоришь. Да, может и не знаю. Обычно не знаю, так что..." This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is admitting that they may not know what they are talking about and often regret their decisions. The other translations use words and phrases that do not fit the context or convey the same meaning, such as "не делаю" (don't do), "не хочу" (don't want), "не думаю" (don't think), and so on.
The correct Russian translation is: [А теперь. Можно начать сначала, Рэй. Говорила, что всё получится, не так ли? Да, говорила.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is acknowledging that they have a fresh start and that everything has worked out as they predicted. The response "Yeah, you did" confirms that the person being spoken to had previously expressed confidence in the situation working out. None of the other options convey the same meaning as the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Нужно поинтересоваться этим вопросом. Я вел к тому, что ты бы использовал свою рабочую руку. Так зачем Альварезу стрелять в себя с правой руки, если он был левшой? Может, он и не стрелял.].This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The word "стрелять" (strel'yat') means "to shoot" and is the correct verb to use in this context. The other options presented in the answer choices do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "делать" (delat') means "to do" and "хотеть" (khotet') means "to want," neither of which fit in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Меня так взбесил Джефф. И Ханна, за то, что она все драматизировала. Я не знал. Ну, теперь знаешь.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is expressing their anger towards Jeff and Hannah, specifically blaming Hannah for making the situation more dramatic than it needed to be. The speaker then admits that they were previously unaware of the situation, but now the listener is aware of what has happened. None of the other translations accurately convey this meaning.
The correct translation of the English sentence into Russian is: "Нет, не ладно. Вы были правы. Я устала, но я должна научиться справляться с этим. Ты научилась."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is acknowledging that they were wrong and the other person was right. They explain that they were tired, but they recognize the need to learn how to push past it, and they commend the other person for having already learned how to do so. The verb "научилась" (learned) in the last sentence appropriately reflects the past tense and feminine gender of the subject "ты" (you).
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Скоро выздоровеет. Признайся, тебе же понравилось работать с гигантским степлером? Мне немного понравилось им пользоваться. Всем нравится.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "Everybody does" in the original sentence means that everyone likes using the stapler, which is translated as "Всем нравится" in the correct Russian translation. None of the other options include this phrase, making them incorrect translations.
The correct Russian translation is:[Спасибо. За это... и за то, что спасли мою жизнь. За это благодарите нашу службу кейтеринга. Уже поблагодарила.]This is because the English sentence expresses gratitude for two things - the thing being referred to as "this" and for saving the speaker's life. The speaker then suggests that the person should thank the caterer for the "this" part, and says that they already have thanked the caterer. The Russian translation correctly reflects this meaning by using the feminine form "поблагодарила" (poblagodarila) which means "already thanked" in English. None of the other options accurately convey this meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Этот человек спас мою жизнь. Заходи, Майкл. Они покормили тебя? Да, покормили, спасибо.].This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence in Russian. The verb "feed" in English is translated as "покормить" in Russian, and the response "They did, yes, thank you" is accurately translated as "Да, покормили, спасибо" which means "Yes, they fed me, thank you." The other options offered in the question use verbs that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence, such as "сделали" (made), "захотели" (wanted), "подумали" (thought), "занялись" (occupied), "смогли" (could), "поступили" (acted), "помогли" (helped), "поняли" (understood), and "сказали" (said), which do not fit the context and meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:"Ты чего творишь? Нельзя убивать Джонс. Ты опоздал. Уже сделала."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The translation means: "What are you doing? You can't kill Jones. You're too late. I already did."The other options provided do not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. For example, "Уже захотела" means "Already wanted," which does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Similarly, "Уже узнала" means "Already found out," which is not relevant to the sentence.Therefore, the correct Russian translation is the one that accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which is "Ты чего творишь? Нельзя убивать Джонс. Ты опоздал. Уже сделала."
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Но, безусловно, сейчас ты должен быть со своим бедным отцом? Да, я как раз шел к нему. Но решил сначала заглянуть к вам. Я так рада, что ты зашел, мой милый Пьер!]This is because "зашел" (zashel) is the correct Russian word for "look in on" or "drop by," which is the intended meaning in this context. The other options provided use different verbs that do not accurately convey the same meaning as the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Похоже, леди Арабелле не терпится загладить свою вину. - Как мне с ней говорить? - Можешь вообще с ней не встречаться. Ну нет, я встречусь.].This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker acknowledges that Lady Arabella is eager to make amends and wonders how to approach her. When advised not to see her at all, the speaker insists on meeting her anyway. The Russian translation captures the same sequence of events and the speaker's determination to face Lady Arabella despite the difficulties. None of the other options provide an accurate translation of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: [Всё это произошло сразу после того, как Мэри нашла кофту Эли. Да, и нас резко перестали допускать к ней. Может это потому что он не хочет, чтобы мы видели, что он делает с ней. Я видела, и это ужасно.]This is the correct translation because "я видела" (ya videla) is the correct Russian past tense form for "I saw" which matches the past tense in the original English sentence "I did, and it's awful." The other options provided are using incorrect forms of past tense verbs or other verbs that do not accurately convey the meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Наряду с ней было сделано ещё с десяток других снимков, и что-то в них смутило меня, нечто такое, что я не мог мысленно совместить, а потом до меня дошло - все они одинаково кадрированы. Ракурс съёмки не менялся. А вы полагали, что мы ничего не заметим. Но, к сожалению для вас, мы заметили.]
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Когда найдём деньги, об этом можно будет забыть. И когда это случится? Эти идиоты ничего не знают. Нет, но они назвали того, кто знает.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The translation means: "When we find the money, you can forget about it. And when will that happen? These idiots don't know anything. No, but they gave me the name of someone who does."The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning of the English sentence. For example, the options that use verbs like "делает" (does), "хочет" (wants), "думает" (thinks), "занимается" (is engaged in), "может" (can), "поступает" (acts), "помогает" (helps), "понимает" (understands), or "говорит" (speaks) do not accurately reflect the idea of someone who knows about the money. Therefore, they are not correct translations for the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Я разобрался со всем. Малышка, ты ведь всё обо мне знала, когда мы поженились. Да, Джонни, я знала, но мои друзья не знали. Моя семья не знала."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "I handled it" is translated as "Я разобрался со всем", which means "I took care of everything". The phrase "Baby, you knew all that about me when we got married" is translated as "Малышка, ты ведь всё обо мне знала, когда мы поженились", which means "Baby, you knew everything about me when we got married". The phrase "My family didn't" is translated as "Моя семья не знала", which means "My family didn't know".The other options provided have different verbs that do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "Моя семья не делала" means "My family didn't do", which is not a correct translation of "My family didn't know". Similarly, "Моя семья не хотела" means "My family didn't want to", which also does not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Я не убивала Робин. Я даже не знала, что она выяснила правду. Линда, пора все рассказать. Я рассказала.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, which is about the speaker denying that they killed Robyn and admitting that they did not know she had found out the truth. The speaker then tells Linda that it is time to come clean and admits that they themselves have already done so.The other translations do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence. For example, "Я сделала" (I did it) and "Я захотела" (I wanted to) suggest that the speaker has committed a wrongdoing, which is not the case in the original sentence. "Я узнала" (I found out) and "Я помогла" (I helped) are also incorrect because they do not reflect what the speaker is trying to communicate in the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: ["Похоже". Доказательства более чем убедительные. Сол считает их наглядными. Мистер Беренсон так считает.]This is because "calls it conclusive" can be accurately translated to "считает их наглядными" in Russian, which means "considers them to be conclusive." The other options provided are not accurate translations of this phrase and do not convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Перебрал с выпивкой и... Я сделал это ненамеренно, но я изменил ей. Хочешь поговорить об этом? Только что поговорили."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence in Russian. The other options presented do not accurately reflect the meaning of the English sentence. For example, "Только что сделали" would translate to "just did," which does not convey the idea of talking about the situation, and "Только что захотели" would translate to "just wanted," which also does not accurately reflect the idea of having a conversation about the situation. Therefore, the correct translation is the one that accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which is "Только что поговорили."
The correct Russian translation is: [Хорошо, я отправлю ссылку на вашу почту, Jmarks @ JMI.vox. Вообще-то, нет, просто меня взломали, можете отправить ссылку на почту моего ассистента? Это JP123 @ mymail.vox. Хорошо, отправлю.]This is because the correct translation needs to accurately reflect the meaning of the original English sentence. The given Russian sentence accurately conveys the same meaning as the English sentence, including the request to send the link to the assistant's email instead of the original recipient's email due to being hacked. Additionally, the word "отправлю" at the end of the sentence means "will send", which is the appropriate translation for the English "will do" in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:"Не стоит. Я уверена, что на твоей месте многие поступили бы также. Я проиграла. Не проиграла."This translates back to English as:"Don't be. I'm sure many people would have done the same thing in your place. I failed. No, you didn't."The other options given are incorrect because they use different verbs that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. For example:"Не сделала" means "didn't do" and doesn't capture the meaning of "failed" in the context of the sentence."Не захотела" means "didn't want to" and again, doesn't accurately convey the meaning of "failed"."Не подумала" means "didn't think" and doesn't fit in the context of the sentence."Не узнала" means "didn't find out" and is not appropriate in this context."Не занялась" means "didn't engage in" or "didn't take up" and doesn't capture the meaning of "failed"."Не смогла" means "couldn't" and doesn't convey the nuance of "failed" in this context."Не поступила" means "didn't act" or "didn't behave" and doesn't fit in the context of the sentence."Не помогла" means "didn't help" and is not appropriate in this context."Не поняла" means "didn't understand" and doesn't accurately convey the meaning of "failed"."Не сказала" means "didn't say" and doesn't fit in the context of the sentence.Therefore, only the first option accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Вы ранее заявили, что вы установили камеру, потому что вашу машину вскрыли? Верно. Вы нашли виновных? Полиция нашла, да.].This is the correct translation because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The word "нашла" in Russian translates to "found," which accurately conveys the idea that the police were able to identify and apprehend the perpetrators. The other options, such as "сделала" (did), "захотела" (wanted), or "подумала" (thought), do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Огонь, технология, химия. Да, они думали это все магия, пока не узнали, как правильно пользоваться этим. Ты не знаешь как пользоваться магией. Не умеешь, так ведь?]The reason for this is that "you don't know how to use magic" in the English sentence is best translated to "ты не умеешь пользоваться магией" in Russian. While some of the other translations offered could be close in meaning, they do not accurately convey the same nuance and tone as the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Молодец, дорогой. Они не рассчитывали, что придёте вы, мистер Уокер. - Мы сделали это, пап. - Сделали, Сэм.].This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. "Well done, darling" is translated to "Молодец, дорогой" which is a common expression of praise in Russian. "They didn't reckon on you coming along, Mr. Walker" is translated to "Они не рассчитывали, что придёте вы, мистер Уокер", which conveys the idea that the speaker's presence was unexpected. "We did it, Dad" and "We did, Sam" are translated to "Мы сделали это, пап" and "Сделали, Сэм", respectively, which accurately convey the sense of accomplishment and success.The other translations either use incorrect verb forms, such as "захотели" (wanted), "подумали" (thought), "занялись" (got busy), "узнали" (found out), "смогли" (managed to), "поступили" (acted), "помогли" (helped), "поняли" (understood), or "сказали" (said), which do not fit the context and do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Знаете, моя семья очень помогла Карлосу, и теперь ему нужно помочь нам, так что просто скажите ему связаться с моим братом. Я даже не знаю, услышу ли о нём ещё. - Но если услышите? - Если услышу, скажу ему, что вы заходили.]This translates back to English as:[You know, my family has helped Carlos a lot, and now we need him to help us, so just tell him to contact my brother. I don't even know if I'll hear from him again. - But if you hear from him? - If I do, I'll tell him you came by.]
The correct Russian translation is: [Привет. Думал, что сможешь уехать не попрощавшись? Ты же знаешь, я терпеть не могу прощаться. Знаю.]This is because the Russian translation accurately conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence. The speaker is expressing their displeasure at the fact that the person they're speaking to is leaving without saying goodbye. The speaker then goes on to express their dislike for goodbyes. The word "знаю" in the Russian translation means "I know," which is the appropriate response to the statement "you know I hate goodbyes."
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[О вашем "Неоднозначном факторе", сэр. Вы знаете, что это значит. Пожалуйста, скажите, что знаете, чтобы мне не пришлось говорить больше. Конечно, вы не знаете, потому что Вселенная ненавидит нас обоих.]The main difference between the correct translation and the other options provided is in the choice of the verb used in the phrases "Of course you don't" and "because the universe hates us both." The correct translation uses the verb "знаете" (know) which is the appropriate form for addressing someone respectfully in Russian, while the other options use different verbs that are not as appropriate in this context. Additionally, the correct translation uses the phrase "говорить больше" (say more words) instead of "больше говорить" (speak more) which is a more natural way of expressing the idea in Russian.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:Либо у нее будет Чаша, либо мы заставим ее сказать нам, где она находится. Она приведет с собой тех Сумеречных охотников. Они не пройдут через парадную дверь. Даже если пройдут, мы значительно превосходим их в числе.(Note: the correct translation is the first option provided)
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[На этом видео тот же подросток, что и на нескольких до этого. Очевидно, его семья принесла старую плёнку в Стоун-Пост, чтобы оцифровать. Сомневаюсь, что они знали, что у них в руках. Аарон, очевидно, знал.]This is the correct translation because the last sentence in the English text is "Aaron obviously did," which implies that Aaron knew something that the teenager's family did not know. The word "did" indicates that Aaron took action or had a specific knowledge about something. Out of the given options, only "знал" (knew) accurately reflects the meaning of "did" in this context. The other options such as "делал" (did/made), "хотел" (wanted), "думал" (thought), "занимался" (was occupied with), "мог" (could), "поступал" (acted), "помогал" (helped), "понимал" (understood), and "говорил" (spoke) do not accurately convey the meaning of "did" in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Наш друг больше не задаст неуместных вопросов. Его ересь несравнима с угрозой в виде Титанов. Мы едва избежали их. Но ведь избежали, потому что Он предупредил вас.]This is because the translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options contain different verb forms that change the meaning of the sentence. For example, "сделали" means "did" or "made", "захотели" means "wanted", "подумали" means "thought", "занялись" means "took up", "узнали" means "found out", "смогли" means "managed to", "поступили" means "acted", and "помогли" means "helped". These different verb forms do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[- Не проси меня это делать. Мона, умоляю тебя. Ты единственная знаешь, как сделать что-то подобное. Да, знаю.]This translation is the correct one because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The English sentence expresses the speaker's reluctance to do something and begs Mona, who is the only one who knows how to do it, not to ask him to do it. Mona responds by saying "Yes, I do," indicating that she understands what the speaker is going through and has experience in making something similar.The other translations provided do not accurately convey the same meaning as the original English sentence. For example, some of the translations include different verbs that do not match the action being described in the English sentence, such as "делаю" (do) or "хочу" (want). Other translations include verbs that are not appropriate in this context, such as "думаю" (think) or "говорю" (speak). Therefore, the correct translation is the one that accurately conveys the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Я совсем этого не хотела. Мы оба признали правду. Я сказал, что люблю тебя. А ты – что не любишь меня."This is because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is saying that the confession they both made was about their true feelings towards each other, with the speaker admitting their love and the other person confessing that they don't feel the same way. The other answer choices do not accurately convey this meaning and contain incorrect translations of the words and phrases used in the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Кобблпот! Они меня любят. Если бы ты купил результаты выборов, ты бы никогда не узнал. Но теперь ты знаешь.]This is because the verb "know" in the English sentence is translated as "знаешь" in Russian. The other options are incorrect because they use different verbs such as "делаешь" (do), "хочешь" (want), "думаешь" (think), "занимаешься" (engage in), "можешь" (can), "поступаешь" (act), "помогаешь" (help), "понимаешь" (understand), and "говоришь" (speak), which do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Где ты это достал? Пришлось заняться официальным делом на порту с неприветливым сотрудником. Ты втянула Рэя Донована в это, и он убил Ивана. - Ты прав, я это сделала.]None of the options provided in the question match the correct translation. The correct translation includes some additional details that are not present in any of the given options.Here is a breakdown of the differences:Пришлось заняться официальным делом на порту с неприветливым сотрудником. (Had to take care of an official at the port who wasn't friendly.) - This adds more detail about the situation that the speaker had to deal with at the port.Ты втянула Рэя Донована в это, и он убил Ивана. (You brought Ray Donovan into this and he killed Ivan.) - This is the same as in the original sentence.Ты прав, я это сделала. (You're right, I did.) - This is the same as in the original sentence.Therefore, the correct translation is the first option that includes the additional details that were not present in any of the given options.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Я же сказал, что сразу дам знать, если свяжутся. Да, за все это время ты много чего мне говорил, но не все оказывалось правдой. Мы вроде бы договорились, что ты не будешь настаивать, если я решу... Договорились."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options given do not accurately reflect the meaning of the sentence and could potentially be confusing or misleading to someone who is reading or hearing them. Therefore, the first option is the most appropriate translation for the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Что удерживает меня от того, чтобы убить тебя и просто взять телефон? Мой босс звонит, чтобы проверить меня каждый день. Если я не отвечаю, телефон отключают. Он работает только тогда, когда я отвечаю."This is because the correct translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, including the meaning of the idiomatic expressions used. Specifically, "to keep from" is translated as "удерживать от", "check in" is translated as "проверять", "phone gets cut off" is translated as "телефон вырубают", and "it only works if I do" is translated as "он работает только тогда, когда я отвечаю". None of the other translations capture the full meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Если проект пройдет, строительство будет длиться год. Здесь будет очень шумно. Я не знаю, но могу позвонить в агентство. Да, позвоните.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first sentence translates to "If the project goes ahead, the construction will last for a year," which captures the conditional nature of the statement. The second sentence translates to "It will be very noisy here," which is an accurate description of the situation being discussed. The third sentence translates to "I don't know, but I can call the agency," which is an accurate translation of the original sentence. Finally, the last sentence translates to "Yes, please do," which is an accurate and natural way of responding to the offer to call the agency.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Я не знаю про эту. Ты знал, как сделать это секунду назад, а сейчас не знаешь? Я не знаю, папа. Думаю, знаешь."This translation accurately captures the meaning and tone of the original English sentence. The other options either change the meaning of the sentence or use inappropriate words that do not fit the context.For example, "Думаю, делаешь" (I think you are doing it) and "Думаю, хочешь" (I think you want it) both change the meaning of the sentence by suggesting that the father is currently doing or wanting something, which is not implied in the original sentence. Similarly, "Думаю, занимаешься" (I think you are busy), "Думаю, можешь" (I think you can), "Думаю, поступаешь" (I think you are acting), "Думаю, помогаешь" (I think you are helping), "Думаю, понимаешь" (I think you understand), and "Думаю, говоришь" (I think you are saying) all use words that do not fit the context or the meaning of the original sentence. Therefore, the correct translation is the first option provided.
The correct Russian translation is: [Нет. Думаю, ты не стала бы просить меня найти твою биологическую мать, считая, что она могла его убить. Я не знала, что он мёртв, когда просила об этом. И правда, не знала.]This is because the other translations contain different verb forms that do not match the tense or aspect of the original English sentence. For example, "не делала" means "did not do" which implies a specific action in the past, whereas the English sentence uses "did not know" which refers to a lack of knowledge, not a lack of action. Similarly, "не хотела" means "did not want to" which also implies a specific action, whereas the English sentence does not suggest any reluctance or desire to act.The correct translation uses the past tense "знала" (knew) to match the tense of "didn't know" in the English sentence. Additionally, the use of the adverb "правда" (truthfully) accurately conveys the speaker's intention to clarify their lack of knowledge in the situation.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Она умерла. Фигово. Ты, наверное, скучаешь по ней. Да, скучаю."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence, conveying the speaker's sadness at the loss of someone and acknowledging the listener's potential feelings of missing the person as well. The other options presented do not accurately convey the intended meaning and may even be nonsensical or grammatically incorrect.
The correct translation is: "Прости, что? Джош? Ты вызвал копов? Конечно вызвал!"This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is apologizing and then asking Josh if he called the cops. Josh confirms that he did, so "Конечно вызвал!" (which means "Of course I did.") is the appropriate response.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:Вы довольно умны. Вы учились в колледже, получили образование и сейчас сидите за своим столом. Вы думаете, что меня знаете. Ну да, я знаю вас.Out of the options provided, the correct translation is: "Вы довольно умна. Учились в колледже, получили образование, сидите за своим столом. Думаете, что знаете меня. Да, думаю." This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence and uses correct grammar and vocabulary.The other options have different verb tenses or use incorrect vocabulary, resulting in inaccurate or nonsensical translations.
