The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Люди всё ещё готовы рисковать всем ради него, от Белой Гавани до дверей Рамси. Не сомневаюсь. Но Джон не носит имя Старков. Нет, но я ношу.]This is because this translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The Russian words used in this translation match the intended meaning of the English words, and the grammar and sentence structure are also correct.The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence. They either use incorrect grammar or vocabulary or convey a different meaning than the original sentence. For example, "Нет, но я делаю" (No, but I do) or "Нет, но я хочу" (No, but I want to) do not make sense in the context of the sentence, and "Нет, но я думаю" (No, but I think) or "Нет, но я знаю" (No, but I know) do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[То-то он показался мне знакомым. В этой статье сказано, что его казнили. Ребята, когда Хейли узнала код, она словно привидение увидела. Так оно и было.]This translation correctly conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided in the question either use incorrect grammar or have different meanings that do not accurately reflect the original sentence.In the correct translation, "привидение" (prividenie) is used to translate "ghost," which is the correct and most commonly used word for "ghost" in Russian. Additionally, the verb "было" (bylo) is used to indicate that Hayley actually saw a ghost, rather than simply doing something else like thinking or saying.Therefore, the correct translation is: "I knew he looked familiar. This article says he's been executed. Guys, when Hayley recognized the code, she looked like she'd just seen a ghost. That's because she did."
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Потому что я люблю тебя. Правда. Я люблю тебя. Всегда любил."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which expresses the speaker's love for someone and the fact that they have always loved them. The word "любил" in the final sentence is the past tense of the verb "любить" (to love), which fits with the context of the sentence. None of the other options provided convey the same meaning or use appropriate verb tenses to match the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Пожалуйста, дай мне высказаться. Моё мнение веское и ценное. Я не говорил, что это не так. – На самом деле, сказал.] This translation captures the meaning of the original sentence accurately, as it conveys the speaker's request to be heard and respected for their valid and valuable opinion. The phrase "In effect, you did" is translated as "На самом деле, сказал", which accurately reflects the speaker's criticism of the listener's behavior. None of the other translations provide an accurate representation of the original sentence's meaning.
The correct Russian translation is: [- Хорошо! Я думаю, исключая Роллс-Ройс, Вольво делают лучшие автомобильные интерьеры, чем кто-либо. Делают.].This is because the word "делают" (pronounced "delayut") is the correct translation of the English word "do" in this context. The sentence is stating that Volvo currently makes the best car interiors, and "делают" means "make" in Russian. The other options provided in the question are not correct translations of the sentence because they use different verbs with different meanings that do not fit the context.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Дает мне образцы. Здесь какая-то ошибка. Мы не сменяли поставщика, и не заказывали змеиную текилу. Вы точно заказали.]This translation means "Gives me samples. There's been some sort of mistake. We didn't change distributors, and we didn't order snake tequila. You sure did."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, specifically the idea that the speaker did not order snake tequila, but the person they are speaking to did.All the other translations provided in the question have different verbs instead of "заказали" (ordered), which changes the meaning of the sentence. For example, "делали" (did) or "могли" (could) would imply that the person may have been involved in some way, but not necessarily that they ordered the snake tequila. Therefore, the correct translation is the one that includes the verb "заказали".
The correct Russian translation is: [Ну, ладно. О, да. Он всё понял. Ясное дело, понял.].This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. "Ясное дело" can be translated to "damn right" in this context, indicating strong agreement. "Понял" means "he understood," which matches the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation is: "Брюс не должен был попасть в ту комнату. Я должен был добраться до Мэлоуна первым. Да, вы должны были это сделать. Но не сделали, не так ли?"This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence, with the speaker expressing regret that they did not reach Malone first and the other person acknowledging that they should have done so but did not. The other options presented do not accurately convey the intended meaning or grammar of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[О вашем "Неоднозначном факторе", сэр. Вы знаете, что это значит. Пожалуйста, скажите, что знаете, чтобы мне не пришлось говорить больше. Конечно, вы не знаете, потому что Вселенная ненавидит нас обоих.]The main difference between the correct translation and the other options provided is in the choice of the verb used in the phrases "Of course you don't" and "because the universe hates us both." The correct translation uses the verb "знаете" (know) which is the appropriate form for addressing someone respectfully in Russian, while the other options use different verbs that are not as appropriate in this context. Additionally, the correct translation uses the phrase "говорить больше" (say more words) instead of "больше говорить" (speak more) which is a more natural way of expressing the idea in Russian.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence "{Is that a yes? I don't know. I didn't have sex with him. I didn't.}" is:[Это "да"? Не знаю. Я не переспала. Я не переспала.]The reason for this is that "Я не переспала" is a direct translation of the English phrase "I didn't have sex." None of the other options provided are accurate translations of this phrase.The rest of the options provided include various verbs such as "сделала" (did), "узнала" (found out), "захотела" (wanted), "подумала" (thought), "занялась" (engaged in), "смогла" (was able to), "поступила" (acted), "помогла" (helped), "поняла" (understood), and "сказала" (said). These are not appropriate translations for the English phrase "I didn't have sex."Therefore, the correct translation is "[Это "да"? Не знаю. Я не переспала. Я не переспала.]" which accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "За этим делом его потревожили, он напал и жестоко поплатился. На мой взгляд, оправданная самооборона. - Как скажете, сэр. Так и говорю, сержант." This is because the translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence, including the phrase "reasonable self-defense" which is translated as "оправданная самооборона" in Russian. Additionally, the response "так и говорю, сержант" (literally "so I say, sergeant") is an appropriate and natural way for a subordinate to acknowledge and defer to a superior's statement.
The correct Russian translation is: [И они открыли огонь. Парнишка потянулся к бумажнику. А он упомянул, что выстрелил первым? Да, он сказал.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The first sentence states that "they just opened fire," which is translated as "И они открыли огонь." The second sentence describes the kid reaching for his wallet, which is translated as "Парнишка потянулся к бумажнику." The third sentence asks if the person mentioned that he shot first, which is translated as "А он упомянул, что выстрелил первым?" The fourth sentence confirms that he did, which is translated as "Да, он сказал."The other translations do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence. They use incorrect verb forms or unrelated verbs that change the meaning of the sentence. For example, "Да, он подумал" (Yes, he thought) and "Да, он помог" (Yes, he helped) do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Звучит так, будто протестующие годами пытаются добраться до ее отца. Думаешь они готовы исполнить свои угрозы и уничтожить его? Я склонен думать, что кто-то внутри семьи Тёрнеров хочет устроить так, чтобы свадьба не состоялась. Потому что если она состоится,].This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: [- Спасибо. Так что я пытаюсь оправиться. Понимаете? Понимаю.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "finding my feet again" is translated as "оправиться" which means to recover or get back on one's feet. The phrase "You understand?" is translated as "Понимаете?" which means "Do you understand?" The response "I do" is translated as "Понимаю" which means "I understand."The other options provided do not accurately convey the meaning of the English sentence. For example, "Делаю" means "I'm doing it," "Хочу" means "I want," "Думаю" means "I think," and so on, which do not fit in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: [Сейчас ты в группе, которая занимает все твое время и не приносит дохода. И мы снова говорим об этом. Я думал, ты поняла, зачем мне это нужно. Поняла, но это не меняет тот факт, что у нас один источник дохода.]This is because the word "understood" in the English sentence is correctly translated as "поняла" in Russian. The other options are incorrect because they use different verbs that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence. For example, "сделала" means "did" or "made", "захотела" means "wanted", "подумала" means "thought", "занялась" means "started", "узнала" means "found out", "смогла" means "managed", "поступила" means "enrolled", and "помогла" means "helped".
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Можешь сыграть следующей, но я закончу не скоро. Oh. Ты сделал таблетки? Сделал.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The Russian sentence translates to "You can play next, but it will take a while. Oh. Did you make the pills? I did." which is an accurate representation of the English sentence.The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence. For example, "Захотел" means "wanted," "Подумал" means "thought," and "Узнал" means "found out." These translations do not fit the context of the sentence and do not accurately convey the meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Правда в том, что мы мало что знаем о твоих родителях, о тебе, о чем-либо. Значит, ты ни хрена не знаешь. Обо мне. Никто не знает.].This is because this translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The key words and phrases in the sentence are "we don't know much about anything about... your parents, about you, about any of it", "So you don't know shit", and "Not about me. No one does". The correct translation includes equivalent phrases in Russian that convey the same meaning.The other translations contain phrases that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "Никто не делает" (No one does) and "Никто не думает" (No one thinks) do not accurately convey the idea that no one knows about the speaker's life. Similarly, "Никто не поступает" (No one acts) and "Никто не помогает" (No one helps) do not accurately convey the idea that no one knows about the speaker's life.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "О, правда? Ты завидовал чему-то во мне? Да. Я завидую, Эдди."This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is responding to a question and admitting that they do envy something about the person named Eddie. The other options do not convey this meaning accurately and instead use different verbs such as "doing," "wanting," "thinking," "knowing," "occupying," "being able to," "acting," "helping," "understanding," or "speaking."
The correct Russian translation is: "Нет, мы не можем. Только кто-то из Арсенала может. Почему ты не привёл Энзо? Я привёл."This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence, with the appropriate use of verb tenses, pronouns, and vocabulary. The other options contain incorrect verb forms or vocabulary choices that do not match the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Побольше "секретного соуса", как говорят дети. Дети так уже не говорят, дедушка. А я думал, что говорят. Некоторые говорят.]This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The Russian sentence translates to "More of the secret sauce, as kids say. Kids don't say that anymore, grandpa. Oh, I thought they did. Some do." The other options provided have incorrect translations of the original English sentence. For example, "Некоторые делают" translates to "Some do," which is close to the correct translation, but it misses the nuance of "Some kids say," which is an essential part of the original sentence. Similarly, "Некоторые знают" translates to "Some know," which is not an accurate representation of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Это моя команда. Я сержант Майк Симмс, полиция Нью-Йорка. Откуда вы узнали, что мы здесь? Мы не знали.]This is because the Russian words used in this translation match the intended meaning of the English sentence. The other options provided either use incorrect verb conjugation or use words that change the intended meaning of the sentence.For example, in the second option, "мы не делали" means "we didn't do" rather than "we didn't know," which changes the intended meaning of the sentence. Similarly, "мы не хотели" means "we didn't want to" and "мы не думали" means "we didn't think" which are also incorrect translations. Therefore, the correct translation is the one that uses the verb "знать" which means "to know" and matches the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Я совсем этого не хотела. Мы оба признали правду. Я сказал, что люблю тебя. А ты – что не любишь меня."This is because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is saying that the confession they both made was about their true feelings towards each other, with the speaker admitting their love and the other person confessing that they don't feel the same way. The other answer choices do not accurately convey this meaning and contain incorrect translations of the words and phrases used in the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Я хочу сказать, что не нападал на Триш. Зачем мне это? Если бы мне хотелось ее, я просто мог взять. И взял."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence, where the speaker is denying that they attacked Trish and explaining that if they wanted to have sex with her, they could have and did. The use of the verb "взять" (to take) in the last sentence accurately conveys the idea of having sex with someone in Russian language. The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Я хочу знать, думает ли человек, за которого я проголосовала, что он достиг успеха или провалился. У меня нет других мотивов, кроме желания написать хорошую статью. Хотите, чтобы я написала хорошую статью? Конечно, да."None of the provided options is the correct translation because they all contain verbs that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. The correct translation uses the verb "думает" (thinks) to convey the idea of wondering what the person thinks about their success or failure. The other verbs, such as "делаем" (do), "думаем" (think), "занимаемся" (are dealing with), "знаем" (know), "поступаем" (act), "понимаем" (understand), "помогаем" (help), and "можем" (can), do not accurately convey the same meaning as the original English verb "want to know".
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Пора идти глубже. Отслеживай их дыхание. Рано или поздно им придется... выдохнуть. И как только они выдохнут...]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence, which is urging someone to go deeper and track someone's breath to catch them off guard. The phrase "Sooner or later, they gotta... exhale" indicates that the person being tracked will eventually have to breathe out, which provides an opportunity for the tracker to take action.The other options for the Russian translation include different verbs such as "сделают" (will do), "захотят" (will want), "подумают" (will think), "займутся" (will engage in), "узнают" (will learn), "смогут" (will be able to), "поступят" (will act), "помогут" (will help), "поймут" (will understand), or "скажут" (will say). However, these options do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence, which is centered around the act of breathing out.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Ты просто пытался заставить меня думать, что я был в выигрыше. Все сложилось. Как ты знал, что Барбара появится на складе? Я не знал."None of the given options accurately captures the intended meaning of the English sentence. Each of the provided translations has a different verb in the last clause, which changes the meaning of the sentence. For example, "Я не делал" means "I didn't do it", "Я не хотел" means "I didn't want to", "Я не думал" means "I didn't think", and so on.The correct translation should convey that the speaker did not know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse, despite the other person's attempts to make them think they had control of the situation. The closest translation is the one provided above, which accurately conveys the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Она не безумнее, чем покупка прачечной. Но тебе всё удалось. Я правда не думал, что ты справишься. Но ты смогла.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "It's no crazier than you buying the laundromat" means that the thing being referred to (presumably something unusual or difficult) is not more crazy or difficult than something the person being addressed has already accomplished (buying a laundromat). The phrase "You know, and you pulled that off" reinforces this by acknowledging that the person being addressed has already accomplished something impressive.The phrase "I really didn't think you could. But you did" further emphasizes the speaker's surprise at the person being addressed's ability to accomplish difficult tasks. The phrase "But you did" confirms that the person being addressed was able to succeed despite the speaker's doubts.The phrase "But you did" can be translated to Russian as "Но ты смогла" which means "But you managed to do it." This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase and fits well within the context of the entire sentence. Therefore, the correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is [Она не безумнее, чем покупка прачечной. Но тебе всё удалось. Я правда не думал, что ты справишься. Но ты смогла.].
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Она была учителем, рассказчиком. Я хотела быть, как она. Я хотела... Хотела.].This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is expressing their admiration for the woman who was both a teacher and a storyteller and their desire to be like her. The repetition of "I wanted" followed by "I did" suggests that the speaker was able to achieve their goal and become like the woman they admired. The word "хотела" (wanted) is the correct form of the verb to reflect the speaker's past tense desire to be like the woman.
The correct Russian translation is: [Тогда мы вернемся к тому, что человечество само будет решать свою судьбу. Конечно вы не настолько наивны. Вы знаете, что скоро появится еще один ИИ. Нет, наверняка не знаю, как и вы.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided have mistranslations or incorrect word usage, which would result in a different meaning. For example, the options "Нет, наверняка не делаю, как и вы" (No, certainly not doing, like you) and "Нет, наверняка не хочу, как и вы" (No, certainly not want to, like you) have incorrect verb forms that do not match the context of the sentence. Additionally, the option "Нет, наверняка не поступаю, как и вы" (No, certainly not acting, like you) has an incorrect verb form and conveys a different meaning from the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Что? Ты только что назвала меня Робертом. Нет, не называла. Назвала.].This is because the English sentence is a dialogue between two people where one person accuses the other of calling them by the wrong name ("Robert"). The second person denies this accusation initially, but then admits to having called them by the wrong name.The Russian translation option [Что? Ты только что назвала меня Робертом. Нет, не называла. Назвала.] correctly captures the meaning of the original sentence, where the second person first denies calling the first person "Robert" and then admits to having done so. The other translation options do not accurately reflect the content of the original sentence and do not make sense in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Что ты этим хочешь сказать? Я говорю, что тебе придется изменить свои планы. При всем уважении, мисс Уилан, но решения такого рода не принимает начальник штаба, а президент." This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, which is about someone needing to change their plans and that the Chief of Staff does not have the authority to make such decisions, but the President does. None of the other provided translations accurately convey the same meaning as the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Пару раз. И ты видела, как он это делал, ну, там, нищих кормил... Ага, заботился о больных. Видела.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The Russian sentence means "A couple of times. And you saw him doing these things like feeding the poor? Yeah, taking care of sick people. I saw." All the other options provided have different verbs that change the meaning of the sentence, such as "did," "wanted," "knew," "helped," etc.Therefore, option [Пару раз. И ты видела, как он это делал, ну, там, нищих кормил... Ага, заботился о больных. Видела.] is the correct translation.
The correct Russian translation is:[Поначалу я хотел взять одну монету - на память о первом погружении. "Так, давайте сосчитаем". Я не думал, что кто-нибудь заметит. И когда они не заметили...]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The verb "заметили" in the last sentence means "noticed", which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options in the list contain different verbs that do not fit well in the sentence. For example, "сделали" means "made", "захотели" means "wanted", "подумали" means "thought", and so on, which do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Кобблпот! Они меня любят. Если бы ты купил результаты выборов, ты бы никогда не узнал. Но теперь ты знаешь.]This is because the verb "know" in the English sentence is translated as "знаешь" in Russian. The other options are incorrect because they use different verbs such as "делаешь" (do), "хочешь" (want), "думаешь" (think), "занимаешься" (engage in), "можешь" (can), "поступаешь" (act), "помогаешь" (help), "понимаешь" (understand), and "говоришь" (speak), which do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Уезжай и живи с ней, если пожелаешь. Вполне возможно, что ее свадьба состоится. Ты наверняка постарался это предотвратить. Постарался."This is because "постарался" is the correct Russian translation of the English phrase "did your best" which is used to describe the effort someone put into trying to prevent something from happening. The other options provided do not accurately convey the same meaning as "постарался". For example, "сделал" means "did" or "made", but it doesn't convey the same sense of effort or attempt as "did your best". Similarly, "захотел" means "wanted to", "узнал" means "found out", "подумал" means "thought", "занялся" means "started doing", "поступил" means "acted", "помог" means "helped", and "сказал" means "said". None of these words accurately convey the meaning of "did your best" in the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[В этом задействованы очень загадочные силы. Я привёл тебя сюда. Помнишь, Энн? Помню, Джон.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The other options presented do not convey the same meaning and could potentially change the context of the sentence. For example, "Делаю" (option 2) means "doing" or "making," which does not fit in the context of the sentence. Similarly, "Хочу" (option 3) means "I want," which does not convey the same sense of remembering the past.Overall, option 1 is the most appropriate translation as it conveys the intended meaning of the original sentence accurately.
The correct Russian translation is: "Как ты думал, это работает? Я не знаю, как это работает. Я думал, вы, ребята, знаете, как это работает. Мы знаем." This is because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options either use incorrect verb forms or change the meaning of the sentence, which would result in a different message being conveyed.
The correct Russian translation is: "Мама. Чьи это наркотики? Я не знаю. Да, знаешь."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The word "мама" is used to address the mother, which is the direct translation of "mom" in English. The question "who owns the drugs?" is translated to "чьи это наркотики?" and the response "I don't know. Yeah, you do." is translated to "Я не знаю. Да, знаешь." The word "да" in this context means "yes" or "yeah", and it is used to confirm that the mother actually does know who owns the drugs.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Так ты поговорила с Робином? Как все прошло? Ты сказала ему про ребенка? Сказала."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is asking if the listener had a conversation with Robin and if she told him about the baby. The listener confirms that she did tell Robin about the baby. None of the other translations accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Но это выставляет вас в виде подозреваемых. Эй, смотри, только потому что у нас репутация людей вне закона это не значит, что мы имеем что-то общее с убийством. Вам нравится казаться преступником, не так ли? Да, вам нравится.].This is because the verb "like" in the original sentence is used in the present tense, which corresponds to the Russian verb "нравится" in the third person singular form. The other verbs in the sentence also match the third person plural subject "we" in the Russian translation.
The correct Russian translation is: [Наши отношения начались с моей лжи. Я бы не винил тебя, если бы ты подала это заявление тогда или сейчас. Я это заслужил. - И может быть до сих пор заслуживаю.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first part of the sentence ("Наши отношения начались с моей лжи") means "I started this relationship by lying to you." The second part of the sentence ("Я бы не винил тебя, если бы ты подала это заявление тогда или сейчас. Я это заслужил.") means "I wouldn't have blamed you if you had turned in that file then or now. I would have deserved it." Finally, the last part of the sentence ("И может быть до сих пор заслуживаю.") means "And maybe I still do."
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Уверен, что так. Ты ж у нее оружие отнял. Считаешь, осужденным положено пистолеты с собой носить? Все, кого я знаю, делают.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence, including the tone and context. The word "делают" (do) in the last sentence shows that the speaker knows convicted felons who carry guns, and it matches the context of the conversation where the speaker is arguing against the confiscation of the firearm from the convicted felon.The other options contain different verbs that do not fit the context, such as "хотят" (want), "думают" (think), "занимаются" (engage in), "знают" (know), "могут" (can), "поступают" (act), "помогают" (help), "понимают" (understand), and "говорят" (speak). None of these verbs convey the same meaning as "делают" (do) in the correct translation.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Детектив Бош. Мисс Чэндлер. Я же говорила, что наши пути ещё раз пересекутся. Да, вы говорили."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The Russian sentence uses the correct word order and verb forms to express the same meaning. In particular, "наши пути" (our paths) is a more common phrasing in Russian, and "вы говорили" (you said) is the correct response to "Didn't I say" in Russian. The other options provided in the question use incorrect verb forms or inappropriate words, which would change the meaning of the sentence or make it grammatically incorrect in Russian.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:Вы довольно умны. Вы учились в колледже, получили образование и сейчас сидите за своим столом. Вы думаете, что меня знаете. Ну да, я знаю вас.Out of the options provided, the correct translation is: "Вы довольно умна. Учились в колледже, получили образование, сидите за своим столом. Думаете, что знаете меня. Да, думаю." This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence and uses correct grammar and vocabulary.The other options have different verb tenses or use incorrect vocabulary, resulting in inaccurate or nonsensical translations.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Но как уничтожить бактерии без ущерба для пациента? Это очередная научная задача. Так ты думаешь, что сифилис сыграл роль в смерти мистера Макиннеса? Учитывая его семейное соглашение, возможно, сыграл.]This is the correct translation because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are not grammatically correct.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Значит, ты слышал о ней? Я не говорил этого. Да, ты сказал. Он сказал, так ведь?]This is because the original English sentence is a conversation between three people where the first person is asking if the second person has heard of something, and the second person denies having said something, but the third person confirms that the second person did say it.The correct translation captures the meaning of the original sentence by using the appropriate verbs and word order to convey the same information in Russian. In this case, the verb "сказал" (said) is used to describe what the third person did, which accurately reflects their action in the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[И приговоренный Алурой Зор-Эл на 18 лет в Форт Розз. Я полагаю, что ты тоже ненавидишь мою мать, как и все другие сбежавшие заключенные. Я ненавидел.]The key differences between this translation and the options provided are:The verb used in the last sentence is "ненавидел" (nenvidel), which means "hated." This is the past tense of the verb "ненавидеть" (nenavidet'), which is used in the original English sentence. None of the other options use the correct tense.The sentence "I suppose you hate my mother, too. Like all the other escapees." is translated as "Я полагаю, что ты тоже ненавидишь мою мать, как и все другие сбежавшие заключенные." This is a more accurate translation of the original sentence compared to the other options provided. The word "тоже" (tozhe) means "too" and adds clarity to the sentence, indicating that the speaker believes the person they're speaking to hates their mother just like the other escapees do. None of the other options include this word.Therefore, the first option is the correct Russian translation of the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Им повезет, если хоть кто-нибудь в этом департаменте поговорит с ними после той "заказухи" о чрезмерном применении силы полицией Нью-Йорка. Это был другой журналист. И я не знал, что ты читаешь "Таймс". Читаю.]This translates to: "They're lucky if anyone in this department talks to them after that hack job they did on excessive force in the NYPD. That was a different reporter. And I wasn't aware that you read The Times. I do."
The correct Russian translation is: [Я могу о себе позаботиться. Мне не нужна полиция. - Тогда зачем вы нас вызвали? - Я не вызывала.].This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is saying that they are capable of taking care of themselves and do not need the police. The police ask why they were called, and the speaker clarifies that they did not call the police in the first place.The other translations offer different verb tenses or verb forms, which do not convey the intended meaning as clearly or accurately. For example, "Я не поступала" means "I did not act" or "I did not behave," which does not make sense in the context of the conversation. Similarly, "Я не помогала" means "I did not help," which is also not what the speaker is trying to convey.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Кто-кто? Человек с Крита, который говорит, что на Крите все - лжецы. Не знаю такой загадки. Да знаете, это парадокс Эпименида - вы меня сами учили.]This is because it accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence and uses appropriate Russian vocabulary and grammar. The other options contain grammatical errors or incorrect vocabulary choices that make them inaccurate translations of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Да, конечно. Думаю можно. А ему нужен крем от загара? Нужен, да?].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, with the speaker agreeing that they can do something and asking about whether the person needs sunscreen. The use of "нужен" (needed) in the final question is appropriate for asking whether the person requires sunscreen, as it conveys a sense of necessity. The other translations do not accurately convey the same meaning and may use inappropriate verbs or constructions.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Доктор Хамза. А вы, наверно, доктор Варнаси. Я слышала о невероятной операции, которую вы сегодня провели. Да, провели.]This is because the word "pulled off" in the original English sentence is translated as "провели" in Russian, which means to conduct or carry out something, such as a surgery. The other options presented in the question do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Можете не понимать меня, можете мне не верить, детектив, но я очень люблю обе свои семьи. Наверное, трудно жить двойной жизнью. То, что вам это удавалось столько лет, заставляет задуматься, что бы вы сделали, узнай об этом Кейт. - Но она не узнала.]
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я могу остаться здесь навсегда. Вы дали Данни работу? ! Я дал.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The translation of "I can stay here forever" is "Я могу остаться здесь навсегда." The translation of "You gave Danni a job?" is "Вы дали Данни работу?" The exclamation mark in the English sentence indicates surprise or emphasis, which is captured by the exclamation mark in the Russian translation. The correct translation of "I did" is "Я дал," which matches the verb tense and gender of the subject "I" in the sentence.None of the other options provided accurately convey the same meaning as the original English sentence, and some of them do not make sense in the context of the sentence. For example, "Захотел" (wanted) and "Узнал" (learned) do not make sense as responses to the question "Did you give Danni a job?" Similarly, "Помог" (helped) and "Сказал" (said) do not match the verb tense or gender of the subject "I" in the sentence.
The correct translation is: [Она вышла покурить. Еще одно яблоко раздора. И вы поругались? Наверное, поругались, да.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The use of the past perfect tense "She'd gone out for a cigarette" indicates that the action of going out for a cigarette occurred before the other action, which is the bone of contention. The phrase "Another bone of contention" implies that there was a disagreement or argument, which is confirmed by the following question "So you had an argument?" The response "I think we probably did, yes" suggests that there was indeed an argument, but the speaker is not entirely certain. The chosen translation reflects this uncertainty with the use of "наверное" (probably) and accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Люди напуганы. А страх порождает отчаяние. Я должен верить, что вы заботитесь о жителях Готэма? Я и забочусь.]This is because the phrase "I care" is best translated to "Я забочусь" in Russian. The other options such as "Я делаю" (I do), "Я хочу" (I want), "Я думаю" (I think), "Я занимаюсь" (I am engaged in), "Я знаю" (I know), "Я могу" (I can), "Я поступаю" (I act), "Я помогаю" (I help), "Я понимаю" (I understand), and "Я говорю" (I speak) do not convey the same meaning as the phrase "I care" and therefore, are not the correct translations for this sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Это ведь он самый? Ты его убила. Разумеется, не убивала. Да, ну ладно, убила." This is because the original sentence has a clear structure of a question followed by a denial and then an admission of guilt. The correct translation captures this structure accurately. The other options do not convey the same meaning, as they use verbs such as "делать" (to do), "захотеть" (to want), "подумать" (to think), "заниматься" (to be engaged in), "узнать" (to find out), "смочь" (to be able to), "поступить" (to act), "помочь" (to help), "понять" (to understand), and "сказать" (to say), which do not fit the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Вы, должно быть, очень заняты. Но раз нам вместе работать над этим выселением, я подумала, почему бы не перекусить вдвоем. Я всегда был другом вашей компании, вы знаете. Знаю.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The translation means "You must be very busy. But since we are going to work together on this eviction, I thought, why not have a meal together. I have always been a friend of your company, you know that. Yes, I know."The other translations contain some errors or awkward phrasing that does not accurately reflect the original meaning. For example, "Делаю" (I do) and "Хочу" (I want) are incorrect translations of "Mm, I do" in this context. "Думаю" (I think) and "Могу" (I can) are also not appropriate translations for this sentence. Similarly, "Есть" (to eat) and "Помогаю" (I am helping) do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я сказал ей, что ты агент ФБР, если она прикроет тебя, то ты прикроешь её. Что, сказал, что я готов скомпрометировать свой значок? Ты хочешь поймать этих ребят или нет? Ага, хочу, вот только гена продажного копа во мне нет.]This translation is the most accurate and conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Она - отличный пример того, что люди, не стоят твоего сочувствия в любом виде. Уничтожь ее, Диана. Ты знаешь, что она заслужила. Все они заслужили."This is the correct translation because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "Destroy her, Diana. You know that she deserves. That they all do." is translated as "Уничтожь ее, Диана. Ты знаешь, что она заслужила. Все они заслужили.", which accurately conveys the speaker's desire for Diana to destroy the woman because they believe she and all humans are unworthy of sympathy.None of the other translations accurately convey the same meaning as the original English sentence, as they include different verbs and actions that are not present in the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Мы отправим модуль к южному выходу. Будьте осторожны. Он убийца, и мы еще не знаем, какие у него способности. Возможно, знаем."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The Russian sentence translates to "We'll send the module to the South exit. Be careful. He's an assassin, and we don't know what his powers are yet. Perhaps we do." The word "знаем" in the last sentence of the Russian translation means "we do" or "we know," which accurately reflects the uncertainty expressed in the English sentence with the word "perhaps."The other options presented in the question all use different verbs in the last sentence that do not accurately convey the same meaning as the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Убить их? Ты будешь один против всех. Эти люди не умеют сражаться. Вы умеете."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. It tells the person that they would be alone in fighting against all of them, and that the other people don't know how to fight, but the person being addressed does know how to fight. The verb used in the translation, "умеете" (can/are able to), is the appropriate form of the verb to convey the meaning of "know how to" in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Признаю. Но я не убивала того ФБРовца. И почему мы должны тебе поверить? Потому что я могу сказать, кто его убил."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker acknowledges that they have done something wrong (although they deny killing the FBI guy), and when asked why they should be believed, they explain that they can provide information about who did kill the FBI guy. The other options presented in the answer choices do not accurately convey the same meaning and are therefore incorrect.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Молодец, дорогой. Они не рассчитывали, что придёте вы, мистер Уокер. - Мы сделали это, пап. - Сделали, Сэм.].This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. "Well done, darling" is translated to "Молодец, дорогой" which is a common expression of praise in Russian. "They didn't reckon on you coming along, Mr. Walker" is translated to "Они не рассчитывали, что придёте вы, мистер Уокер", which conveys the idea that the speaker's presence was unexpected. "We did it, Dad" and "We did, Sam" are translated to "Мы сделали это, пап" and "Сделали, Сэм", respectively, which accurately convey the sense of accomplishment and success.The other translations either use incorrect verb forms, such as "захотели" (wanted), "подумали" (thought), "занялись" (got busy), "узнали" (found out), "смогли" (managed to), "поступили" (acted), "помогли" (helped), "поняли" (understood), or "сказали" (said), which do not fit the context and do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Но очень сильные. Ты взял свою мать? Привет, Кастиэль. Да, он взял.].This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "It's very powerful" is not included in the Russian translation, which may be because it is not relevant to the conversation or may have been omitted for brevity. The question "You brought your mother?" is translated as "Ты взял свою мать?" which means "Did you bring your mother?" The response "Yes, he did" is translated as "Да, он взял" which means "Yes, he brought (her)". The other options provided in the answer choices contain words or phrases that do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [- Это был не просто блеф. Чем больше я изучал дела моей компании, тем больше находил того, что можно объяснить только вашим существованием. Но я все еще должен был узнать наверняка. Теперь знаю.].This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "Now I do" at the end of the sentence means that the speaker has now come to know something for certain. The Russian word "знаю" (know) in the correct translation conveys the same meaning. The other options given in the question use different verbs such as "делаю" (do), "думаю" (think), "хочу" (want), "занимаюсь" (busy), "понимаю" (understand), "поступаю" (act), "помогаю" (help), and "говорю" (speak), which do not convey the same meaning as "know".
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Даже очень. Очень хорошо. Если... если ты думаешь, что так лучше. Я думаю.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, which is a response to a question or statement indicating agreement or acquiescence. The phrase "Very much so" is translated as "Даже очень," which captures the emphasis and intensity of the speaker's agreement. "Very well" is translated as "Очень хорошо," which conveys a positive attitude towards the situation. The phrase "If, uh... if you think it's best" is translated as "Если... если ты думаешь, что так лучше," which captures the conditional nature of the statement and the deference to the other person's opinion. Finally, the phrase "I do" is translated as "Я думаю," which accurately conveys agreement or assent.
The correct Russian translation is: "Он сказал вам застрелить того человека? Нет, это была самооборона. Если это расстроило его... Похоже, это не вы расстроили его."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker denies that he was told to shoot the man and explains that he acted in self-defense. He then expresses concern that his actions may have upset someone but notes that it doesn't seem like he did so. The Russian translation correctly captures the same sequence of events and the same meaning as the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Но родители Джейка напуганы и встревожены. Они знают не больше нашего. И вы верите им? Да, верю."This is because it accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, which is about the speaker believing Jake's parents despite their lack of knowledge. The other translations either use the wrong verb or do not accurately convey the meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Ну и что, даже если это для нас? Я имею ввиду, он с нами уже год. Разве мы не заслуживаем отметить это? Да, заслуживаем.]This translation accurately captures the meaning and tone of the original English sentence. The use of the verb "заслуживаем" (zasluzhivayem) in the final sentence means "we deserve," which accurately conveys the speaker's sense of entitlement to celebrate. The other translations have different verbs that do not accurately convey the same meaning, such as "делаем" (delayem) which means "we do" and "хотим" (hotim) which means "we want."
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Но он сбежал из тюрьмы. Но Убойное Лицо заставил тебя сбежать. Не так ли? Да, это он сделал.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "he still broke out of prison" is translated as "но он сбежал из тюрьмы" which means "but he escaped from prison". The phrase "But Kill Face forced you to escape" is translated as "но Убойное Лицо заставил тебя сбежать" which means "but Kill Face made you escape". The question "Isn't that right?" is translated as "Не так ли?" which means "Isn't it so?".Finally, the answer "Yes, yes, he did" is translated as "Да, это он сделал" which means "Yes, he did it". This translation accurately conveys the idea that Kill Face forced the person to escape from prison and the person being forced did escape, which is the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Никто не хочет, чтобы это выглядело, как крестовый поход. Я выполняю свою работу. Я не думаю о том, как это выглядит. Ну, генпрокурор думает.].This translation is correct because it accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The sentence expresses the idea that the speaker is simply doing their job and not concerned with how their actions might be perceived, while the attorney general (AG) is concerned with how the situation looks. The word "думает" (thinks) is the appropriate translation for "does" in this context, indicating that the attorney general is actively considering the situation. The other options provided do not accurately capture the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Приходите в офис Лоу-Ривер Компани немедленно. Дуглас Браун. Я не написал этого. Это я сделал."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The phrase "I didn't write this" in the original sentence implies that the speaker did something else to cause the message to be written, and "I did" indicates that the speaker is taking responsibility for that action. The phrase "I did" can be translated as "это я сделал" in Russian, which is used in the correct translation.The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence. For example, "Я не писал этого. Это я захотел" (I didn't write this. I wanted to) and "Я не писал этого. Это я подумал" (I didn't write this. I thought of it) imply that the speaker intended to write the message, but did not physically write it, which is not the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation is: [Просто адвокат, извалял её имя в грязи, пытаясь достать меня. Вы сказали, что знаете, кто её убил. Да, я знаю. По крайней мере, я думаю, что знаю.].This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "at least" is translated as "по крайней мере," and the verb "think" is translated as "думаю." The other options include incorrect translations of "think" such as "делаю" (do), "хочу" (want), "думаю, что думаю" (think that I think), "занимаюсь" (engage in), "могу" (can), "поступаю" (act), "помогаю" (help), and "говорю" (speak), which do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Даже не знаю, любила ли я кого-то так сильно, как ее. Но ты, должно быть, понимаешь, о чем я говорю. Конечно. Да, конечно].This is because the sentence requires the use of specific verbs and grammar structures that accurately convey the intended meaning. The correct translation includes the verbs "знать" (to know), "любить" (to love), and "понимать" (to understand), which are used in their appropriate forms. The other options include incorrect verb forms such as "делать" (to do) or "хотеть" (to want), which do not accurately convey the intended meaning. Therefore, the correct translation option is the one that uses the appropriate verb forms and grammar structures to convey the intended meaning accurately.
The correct Russian translation is:[Спасибо. За это... и за то, что спасли мою жизнь. За это благодарите нашу службу кейтеринга. Уже поблагодарила.]This is because the English sentence expresses gratitude for two things - the thing being referred to as "this" and for saving the speaker's life. The speaker then suggests that the person should thank the caterer for the "this" part, and says that they already have thanked the caterer. The Russian translation correctly reflects this meaning by using the feminine form "поблагодарила" (poblagodarila) which means "already thanked" in English. None of the other options accurately convey this meaning.
The correct Russian translation is:[Там видели машину, пропавшую пять лет назад, принадлежавшую доктору Мэтью Лаксману. Вы её случайно не видели? Нет. Не скажу, что видел.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The Russian translation uses the past tense to describe the sighting of the car that went missing five years ago, belonged to Dr. Matthew Laxman. The question "Вы её случайно не видели?" (Did you happen to see it?) and the negative response "Нет" (No) accurately convey the exchange between the two speakers. Finally, the phrase "Не скажу, что видел" accurately translates the speaker's response "I can't say as I did" in the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Потому что она полюбила не Эльфа? Потому что она любила тебя, Аланон. Я думал, она поняла, что для нас нет будущего. Что ж, очевидно, не поняла.]This is because the phrase "evidently, she didn't" in the original English sentence implies a lack of understanding or realization on the part of the woman being discussed. The correct Russian translation conveys the same meaning by using the phrase "очевидно, не поняла," which means "obviously, she didn't understand." The other options presented do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Шутишь? Тедди, они не собираются продавать магазин. Не может такого быть. Спорим на бесплатную балансировку, что продадут.]This translation captures the meaning of the English sentence accurately. The phrase "Are you serious?" is translated as "Шутишь?" which means "Are you joking?" or "Are you kidding me?". The rest of the sentence is translated properly, with the phrase "Bet you a wheel alignment they do" being translated as "Спорим на бесплатную балансировку, что продадут" which means "I bet you a free wheel alignment that they will sell it."The other options provided do not accurately capture the intended meaning of the English sentence. They either use the wrong verb form or use words that do not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "И теперь я знаю почему. Мне жаль. Я не хотел этого. Но сделал." This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which is that the speaker now understands why something happened and is apologizing for it, but the other person is still upset because it was still done. The use of "сделал" (did) in the last sentence captures the idea that the action was already taken, which is consistent with the context of the original English sentence. The other options use verbs that do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я взяла тебе билет в Бостон на 8:00 утра, значит ты должен быть уже на полпути. Я опоздала на рейс. Харви, ты никогда не пропускаешь свои рейсы. И в прошлый раз, когда ты говорил, что пропустил, ты тоже врал мне.]Note that the main differences between the correct translation and the provided options are:The correct translation uses "на полпути" (halfway there) instead of "одной ногой там" (one foot there).The correct translation uses "пропускаешь свои рейсы" (miss your flights) instead of "опаздывал на рейс" (late for a flight).The correct translation uses "врал мне" (lied to me) instead of "соврал" (lied).
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Что удерживает меня от того, чтобы убить тебя и просто взять телефон? Мой босс звонит, чтобы проверить меня каждый день. Если я не отвечаю, телефон отключают. Он работает только тогда, когда я отвечаю."This is because the correct translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, including the meaning of the idiomatic expressions used. Specifically, "to keep from" is translated as "удерживать от", "check in" is translated as "проверять", "phone gets cut off" is translated as "телефон вырубают", and "it only works if I do" is translated as "он работает только тогда, когда я отвечаю". None of the other translations capture the full meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Все хорошо. А что? О, Ник сказал, что произошло, да? Да, сказал.].This translation conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence, which is "I'm fine. Why? Oh, Nick told you what happened, didn't he? He did." The other options include different verbs that do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "сделал" means "did," but in this context, it does not make sense to say that Nick "did" what happened. Similarly, "захотел" means "wanted," but this does not make sense in this context either. Therefore, the correct translation is the one that accurately conveys the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct translation is: "Ты сказала, бриллианты будут на складе. Нет. Я сказала, что ты их вернёшь, если поедешь на склад. И ты не поехал." This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker clarifies that they did not say the diamonds would be at the warehouse but rather that the listener would get them back if they went to the warehouse. The speaker then confirms that the listener did not go to the warehouse, which is why they did not get the diamonds back. The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Тебе не нужно уезжать. Кто я, если останусь? Никто этого не хотел. Кто-то да хотел.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The first sentence "You don't have to leave" is translated to "Тебе не нужно уезжать", which means "You don't need to leave". The second sentence "Who am I if I stay?" is translated to "Кто я, если останусь?", which means "Who am I if I stay?". The third sentence "Nobody wanted this" is translated to "Никто этого не хотел", which means "Nobody wanted this". The last sentence "Somebody did" is translated to "Кто-то да хотел", which means "Somebody did".
The correct Russian translation is: [Вам нужно время все обдумать. Надеюсь, вы поймете выгоду моего предложения. Мы так обожаем свадьбы. Да, обожаем.].This is because the verb "love" is used in the present tense, which in Russian is translated as "обожаем". The other options such as "делаем", "хотим", "думаем", "занимаемся", "знаем", "можем", "поступаем", "помогаем", "понимаем", and "говорим" do not convey the same meaning as "love" and are not appropriate translations in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:"Клэри улизнула. Я пошел за ней... чтобы защитить ее. Я не сделал ничего такого, чего вы не делали прежде. Да, ты сделал."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided have different verbs in the last sentence that do not accurately convey the intended meaning. For example, "захотел" means "wanted," but the original sentence implies that the person being addressed did something that they had not done before, not just wanted to do something. Similarly, "подумал" means "thought," but the original sentence implies that the person being addressed took action, not just thought about doing something.In summary, the correct translation is the one that accurately conveys the intended meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Из-за пальцев меня всё время замыкает. Так что было? Мы убили Зверя? Убили."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is experiencing a physical problem with their fingers, and they confirm with someone else that they have successfully accomplished a task of killing "The Beast." The verb "убили" (killed) accurately translates the past tense of the verb "kill" used in the English sentence. The other options presented in the answer choices do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Мама сказала никогда не говорить об этом. В течение нескольких лет после похорон, мы никогда не покидали дом. Я никогда не делал вид, что понимаю страдания моего отца. Но возможно ты понимаешь."This is the correct translation because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The other translations contain incorrect verb forms, which change the meaning of the sentence. For example, "Но возможно ты делаешь" means "But maybe you are doing it", which does not fit with the context of the sentence. Similarly, "Но возможно ты занимаешься" means "But maybe you are busy", which is not related to the topic at hand. Overall, the correct translation accurately conveys the intended meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Не из-за того, что я рассказала всё матери. Из-за стресса не происходит разрыва артерий. - Ты сама знаешь. - Я знаю."This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is saying that telling the mother is not the cause of arteries rupturing due to stress, and the other person already knows this. When asked if they know this information, the speaker responds with "Я знаю," which means "I know."The other options presented in the question do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence. They include responses such as "I do," "I want to," "I think," and "I help," which do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is:[Единственное, что сделало бы это лучше... нет облаков и маленький засос на моей шее, ну да ладно. Эй. Ты хочешь чтобы я сделал тебе засос, не так ли? Нет, не хочу, но спасибо тебе за предложение.]This is because the translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The words used in the translation are appropriate and natural in Russian, and the sentence structure is grammatically correct. Additionally, the translation captures the tone and intention of the original sentence, including the humor and casual language used.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Да, у нас есть эта информация. Это не проблема. Место ваше, если захотите. А вы хотите."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The word "хотите" (khoteete) in Russian translates to "you want" in English, which is the correct verb tense for the context of the sentence. The other options provided in the question, such as "делаете" (doelayete) which means "you do" and "думаете" (dumaete) which means "you think," do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Так вот что вы... так вот что вы все думаете? Эмма. Мы пока не знаем, как остановить Аида. А раз не знаем..."This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "Is that you th... is that what you all think?" is translated as "Так вот что вы... так вот что вы все думаете?" The phrase "Emma. We still don't know how to stop Hades" is translated as "Эмма. Мы пока не знаем, как остановить Аида." And the phrase "Until we do..." is translated as "А раз не знаем...", which means "Since we don't know."
The correct Russian translation is: [Стехиометрия? Ничего не понимаю. А ты? Конечно знаешь.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is expressing their lack of understanding of stoichiometry and then asking the listener if they understand it. The listener responds affirmatively that they do understand it. The word "знаешь" means "know" in English, which is the appropriate verb to use in this context to convey that the listener understands the concept of stoichiometry. The other options provided in the answer choices do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct translation of the English sentence "{Jude. I'm sorry, okay? I want to stay. Really, I do.}" into Russian is "Джуд. Прости, ладно? Я хочу остаться. Правда, хочу." This is because the verb "want" in the English sentence is translated as "хочу" in Russian, which is correctly used in the given option. The other options use incorrect Russian verbs such as "делаю" (do), "думаю" (think), "занимаюсь" (engage in), "знаю" (know), "могу" (can), "поступаю" (act), "помогаю" (help), "понимаю" (understand), and "говорю" (speak), which do not convey the same meaning as the verb "want" in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [- Кто не закрыл дверь? - Не я. Я что, не говорил, что нужно запирать дверь? Уэйн, он сказал, что не делал.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker denies being responsible for leaving the front door open and expresses frustration that someone did not follow the instruction to keep the doors closed. Wayne is mentioned as a possible culprit, and he denies being the one who left the door open.

The correct Russian translation is:[Если его не будет к этому моменту, то мы что-нибудь придумаем. Он вернется. Я думаю, ты права, он, возможно, вернется. Но когда он вернется, тебе надо будет объяснить все это творческое писание и почему ты это делала].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, including the conditional statement, the expression of confidence that the person will probably return, and the obligation for the speaker to explain their creative writing to the person upon their return.

И я надеялся, что ты будешь отличаться, но сейчас я начинаю думать, что ты такой же опасный, как и Клаус Майклсон. Я сделал то, что было необходимо. Нет, ты этого не сделал, Марсель!]None of the options provided in the question matches the correct translation. All of the given options contain a verb that does not fit the context of the sentence or uses the wrong form of the verb. For example, "захотел" means "wanted" which does not convey the correct meaning of "did not" in this context. Similarly, "подумал" means "thought" which does not fit the context of the sentence.

The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Которая думает, что ты умная и чудесная... Да, которая стерла мои воспоминания и лгала мне о существовании брата. Я не говорю, что она не сделала чего-то странного. Но все мамы делают.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original sentence.

For example, "хотят" (option 2) means "want" instead of "do," "думают" (option 3) means "think" instead of "do," and "занимаются" (option 4) means "engage in" instead of "do." The other options similarly contain incorrect verb forms or words that change the meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Что ты делаешь? Если ты на их стороне, то падешь вместе с ними. Выбери сторону. Пока не выберешь, мы закончили.]This is because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence in Russian. The other options have various errors or inaccuracies in grammar or vocabulary, which would make them incorrect translations. For example, "пока не сделаешь" (option 2) would translate to "until you don't make", which does not accurately convey the intended meaning of "until you do"; "пока не захочешь" (option 3) would translate to "until you don't want", which is not a natural way of expressing the idea of "until you do"; and so on for the other options.
The correct Russian translation is: "И я... Убил его? Нет. Вообще-то, Джина сделала, но это долгая история."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, which indicates that the speaker is denying responsibility for the killing and explaining that someone else, Gina, is responsible. The word "сделала" in the Russian translation means "did" in English, which matches the context of the sentence. The other options provided in the question use incorrect verbs such as "wanted," "thought," "learned," "managed," "acted," "helped," "understood," or "said," which do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Пусть ваша любовь всегда будет сильной, истинной и бесконечной. Если тебе что-то понадобится, я всегда найду тебя. Обещаешь? Обещаю.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning and tone of the original sentence. Here's a breakdown of the translation:"Пусть" is a particle that expresses a wish or desire, similar to "may" in English."ваша любовь" means "your love.""всегда будет" means "will always be.""сильной, истинной и бесконечной" means "strong, true, and eternal.""Если тебе что-то понадобится" means "If you need anything.""я всегда найду тебя" means "I will always find you.""Обещаешь?" means "Do you promise?""Обещаю." means "I do."The other options provided do not accurately convey the meaning and tone of the original sentence. For example, "Делаю" means "I do it," which does not fit in the context of the sentence, and "Хочу" means "I want," which also does not fit in the context of making a promise.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Мужская, размер большой. Вероятно, использовали, чтобы остановить кровь. Чей, говорите, это номер? Я не говорил.]This translation is correct because it accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided have different verb tenses or incorrect word choices that do not convey the same meaning. For example:"Я не делал" means "I didn't do it," which changes the meaning of the sentence."Я не хотел" means "I didn't want to," which also changes the meaning of the sentence."Я не знал" means "I didn't know," which is not a proper response to the question being asked."Я не мог" means "I couldn't," which is also not a proper response to the question being asked.Therefore, only option [Мужская, размер большой. Вероятно, использовали, чтобы остановить кровь. Чей, говорите, это номер? Я не говорил.] accurately reflects the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [- Я все это знаю. Ты имеешь право на адвоката. - Он мне не нужен. - Нет, нужен.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is being informed of their right to an attorney, but they respond by saying they do not need one. The other person insists that they do need one, which is reflected in the final sentence of the translation: "Нет, нужен" (No, you do need one). None of the other translations accurately convey this meaning.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Ты хороший человек. Ты просто слишком близко стоишь к Овальному Кабинету. Ты чувствуешь власть, и ты хочешь ее.

The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Поговорить об отцовских обязанностях. Хочешь совет, как быть отцом? да. Хочу.]This translation means "Let's talk about fatherhood. Do you want advice on being a father? Yes. Yes, I do."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other translations do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence or contain errors in grammar or vocabulary. For example, "Делаю" means "I'm doing it" and does not fit in the context of the sentence. Similarly, "Занимаюсь" means "I'm occupied" and does not fit in the context of the sentence either.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Она умерла. Фигово. Ты, наверное, скучаешь по ней. Да, скучаю."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence, conveying the speaker's sadness at the loss of someone and acknowledging the listener's potential feelings of missing the person as well.

The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Не могу сказать, сколько раз эти фемофашистки разбивали свои лобовые стекла или царапали машины. Судебные доказательства показывают, что Эмиля ударяли по голове несколько раз. Вы знаете, кто ему угрожал? Да, я знаю."This is because this translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence without distorting it or adding any unnecessary information. It uses appropriate vocabulary and grammar to capture the intended message. Additionally, it maintains the tone and style of the original sentence while being linguistically and culturally appropriate for a Russian audience.
The correct Russian translation is: "Я разобрался со всем. Малышка, ты ведь всё обо мне знала, когда мы поженились. Да, Джонни, я знала, но мои друзья не знали. Моя семья не знала."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "I handled it" is translated as "Я разобрался со всем", which means "I took care of everything".

Конечно, он так и сделал."The correct translation includes "отвёз меня на happy hour" which means "took me to happy hour". Additionally, the correct translation uses "он так и сделал" which means "of course he did" rather than the other options presented.Therefore, the correct Russian translation is: [В чём срочность, мистер Шотт? Она пьяна? Мон-Эл отвёз меня на happy hour. Конечно, он так и сделал.].
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Мне пришлось работать с тем, что было чтобы исполнить клятву и спасти её жизнь... Потому что дверь не открылась. Нет, открылась. Определенно, открылась."This translation is correct because it accurately captures the meaning and context of the original English sentence. The sentence describes a situation where the speaker had to use their knowledge and resources to save someone's life because a door did not open. The speaker then corrects themselves by acknowledging that the door did actually open.The correct translation includes the verb "открылась," which means "opened" in English. This is the correct verb to use in this context because it accurately reflects what happened with the door. The other options provided in the question use different verbs that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Но это не удалось из-за нее. Я имею в виду, что она поторопилась. Вы действительно думаете, что имеет значение? Вы правда так думаете.]This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The translation uses the appropriate verb forms and word choices to express the intended meaning. Specifically, the use of "думаете" (dumayete) meaning "do you think" and "правда так думаете" (pravda tak dumayete) meaning "do you really think so" are the correct phrasings to convey the intended meaning in Russian. The other options either use incorrect verb forms or word choices that do not accurately convey the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Ничего за прошлые 6 недель. Ни в офисе, ни на мобильном или домашнем. Зачем Бернсу звонить с одноразового телефона? Он и не звонил.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, which states that Burns did not call anyone using a burner phone in the past six weeks, and that he did not call anyone at their office, cell phone, or home. The translation uses the correct verb tense and form ("не звонил" means "did not call"), which matches the past tense used in the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Хорошо, спасибо. Но обещания... это всего лишь слова, Чили. Я хочу видеть, как ты добиваешься здесь успеха. Правда хочу."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "I really do" in the English sentence is translated as "Правда хочу" in the Russian sentence, which means "I truly want to." This translation conveys the speaker's sincerity and emphasizes their desire to see the other person succeed.The other options provided in the question do not accurately capture the intended meaning of the original sentence. For example, "Правда делаю" means "I really do it," which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. Similarly, "Правда занимаюсь" means "I really engage in it," which also doesn't convey the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation is: [Судья Чаковски намерен опросить свидетеля? Да, вообще-то. Если ваша честь не возражает. Не возражаю, но предполагаю, вы знаете все причины этого не делать.].This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is confirming that Judge Schakowsky intends to question a witness, and stating that they themselves intend to do so as well, with the caveat that they are aware of the potential reasons not to. The response from the other party confirms that they do not object, but acknowledges that the speaker is aware of the potential issues with questioning the witness. None of the other translations accurately convey this meaning.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я хирург, а не фанатка. Да ладно. Я знаю, ты хочешь увидеть, как я играю. Хочу, да.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. Here's a breakdown of the translation:"Я хирург, а не фанатка." - This translates to "I am a surgeon, not a groupie." It accurately conveys the meaning of the first sentence in the English text."Да ладно." - This is an interjection that can be translated to "Oh come on." It conveys the speaker's attitude of mild disbelief or exasperation, and is an appropriate translation of the second sentence in the English text."Я знаю, ты хочешь увидеть, как я играю." - This translates to "I know you want to see me play." It accurately conveys the meaning of the third sentence in the English text."Хочу, да." - This translates to "I do, actually." It accurately conveys the speaker's affirmation of the desire to be seen playing.None of the other translations accurately capture the meaning of the original English sentence, and some of them introduce new meanings that are not present in the original text. Therefore, the correct translation is the first one.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Но я не хотел. Каким образом ранили её чувства? Я думал, она хотела встречаться со мной. Но она не хотела."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is expressing regret over unintentionally hurting someone's feelings, and is clarifying that they thought the other person was interested in dating them, but they were mistaken. The use of "она не хотела" (she didn't want to) correctly conveys the idea that the other person was not interested in dating the speaker. The other options, which use words like "делала" (did) or "думала" (thought), do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Мезентеральная ишемия, обусловленная курением. Это может быть она. Ты куришь? Моя бабушка курила."This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is suggesting that smoking-related mesenteric ischemia could be the cause of a medical issue, and then asks the listener if they smoke. The speaker then mentions that their grandmother smoked in the past, which could be relevant to the medical issue being discussed. None of the other translations accurately convey this meaning, as they use verbs like "did," "thought," "wanted," "knew," and "helped," which do not fit the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Не о чем здесь разговаривать. Я не буду этого делать. Я понимаю твои чувства и уважаю их. Если бы уважала, тебя бы здесь не было.]This is because the English sentence "If you did, you wouldn't be here" is referring to the other person not respecting the speaker's feelings, and therefore still being present in the situation. The Russian translation "Если бы уважала, тебя бы здесь не было" directly translates to "If you respected (my feelings), you wouldn't be here."The other options do not accurately capture the meaning of the original English sentence. For example, "Если бы делала" (If you did (something)) and "Если бы хотела" (If you wanted) do not convey the same idea as the original sentence. Similarly, "Если бы думала" (If you thought) and "Если бы занималась" (If you were busy with something) do not fit the context of the conversation.
The correct Russian translation is: [- Ты назвала его Джейсоном. - Знаешь что? Я не делала этого. - Да, ты сделала это.].This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentences. The first speaker denies calling the person Jason, but the second speaker insists that she did. The Russian translation conveys this same exchange of dialogue and uses appropriate verb tenses and vocabulary to convey the meaning accurately. The other options use incorrect verb forms or vocabulary that would not convey the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Я знаю, что жертв будет много, но так нужно. Ты же не веришь в это. Ты ничего не слушал из того, что я сказал? Конечно, я слушал, но вы не сможете построить лучший мир, если от него ничего не останется."The correct translation includes "Ты ничего не слушал из того, что я сказал?" instead of "Ты прослушал всё, что я сказал?" in the given options, as the former better captures the speaker's frustration and disbelief that the listener did not heed their words. Additionally, the last sentence is translated as "вы не сможете построить лучший мир" instead of "не получится основать лучший мир," as the former better conveys the meaning that building a better world requires more than just preserving what's left of it.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Ты разделяешь эту команду, когда нам надо работать вместе. Джей-Джей ослушалась приказа, поговорив с тобой, а ты скрываешь информацию. Не я разделил эту команду. Ты сделал.]This translation accurately conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence. The key phrases such as "divided this team," "disobeyed orders," and "withholding information" are appropriately translated. Also, the word "you" is correctly translated as "ты" in Russian.The other options provided contain incorrect translations of the original sentence. For example, in option 3, "Ты захотел" means "You wanted" instead of "You did." Option 5, "Ты занялся" means "You started" instead of "You did," and so on.Therefore, option 2 is the correct Russian translation of the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Будто ты наказываешь меня за излечение. Я думала, что мы хорошо работаем вместе, и ты тоже. В команде. Я так думал.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The sentence talks about the speaker's perception of their relationship with the person they are speaking to. They thought they were working well together and that the other person shared that perception, but now it feels like the other person is punishing them for something they cannot control.The key phrase in the sentence that determines the correct translation is "I did," which in Russian would be "Я так думал." This phrase indicates the speaker's past perception of the situation and reinforces the idea that they thought they were working well together, but now that perception has been shattered. The other options either use the wrong verb tense or the wrong verb altogether, which changes the meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Требовала что? Побольше 'секретного соуса', как говорят дети. Дети так уже не говорят, дедушка. А я думал, что говорят."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is expressing a desire for more of the "secret sauce," which they describe as something that "the kids say." However, another character points out that kids don't actually say that phrase anymore. The final line indicates that the speaker was under the impression that kids still used the phrase.None of the other translations accurately convey this meaning, as they use different verbs or phrases that do not match the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [А в какую школу ты ходил? Какое-то время в школу Джефферсона. В каком году закончил? Я не закончил.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first part of the translation asks "Which school did you go to?", which corresponds to the English sentence "Where'd you go to high school?". The second part of the translation states "For a while to Jefferson school", which is a reasonable translation of "Jefferson for a while". The third part of the translation asks "In which year did you finish?", which corresponds to the English sentence "What year did you graduate?". The final part of the translation states "I didn't finish", which accurately conveys the meaning of "I didn't".The other translations do not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence, as they use different verbs or phrases that do not match the meaning of the English words.
The correct translation is: "Я думал, ты бросил меня. Я же сказал, что вернусь? Действительно? Да, сказал."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence, where the speaker thought the other person had left them, but the other person had actually said they were coming back. The word "сказал" means "said" in Russian, which is the appropriate verb to use in this context to convey that the other person had communicated their intention to return. The other options use verbs that do not fit the context or change the meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Среди пропавших не числится. Проверьте школы и колледжи. - Ищите отсутствующих последние два дня. - Я займусь."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is suggesting that the Missing Persons search did not yield any results, and so they should try looking for the missing individuals in schools and colleges. They then ask if there have been any absences in the last two days, to which the response is "will do", indicating that they will check. The phrase "will do" can be accurately translated as "я займусь", which means "I will take care of it" or "I will handle it".
The correct Russian translation is: "Хорошо? Хорошо. Я купил пару стейков. Нет, не купил."This is because the sentence "No, you didn't" is a negative response to the previous statement "I picked up a couple steaks", indicating that the speaker did not actually buy the steaks. The correct translation of "didn't" in this context is "не купил" which means "did not buy". The other options such as "не сделал" (did not do), "не захотел" (did not want to), or "не подумал" (did not think) do not convey the same meaning as "did not buy".
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Моя дочь уже говорила вам, что была внутри магазина. Она не видела, что происходило снаружи. Ума, я понимаю, ты видела как убили человека, я знаю, насколько это ужасно. Поверь, я знаю.]This is because the correct Russian translation accurately conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence. The sentence structure, grammar, and vocabulary used in the correct Russian translation are appropriate and precise. Specifically, "Believe me, I do" in the English sentence is translated into "Поверь, я знаю" in the Russian translation, which conveys the same meaning accurately.All the other options have incorrect or inappropriate translations of the original English sentence. For example, some of the options have incorrect verb conjugations or use inappropriate words that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[– Пабло вернулся домой. – Похоже на то. Будем надеяться, что он и завтра им позвонит. Позвонит – мы будем слушать.]This translation is correct because it accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The English sentence states that Pablo has come home, and the speaker thinks he will speak to "them" (presumably someone he knows) again tomorrow. The speaker then says "If he does, we'll be listening," indicating that they will be paying attention to what he says.The Russian translation reflects this meaning by using the verb "позвонит," which means "will call," to indicate that Pablo will contact "them" tomorrow. The phrase "мы будем слушать" is used to indicate that the speaker will be listening. Therefore, this translation correctly conveys the meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Я вас не знаю, и не собираюсь подчиняться чьим-то приказам. Особенно, приказам какого-то белоручки-англичашки. Не уверен, что вы меня поняли, друг мой. Да нет, понял."This is because the correct translation should accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence, and the given option is the only one that uses the correct Russian word for "understand" (понял). The other options use various other Russian verbs such as сделал (did), захотел (wanted), подумал (thought), занялся (started), поступил (behaved), помог (helped), and сказал (said), which do not accurately convey the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[- Хорошо. Потому что я не хочу здесь больше находиться. Я знаю, ты хочешь уничтожить его за то, что он с тобой сделал. Мы все хотим и мы это сделаем.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence in English. The verb "хотим" (khotim) in the last sentence means "we want", which is the appropriate verb in this context. The other options provided contain verbs that do not fit the context or are grammatically incorrect, such as "делаем" (delayem) which means "we do" and does not convey the sense of desire, or "помогаем" (pomogayem) which means "we help" and is not appropriate in this context.
The correct translation is: "Я не мог победить Соловара в бою, но ты смог. Ты это сделал, и теперь я управляю городом Горилл, и все гориллы будут следовать за мной. Соловар никогда не хотел нападать на Централ Сити. Ты хотел."This is because the verb "wanted" in the English sentence is in the past tense, which in Russian is expressed as "хотел" (khotel). The other options given do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "Ты делал" (Ty delal) means "you did" but does not specify what action was taken, and "Ты думал" (Ty dumal) means "you thought" but does not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
None of the provided options is a correct translation of the English sentence given.The correct translation of the English sentence would be: "Большая сторона. Так, как насчёт девушки из спортзала? Собираешься снова пригласить её на свидание? Я уже пригласил."This is because "Big side" doesn't make sense as a standalone phrase, but "big" can be translated as "большая" and "side" as "сторона". Additionally, "girl from the gym" is translated as "девушка из спортзала" and "ask her out" as "пригласить её на свидание". The correct translation for "already did" in this context is "я уже пригласил" which means "I already did".
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Даже у бассейна прибыль меньше, что по-моему объясняется недавней активностью местного криминала затронувшей домик с надувашками. Что случилось с моим домиком с надувашками? Думала, ты не хочешь, чтобы все знали, что ты его спонсировал. Я и не хочу, но это мой домик с надувашками.]
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Конечно, нет, потому что ты знаешь, что она покажет нам, что ты врешь. Диаз приказал тебе убить Миранду Гиббс? Я не понимаю, о чем вы говорите. Конечно, понимаешь.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence in Russian. The other options include incorrect or inappropriate verb forms or meanings that do not match the context of the sentence. For example, "делаешь" and "сделаешь" both mean "do" or "make," but they do not fit in the sentence because the speaker is asking if the listener knows something, not if they are doing something. Similarly, "хочешь" means "want" and "занимаешься" means "occupy oneself with," but neither of these verbs make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct translation is the one that accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence while using appropriate grammar and vocabulary.
The correct Russian translation is: "Я принес идею, которой не нужен патент. Идею, которая изменит мир. Я не вижу ничего, что могло бы изменить мир, в том, что ты делаешь, Сайлас. Но ты изменить его сможешь."This translation captures the meaning of the English sentence accurately. The first sentence translates to "I brought an idea that doesn't need a patent. An idea that will change the world." The second sentence translates to "I don't see anything world-altering about what you're doing, Silas." The third sentence translates to "Oh, you will do."The other options provided in the question are not accurate translations of the original sentence because they do not accurately capture the intended meaning. For example, "захотите" means "you will want to," which is not the same as "you will do." Similarly, "поймете" means "you will understand," which does not convey the idea of "you will do."
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Даже если бы я сообщил, это не имело бы значения. Слишком мало принятия мер в системе. Вы это знаете. Да, я знаю.]This is because the translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original sentence. The Russian sentence correctly conveys that even if the speaker had reported something, it would not have made a difference because the system has very little follow-up. The following sentence confirms that the listener knows this to be true, and responds with "Yes, I know."The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence. For example, "Да, я делаю" (Yes, I do) and "Да, я хочу" (Yes, I want) do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Similarly, "Да, я занимаюсь" (Yes, I am busy) and "Да, я помогаю" (Yes, I am helping) do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct translation is: [Он был очень... милым. Вы занимались сексом? Нет. Занимались.].This translation accurately reflects the original meaning of the English sentence, where the first speaker denies having had sex with the person being referred to as "very sweet," but the second speaker contradicts them and says that they did have sex. The word "занимались" in the translation means "had sex" in this context. The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Это мой хлеб. Они даже ещё не знают, что случилось. А ты знаешь, что случилось? А кто-нибудь знает?].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The phrase "I do this for a living" is translated as "Это мой хлеб" which means "This is my bread and butter" or "I make a living doing this." The phrase "They don't even know what happened yet" is translated as "Они даже ещё не знают, что случилось" which means "They don't even know what happened yet." The questions "I mean do you know what happened? Does... does anyone?" are translated as "А ты знаешь, что случилось? А кто-нибудь знает?" which means "Do you know what happened? Does anyone know?"
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "А не подкупили. Но это атака, как не посмотри. И действовать нужно быстро. Ты займешься." This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which is that the speaker wants the listener to take action quickly because they believe an attack is happening. The verb "займёшься" (zaymesh'sya) means "take care of" or "deal with," which fits well in the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning or use incorrect verb forms or tenses.
The correct Russian translation is: [Это невозможно. Она бы не бросила меня. Ну, она могла бы подумать, что ты умер. Мы подумали.]This is because the translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker expresses disbelief that someone they cared about would leave them, but then considers the possibility that the person may have thought the speaker was dead. The final sentence indicates that the speaker and others with them also considered this possibility. The chosen translation uses appropriate verb forms and vocabulary to convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is:[Его деятельность подорвана. Нашли ли они Фиггиса? Нет еще, но они уверены, что найдут. И когда найдут, детектив Пименто сможет вернуться домой.]Out of the options provided, none of them provide an accurate translation of the English sentence.

Я знаю, что любил.]This translation captures the meaning of the original sentence accurately. The phrase "And obviously, a very fond farewell" is translated as "И очевидно, нежное прощание," which means "And obviously, a tender farewell." The phrase "(scoffs) That's unbelievable" is translated as "(ухмыляется) Невероятно," which means "(smirks) Unbelievable." The phrase "I loved her, Tim. I know you did" is translated as "Я любил её, Тим. Я знаю, что любил," which means "I loved her, Tim. I know I did."The other options provided in the question use various verbs such as "делал" (did), "хотел" (wanted), "думал" (thought), "занимался" (occupied oneself), "знал" (knew), "мог" (could), "поступал" (acted), "помогал" (helped), "понимал" (understood), and "говорил" (said), which do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence. Therefore, they are not the correct translations for the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is "Он исправился. Он заслужил второй шанс. И семью. Они оба этого заслужили" because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original sentence. The sentence talks about a person who has reformed and deserves a second chance and a family, and both the person and their partner deserve it. The chosen translation accurately conveys this message, while the other options either use different verbs that don't match the context or imply different meanings that are not present in the original sentence.
The correct translation of the English sentence into Russian is: "Нет, не ладно. Вы были правы. Я устала, но я должна научиться справляться с этим. Ты научилась."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is acknowledging that they were wrong and the other person was right. They explain that they were tired, but they recognize the need to learn how to push past it, and they commend the other person for having already learned how to do so. The verb "научилась" (learned) in the last sentence appropriately reflects the past tense and feminine gender of the subject "ты" (you).
The correct Russian translation is: [маленького серебряного колокольчика. ... шесть жертв с 1999 по 2002, затем убийства внезапно прекратились, а дело заглохло. Многие из вас помнят ужас, который охватил наш город в то время. Я точно знаю.].This is because the sentence is discussing the speaker's personal recollection of the terror that gripped the city during the time of the murders. The verb "знаю" (know) accurately conveys the idea that the speaker remembers the events and is certain of their recollection. The other verbs, such as "делаю" (do), "хочу" (want), "думаю" (think), "занимаюсь" (occupy oneself), "могу" (can), "поступаю" (act), "помогаю" (help), "понимаю" (understand), and "говорю" (speak) do not accurately convey the same idea as "знаю" in this context.
The correct Russian translation is: [Все мои оперативники остались вне подозрений. Утечка была не в МИ-6, утечка была в МорПоле. А почему вы не передали эту информацию Морроу? Я передала.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The verb "передала" in the Russian translation corresponds to the English verb "relayed", which is the correct translation in this context. The other options use incorrect verbs or verb forms that do not convey the intended meaning.
Based on the context and grammar of the English sentence, the correct Russian translation would be:[Да. Там было либо это - либо раздаться на две тысячи. - Нет, ты этого не сделал.]This translation conveys the meaning of the original sentence in a way that makes sense in Russian. Specifically:"Yeah" is translated as "да" which is an affirmative response in Russian."It was either that - or fork over two grand" is translated as "Там было либо это - либо раздаться на две тысячи." This accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence, which is that the speaker had two options: either do something (which is not specified in the sentence) or pay two thousand dollars."- No, you didn't" is translated as "Нет, ты этого не сделал." This accurately conveys the negative response given by the speaker, indicating that the listener did not choose the first option mentioned in the previous sentence.The other options provided in the question either use incorrect vocabulary or grammar, or convey a different meaning than the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: [Сдай кровь, доброволец. Не становись похожим на козлов, снимающих это. Хорошая работа, парень. Намного лучше того, что делала я.].This is because the phrase "Better than I did" indicates that the speaker is comparing the actions of the person they are addressing to their own actions, suggesting that they did not perform as well as the person they are addressing. The most appropriate Russian translation to convey this comparison is "Намного лучше того, что делала я," which means "much better than what I did." The other options do not convey this comparison or use appropriate verb forms or phrases.
The correct Russian translation is: [И я понимаю, что если бы я сама это сделала, это было бы ненормально, но я не сумасшедшая. Вы желали ей смерти. Ну... Нет, не хотела.]This is because the phrase "You wished she was dead" is in the past tense, and the verb "желать" (to wish) should also be in the past tense to match the tense of the sentence. Out of the given options, the only one that correctly conjugates the verb "желать" in the past tense for the feminine singular form (since "she" is being referred to) is "не хотела" which means "did not want". Therefore, the correct translation is option 3.
The correct Russian translation is: [Он волновался. Не в её стиле вот так просто не прийти. Он постоянно ей звонил. Мы все делали.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The sentence "He was concerned" is translated as "Он волновался", which means the same thing. The phrase "It wasn't like her to just not show up" is translated as "Не в её стиле вот так просто не прийти", which means "It's not like her to just not show up like that". The sentence "He called her a bunch of times. We all did" is translated as "Он постоянно ей звонил. Мы все делали", which means "He constantly called her. We all did."The other options include translations such as "We all thought", "We all knew", "We all helped", and "We all spoke", which do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. Therefore, the correct translation is [Он волновался. Не в её стиле вот так просто не прийти. Он постоянно ей звонил. Мы все делали.].
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Как ты можешь спрашивать об этом? Конечно, да! Я только и делаю, что воспроизвожу это снова и снова в своей голове, пытаясь понять, как я мог бы изменить это. Конечно, да!".None of the provided translations is an exact match for the given English sentence, as they contain different verbs or adjectives than the original sentence. Therefore, none of them can be considered as the correct translation.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Привет. Кажется, пришло время нам с тобой сесть и поговорить об убийце, которого ты разыскиваешь. - Я считал, что мы пришли к взаимопониманию. - Пришли."This is because "пришли" is the correct translation of "we did" in this context, which indicates that the two people have previously reached an understanding. The other options provided do not accurately convey the same meaning as "пришли."
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:"Не стоит. Я уверена, что на твоей месте многие поступили бы также. Я проиграла. Не проиграла."This translates back to English as:"Don't be. I'm sure many people would have done the same thing in your place. I failed. No, you didn't."The other options given are incorrect because they use different verbs that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. For example:"Не сделала" means "didn't do" and doesn't capture the meaning of "failed" in the context of the sentence."Не захотела" means "didn't want to" and again, doesn't accurately convey the meaning of "failed"."Не подумала" means "didn't think" and doesn't fit in the context of the sentence."Не узнала" means "didn't find out" and is not appropriate in this context."Не занялась" means "didn't engage in" or "didn't take up" and doesn't capture the meaning of "failed"."Не смогла" means "couldn't" and doesn't convey the nuance of "failed" in this context."Не поступила" means "didn't act" or "didn't behave" and doesn't fit in the context of the sentence."Не помогла" means "didn't help" and is not appropriate in this context."Не поняла" means "didn't understand" and doesn't accurately convey the meaning of "failed"."Не сказала" means "didn't say" and doesn't fit in the context of the sentence.Therefore, only the first option accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Она теперь его. Я бы пока не сбрасывал предыдущего владельца со счетов. Думаете, Робби вернётся? Прошлый Призрачный гонщик вернулся.]This is because the verb "did" in the original English sentence refers to an action that has already been completed, which would be translated to the past tense in Russian. The verb "вернулся" in the correct translation is the past tense form of the verb "вернуться," which means "to return." This accurately reflects the meaning of the original sentence, which implies that the previous Ghost Rider returned.The other options contain different verbs that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence, such as "сделал" (did), "захотел" (wanted), "подумал" (thought), "занялся" (took up), "узнал" (learned), "смог" (was able to), "поступил" (behaved), "помог" (helped), and "понял" (understood).
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Просто взрыв красок, как гавайский замороженный лёд. Знаю, что патологоанатомы любят сравнения с едой. Да, мы это делаем.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, which is "Just an explosion of colors, like Hawaiian shave ice. Hm. I know how you pathologists love food references. Yes, we do."The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence. For example:Option 2 (мы это хотим) translates to "we want it" which does not make sense in this context.Option 4 (мы это думаем) translates to "we think it" which also does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.Option 6 (мы это знаем) translates to "we know it" which is close to the correct translation but does not capture the nuance of "we love it".Option 7 (мы это можем) translates to "we can do it" which is not an accurate translation of the intended meaning.Option 8 (мы это поступаем) translates to "we do it" which is also not an accurate translation in this context.Option 9 (мы это помогаем) translates to "we help it" which does not make sense in this context.Option 10 (мы это понимаем) translates to "we understand it" which is close to the correct translation but does not capture the nuance of "we love it".Option 11 (мы это говорим) translates to "we say it" which is not an accurate translation in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: [И она была права. То есть ты приехал туда, искал его, но не смог найти, верно? Да. Так нашел человек из группировки Лаури, а также тот, кто помог Дэнни убить его человека.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence, including the use of "Lowry's guy" to refer to a person affiliated with the Lowry group, and the use of "whoever" to indicate that the identity of the person who helped Danny is unknown.The other translations provided contain errors in grammar or vocabulary that make them incorrect. For example, the use of the verb "сделал" (did/made) in the second option, or "захотел" (wanted) in the third option, do not accurately convey the sense of "whoever helped Danny kill Lowry's guy."
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Рейчел, мы это обсуждали. После выпуска ты предстанешь перед коллегией адвокатов, чтобы пройти испытание на профпригодность. И ты думаешь, что работа в твоей фирме выглядит лучше, чем работа в моей. Да, думаю.]This translation is correct because "да, думаю" translates to "Yes, I do" in English, which is the correct response to the question asked in the original sentence. The other options have translations that do not match the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Это было жестоко. Никто, никто не смог бы пережить это... Знаешь что? Она смогла.]This is because "she survived" in the English sentence implies that she was able to survive despite the violence, which indicates that she was strong or lucky enough to survive. Out of the given options, the only one that conveys this meaning is "она смогла," which means "she was able to" or "she managed to."The other options such as "она захотела" (she wanted to), "она узнала" (she found out), "она помогла" (she helped), etc. do not convey the same meaning as "she survived," and thus are not appropriate translations for the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Нет, я... смогу отложить это на несколько дней. Всё равно нужно повидать маму. - Ты вроде говорила, что не хочешь. - Не хочу, но нужно.].This translation accurately reflects the meaning and tone of the original English sentence. The speaker is saying that they can delay something for a few days if necessary, but they should still see their mother. When asked about it, they admit that they don't want to see their mother but feel that they should. The other options provided do not accurately reflect the original meaning of the sentence and would result in a different understanding of the speaker's intent.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:"Уэс, твои захватчики свели тебя с ума. Как ты можешь говорить мне такое? Они сами напросились. Все сами напросились."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "they had it coming" is translated as "они сами напросились," which means "they brought it upon themselves" or "they asked for it." The other options provided are not accurate translations of this phrase and do not convey the same meaning as the original sentence. Therefore, the correct translation is the first option.
The correct Russian translation is: [Нет. Ну разумеется, нет. Ты же хочешь жить, правда? Хочу.].This is because the phrase "I do" in the original English sentence is a simple and direct response to the question "You want to live, don't you?" Therefore, the best translation would be a direct and simple response to the same question in Russian, which is "Хочу" (I want to).
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Доктор"? Коновал! Мы чуть не потеряли их обоих. Но, спасибо Господу, не потеряли же.This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, which is a statement of relief that both people were not lost. "Доктор"? Коновал! is an idiomatic expression in Russian that can be translated to "Doctor"? Sawbones! in English, indicating surprise or shock. The rest of the translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, with the use of the negative particle "не" to indicate that the outcome of not losing the people is seen as a positive one.
The correct Russian translation is: [Это дело никак не связано с моей матерью. Просто адвокат, извалял её имя в грязи, пытаясь достать меня. Вы сказали, что знаете, кто её убил. Да, я знаю.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The other options provided have various grammatical errors or incorrect vocabulary choices, making them incorrect translations. For example, "я делаю" (I do) and "я хочу" (I want) are not appropriate translations for "I do" in this context. Similarly, "я думаю" (I think), "я занимаюсь" (I am engaged in), "я могу" (I can), "я поступаю" (I am enrolling), "я помогаю" (I am helping), "я понимаю" (I understand), and "я говорю" (I am speaking) do not accurately convey the meaning of the sentence in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Я только что это сделал. То, что ты делаешь – это ошибка. Я так не считаю, и Донна не считает, так что... Вообще-то, Харви, я так считаю.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is stating that they have just run something by the person they are speaking to, and that what the other person is doing is a mistake. They then go on to say that they and Donna do not think it is a mistake, but they are then contradicted, with the speaker stating that they do think it is a mistake.The other options provided as translations use words and phrases that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "я так делаю" means "I do it this way" and "я так хочу" means "I want it this way", which do not fit the context of the sentence. Similarly, "я так помогаю" means "I help this way" and "я так говорю" means "I say this way", which do not make sense in the given context. Therefore, the correct translation is option 1, "я так считаю" which means "I think so."
The correct Russian translation is: "МакЛауглан мёртв? Честерфилд забрал деньги. Он вас не видел? Не видел, и мы замели следы."This translation accurately reflects the content and meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is asking about MacLaughlan's death and then confirms that Chesterfield took the money back. The speaker then asks if Chesterfield saw them, to which the response is that he did not see them, and they covered their tracks. The other translations provided use incorrect verbs or tenses that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [- Это я! - Боже мой! Только не говори, что не помнишь меня! - Конечно, помню.].This is because the Russian words used in this translation accurately convey the same meaning as the English words. The speaker is exclaiming that it is them and expressing surprise that the listener doesn't remember them. The listener then confirms that they do remember the speaker. The other options provided use words that do not accurately convey the same meaning as the English words and would not be appropriate translations for this sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Ну 20 ему уже есть, так что обвинение ему предъявят, как взрослому. Вопрос в том, откуда ты его знаешь? Ну, лично я его не знаю. А вот я знаю и я не буду выдвигать обвинений.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The other translations are incorrect because they use words and phrases that do not fit in the context of the sentence. For example, in the second option, "делаю" means "doing" which does not make sense in the context. Similarly, in the third option, "хочу" means "want" which also does not fit in the context. In the other options, "думаю" (thinking), "занимаюсь" (doing), "могу" (can), "поступаю" (acting), "помогаю" (helping), "понимаю" (understand), and "говорю" (saying) also do not fit in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is:[Что если мне удастся убрать наши имена с могильных плит, которые для нас создал Аид, тех самых, что держат нас здесь. Я искала подобное заклинание. Оно не существует. Вообще-то, существует.]This is because the word "actually" in the English sentence can be translated as "вообще-то" in Russian, which indicates a correction or addition to a previous statement. The other options provided do not convey this meaning correctly.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Если ты этого не делал, то ты не потеряешь свою работу. Мне нужно идти на работу. Нет, не нужно. Мне нужно."This translation is different from all the options provided in the question. The key differences between this translation and the options provided are:The verb form "делал" is used instead of "делала". This is because the subject of the sentence is masculine (referring to "you" which can be either male or female), and the correct form of the verb to agree with the subject is masculine.The last sentence is translated as "Мне нужно" which means "I need to" or "I have to". This is more accurate than any of the options provided, which use different verbs like "думаю" (think), "хочу" (want), "знаю" (know), etc.Therefore, the correct translation of the given sentence is the first option provided in the question with the following corrections: "делала" should be changed to "делал" and the last sentence should be translated as "Мне нужно".
The correct translation is: "Остановить их - наш главный приоритет. Я все это понимаю, Элизабет! Я... Правда понимаю."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is saying that stopping "them" is their first priority and that they understand this. The word "понимаю" means "understand" in Russian, which is the appropriate verb to use in this context. The other options, such as "делаю" (do), "хочу" (want), or "думаю" (think) do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Всё записано. А даже если бы и нет, мы бы не помогли Эрику, если бы стали врать. Вы должны были прикрыть его. Мы так и сделали."This is because the translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence, which is talking about a recorded incident and the importance of telling the truth and supporting Eric. The translation uses the appropriate verb "сделали" (did) to convey the message that the speaker and his/her group followed through on their promise to support Eric, while also emphasizing the importance of being truthful.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Что ты сказал? Ничего. Что я не знаю. Но он сказал, что если я сделаю это, я не должен бояться, и он позаботится о том, чтобы у меня все было в порядке.]The reason for this is that this translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. The key phrase in the sentence is "if I did," which refers to a hypothetical action that the speaker may or may not have done. The phrase "сделаю это" in the correct translation captures this meaning more accurately than the other options presented, which use different verbs that do not convey the same sense of a hypothetical action.Additionally, the correct translation uses the phrase "он позаботится о том," which accurately conveys the sense of the original sentence that the person mentioned will take care of the speaker if they do the hypothetical action. The other options presented use different phrases that do not capture this nuance as effectively.Overall, the correct translation is the most accurate and captures the intended meaning of the original sentence most effectively.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Мистера Беренсона не было на встрече, но его отчет называл доказательства заключительными. Действительно? Он использовал это слово - "заключительные"? По словам мистера Адала, да.]This translation captures the meaning of the original sentence accurately. The word "conclusive" in the English sentence is translated as "заключительными" in Russian, which is a more appropriate term to convey the meaning of "conclusive evidence." The other options provided for the translation contain various errors, including incorrect verb tenses, incorrect words, or incorrect verb forms, which result in incorrect translations that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Перебрал с выпивкой и... Я сделал это ненамеренно, но я изменил ей. Хочешь поговорить об этом? Только что поговорили."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence in Russian. The other options presented do not accurately reflect the meaning of the English sentence. For example, "Только что сделали" would translate to "just did," which does not convey the idea of talking about the situation, and "Только что захотели" would translate to "just wanted," which also does not accurately reflect the idea of having a conversation about the situation. Therefore, the correct translation is the one that accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which is "Только что поговорили."
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Тебе нужно поспать. Позвони, когда закончишь с работой. Может сходим в кино, чтобы компенсировать потерянное время? Сходим.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. Here's a breakdown of each sentence and why the given translation is correct:"You should hit the hay." = "Тебе нужно поспать." The translation accurately conveys the idea of "you should go to sleep.""Call me when you finish work." = "Позвони, когда закончишь с работой." The translation correctly translates the phrase "call me" and the verb tense."Maybe we can catch a movie, make up for lost time?" = "Может сходим в кино, чтобы компенсировать потерянное время?" The translation accurately captures the idea of seeing a movie and making up for lost time."Will do." = "Сходим." This is a colloquial way to say "OK, let's do it" or "I agree," which the translation captures well.None of the other given translations accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Но, безусловно, сейчас ты должен быть со своим бедным отцом? Да, я как раз шел к нему. Но решил сначала заглянуть к вам. Я так рада, что ты зашел, мой милый Пьер!]This is because "зашел" (zashel) is the correct Russian word for "look in on" or "drop by," which is the intended meaning in this context. The other options provided use different verbs that do not accurately convey the same meaning as the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the English sentence is: [В пустыне? Это было очень давно. Нас застукали в джакузи, и тот парень очень разозлился. Помню.]. This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. "Помню" means "I remember" in English, which is a suitable translation for "I do" at the end of the English sentence. The other options presented do not convey the same meaning and do not fit in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Когда найдём деньги, об этом можно будет забыть. И когда это случится? Эти идиоты ничего не знают. Нет, но они назвали того, кто знает.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The translation means: "When we find the money, you can forget about it. And when will that happen? These idiots don't know anything. No, but they gave me the name of someone who does."The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning of the English sentence. For example, the options that use verbs like "делает" (does), "хочет" (wants), "думает" (thinks), "занимается" (is engaged in), "может" (can), "поступает" (acts), "помогает" (helps), "понимает" (understands), or "говорит" (speaks) do not accurately reflect the idea of someone who knows about the money. Therefore, they are not correct translations for the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Во всё. Может было бы лучше, если мы тебе никогда и ничего не рассказали о той ночи, когда Данхилл погиб, и... Я не должна была просить тебя помочь мне разорвать его квитанции по кредитной карте. Но ты сделала."This is because "сделала" (pronounced "sdelala") is the correct form of the verb "to do" in the past tense for the feminine gender. In the sentence, the subject is "you," which refers to a female person, so "сделала" is the correct form of the verb to use.The other options are incorrect because they use the wrong form of the verb, such as "захотела" (wanted) which is not appropriate in the context of the sentence, or they use verbs that are not applicable in this context, such as "узнала" (found out) or "смогла" (was able to).
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я бы предпочёл сойти с ума. Ладно. Я попрошу "Уорлд" удалить это. И если они не сделают этого, мы обратимся к временному судебному запрету.]This translation captures the meaning of the original sentence most accurately. The first option ("и если они сделают") suggests that the speaker expects The World to comply with the request, which is not necessarily the case. The other options use words that are not appropriate in this context, such as "займутся" (get busy), "узнают" (find out), "смогут" (be able to), "помогут" (help), or "поймут" (understand).The correct translation, on the other hand, uses the negative particle "не" to indicate that the speaker anticipates The World might not comply with the request, and therefore, an interim injunction may be necessary. This accurately reflects the tone and intention of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Они были исключительно близки. В другой эпохе они, возможно, начали бы фирму вместе. Но вы выбрали Уилла на должность клерка, а не Клиффа. Я сделала это."This is because the Russian translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The word choices and grammar used in the translation also convey the same tone and intent as the English sentence.The other options presented in the question contain different verbs or verb tenses that change the meaning of the sentence or do not match the context. For example, "захотела" (wanted) and "смогла" (managed) do not fit the context of the sentence, and "узнала" (found out) and "помогла" (helped) do not match the meaning of the English sentence. Therefore, they are not the correct translations of the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Уверен, у тебя есть ответы. А я тут посижу, поворчу. Вы знаете, каков протокол для туберкулёза? Вообще-то, знаю.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. The sentence begins with "Уверен, у тебя есть ответы" which translates to "I'm sure you have all the answers." The following phrase "А я тут посижу, поворчу" translates to "I'll just be over here, all gnarled up." The next sentence "Вы знаете, каков протокол для туберкулёза?" translates to "Do you know what the TB protocol is?" The final sentence "Вообще-то, знаю" translates to "Well, in fact, I do." This translation accurately conveys the meaning and tone of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Я ненадолго. Посмотри-ка. Никогда не видел тебя обнаженной. Уверена, что видел, просто не помнишь."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. The phrase "I ain't gonna be long" is translated as "Я ненадолго" which means "I won't be long." The phrase "Look at you" is translated as "Посмотри-ка," which is an informal way of saying "Look." The phrase "I ain't never seen you naked like this before" is translated as "Никогда не видел тебя обнаженной," which means "I've never seen you naked." The phrase "Sure you did, only you don't remember" is translated as "Уверена, что видел, просто не помнишь," which means "I'm sure you did, you just don't remember."The other options provided do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence. For example, options such as "Уверена, что делал" (I'm sure you did it) or "Уверена, что занимался" (I'm sure you were busy) do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Я мистер спикер, и люди приходят ко мне за чем-то. Не имеет значения, это соперник или союзник или старый друг из школы-интерната. Я не знал, что собирался делать Клэй. Ну что ж, если вы не знали, то должны были знать."Out of the given options, the correct translation is the first one: "Я мистер спикер, и люди приходят ко мне зачем-то. Не имеет значения, это соперник или союзник или школьные приятели. Я не знал, что задумал Клэй. А следовало бы узнать."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. It conveys that the speaker is Mr. Speaker and people come to him for some reason, regardless of whether they are rivals, allies, or old friends from boarding school. The speaker did not know what Clay was planning to do, but he should have known. The use of the verb "узнать" in the last sentence means "to know" or "to find out," which is the correct translation in this context. The other options do not convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [У вас же есть глаза, да? Вы видите, что я не ребенок, и я определенно не ваш сын, так что не называй меня "сынком". Не уверен, что ты понимаешь, куда ты попал, сынок. Вообще-то, знаю.]This is because "знаю" (know) is the correct translation for "actually, I do" in this context. The other options provided are incorrect translations for the phrase "actually, I do." For example, "делаю" means "do," "хочу" means "want," "думаю" means "think," "занимаюсь" means "occupy oneself with," "могу" means "can," "поступаю" means "enter," "помогаю" means "help," "понимаю" means "understand," and "говорю" means "speak." None of these translations accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Пусть сдаст оружие и покинет здание до дальнейшего уведомления. В этом нет необходимости. Вы не можете этого сделать. Только что сделал."This is because the phrase "I just did" in the English sentence implies that the speaker has already surrendered their weapon and left the building, which is reflected in the Russian translation "Только что сделал" meaning "just did". The other options do not convey this meaning accurately.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Так что держи этого Чарльза Понци и его потаскушку подальше от меня. Мы, Майеры, очень находчивы. Ты ведь знаешь, что на самом деле ты - не член моей семьи, да? - Знаю.]This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided are incorrect because they use different verbs that do not accurately capture the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "делаю" (option 2) means "doing" which does not fit in the context of the sentence, "хочу" (option 3) means "want" which also does not fit the context, and so on. Only the verb "знаю" (option 1) accurately conveys the meaning of "I do" in the original sentence, which means "I am aware" or "I understand."
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:"Таков был твой план? Я просто увидел возможность получить расположение у Хана и воспользовался ею. Я почти погиб. Но ты нет, Марко, ты выжил."Out of the options given, this is not an exact match to any of them. The correct translation conveys the same meaning as the English sentence while maintaining correct grammar and syntax in Russian.Option 1 is mostly correct, but the phrase "оказать Хану услугу" (to do a favor for the Khan) is a better translation than "оказать Хану пользу" (to be of benefit to the Khan).Option 2 uses the wrong verb form for "you didn't" ("не сделал же" instead of "не погиб же").Option 3 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не захотел").Option 4 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не подумал").Option 5 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не занялся").Option 6 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не смог").Option 7 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не поступил").Option 8 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не помог").Option 9 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не понял").Option 10 uses the wrong verb form for "you survived" ("ты выжил" instead of "ты не сказал").
The correct Russian translation is:[Всё будет хорошо. Ты просто должен говорить правду. Они мне не поверят. Никто не верит.]This is the most accurate translation because it captures the meaning of the original sentence. Here's a breakdown of each part:"Всё будет хорошо" means "everything will be all right," which is a direct translation of "It is going to be all right.""Ты просто должен говорить правду" means "you just have to tell the truth," which accurately conveys the message in the original sentence."Они мне не поверят" means "they won't believe me," which is a direct translation of that part of the sentence."Никто не верит" means "nobody believes," which accurately captures the meaning of "Nobody does."The other options have various inaccuracies in their translations of "Nobody does," such as "nobody knows," "nobody wants," or "nobody helps." These translations change the meaning of the sentence and do not accurately convey the original message.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Я проходила через самый болезненный период моей жизни в одиночку. Засыпая, я каждую ночь плакала. И как идиотка, я просыпалась, думая, надеясь, что на следующий день ты появишься у моей двери. Но ты никогда не приходил."
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Рози, могу я дать тебе один совет? Перестань ныть. Я не ною. Нет, ноешь.]This is because the phrase "Yes, you do" is a response to the statement "I don't whine." In the correct translation, "Нет, ноешь" (No, you whine) is the appropriate response to indicate that the person being addressed (Rosie) actually does whine, contrary to their earlier statement.The other options given in the multiple-choice question do not convey the same meaning and are not appropriate translations in this context. For example, "Нет, делаешь" (No, you do) and "Нет, хочешь" (No, you want) do not convey the same sense of contradiction as "No, you whine." Similarly, "Нет, занимаешься" (No, you're busy) and "Нет, знаешь" (No, you know) do not fit the context of the conversation.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Мою мать. Она не идет у меня из головы. Она всегда хотела этого для меня. А я разбил ей сердце, потому что сам не хотел.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is talking about their mother and how she always wanted something for them, but the speaker did not want it and as a result, broke her heart. The verb "want" is translated as "хотела" which is the correct past tense form in Russian. The verb "broke" is translated as "разбил" which is the correct past tense form of the verb in Russian. The verb "didn't" is translated as "не хотел" which means "did not want" in Russian. This translation also uses the correct possessive form "мою мать" which means "my mother" in Russian.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Как звали этого мальчика? Эрик. Монстры не запоминают имена. Девочки скауты запоминают." This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is asking for the name of the boy, and then stating that monsters don't remember names while Girl Scouts do. The word "запоминают" in the translation means "remember" which is the appropriate verb to use in this context, while the other verbs suggested in the options don't fit the context or meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the sentence is: "Она оглянулась. Сердце дрогнуло... Я не заслуживаю прощения. Нет, заслуживаешь."This is because the response "Нет, заслуживаешь" means "No, you do" which is the appropriate response to "I don't deserve to be forgiven". The other options such as "делаешь" (do), "хочешь" (want), "думаешь" (think), "занимаешься" (occupy oneself), "знаешь" (know), "можешь" (can), "поступаешь" (act), "помогаешь" (help), "понимаешь" (understand), and "говоришь" (speak) are not appropriate in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "размытыми и говорящими, как Зул. Значит миссия выполнена? А Рейган тебе ничего не говорила? Да, она, вообще-то, сказала."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The sentence is about someone who is talking in a blurry manner, like the character Zuul from the movie Ghostbusters. The speaker then asks if the mission has been accomplished, and whether Reagan (presumably a person in the context of the conversation) said anything. The response is that Reagan did, in fact, say something.The other options provided in the question contain different verbs in place of "сказала" (said). These options do not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence, and therefore are not correct translations.
The correct Russian translation is: "Не понимаю. Не волнуйся, детка. Ты ничего не делала. Это сделала я."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is reassuring the child that they didn't do anything wrong and that the responsibility for whatever happened rests on the speaker. The phrase "Это сделала я" clearly communicates this idea by indicating that "I" did whatever needs to be done, rather than the child.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Похоже, мир ещё не знает, что делать с альфа-самками. Вот поэтому мы - альфа-самки, должны взять всё в свои руки. Хотите купить мой паршивый старый трейлер? Хочу. "This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided do not convey the same meaning, as they use different verbs (such as "делаю", "думаю", "занимаюсь", etc.) that do not fit the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Как вы сюда попали? Голд. Он заключил с вами сделку, верно? Да, заключил.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other translations are incorrect because they use different verbs that do not accurately capture the meaning of the original sentence.For example:"Да, сделал" (Yes, he did) - this translation uses the verb "сделал" which means "did" but it does not convey the specific meaning of "made a deal" which is in the original English sentence."Да, захотел" (Yes, he wanted) - this translation uses the verb "захотел" which means "wanted" but it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence."Да, подумал" (Yes, he thought) - this translation uses the verb "подумал" which means "thought" but it does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.Therefore, the correct translation of the given English sentence is the one that uses the verb "заключил" which accurately conveys the meaning of "made a deal".
The correct Russian translation is: [Хорошо, я отправлю ссылку на вашу почту, Jmarks @ JMI.vox. Вообще-то, нет, просто меня взломали, можете отправить ссылку на почту моего ассистента? Это JP123 @ mymail.vox. Хорошо, отправлю.]This is because the correct translation needs to accurately reflect the meaning of the original English sentence. The given Russian sentence accurately conveys the same meaning as the English sentence, including the request to send the link to the assistant's email instead of the original recipient's email due to being hacked. Additionally, the word "отправлю" at the end of the sentence means "will send", which is the appropriate translation for the English "will do" in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Нормально. Мне нужно было освежить голову. И мы даже не пили. Не пили."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The sentence begins with "Good" which can be translated as "Нормально" or "Хорошо" in Russian. The next phrase "I needed to clear my head" is translated as "Мне нужно было освежить голову".The next phrase "And we didn't even drink" is translated as "И мы даже не пили", where "не пили" means "didn't drink". The last sentence "We didn't" is a repetition of the previous statement and is also translated as "Не пили".The other options presented in the question either use the wrong verb or do not match the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "не делали" means "didn't do" which does not match the context of the sentence, and "не хотели" means "didn't want" which changes the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Что произошло? Держи руки на руле. Я могу тебе помочь? Уже помог.].This translation is correct because it accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The first question "What happened?" is a general inquiry about a situation that is unclear. The second sentence "Keep your hands on the wheel" is an instruction to the person driving to maintain control of the vehicle. The third question "Can I help you?" offers assistance to the other person. The fourth sentence "You just did" is a response indicating that the person has already helped.The selected translation uses the correct verb tenses and verb forms in Russian to accurately convey the meaning of the original sentences. The other options use incorrect verb tenses or verbs that do not fit the context, making them inaccurate translations.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Звоню в отдел спецназа ФБР в Нью-Йорке. Я сам разберусь с Кёрком, Гарольд. Если ты ждешь, что мы отступим... Жду.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The word "жду" at the end of the sentence means "I wait", which is the appropriate response in this context. None of the other options provided accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence.Here is a breakdown of the translation:"Звоню в отдел спецназа ФБР в Нью-Йорке" means "I am calling the FBI SWAT team in New York.""Я сам разберусь с Кёрком, Гарольд" means "I will handle Kirk on my own, Harold.""Если ты ждешь, что мы отступим..." means "If you expect us to stand down...""Жду" means "I wait" and is the appropriate response in this context.
The correct translation is: [Я люблю людей. Я не люблю Риггса. Если ты хочешь с ним ужинать, то иди ужинай. Если не хочешь, не иди.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other translations have different verbs or noun forms that do not fit the context, such as "не делай" (don't do), "не думай" (don't think), "не занимайся" (don't occupy yourself), "не знай" (don't know), "не поступай" (don't act), "не помогай" (don't help), "не понимай" (don't understand), or "не говори" (don't speak).
None of the provided options is correct.The correct translation of the English sentence would be: "Дэнни! Ты толстеешь. Ты это слышишь? Да, я слышал."The correct Russian verb to use in this context is "толстеть" (to gain weight/get fat), not "потолстеть" (to become fat). Additionally, the subject of the sentence is male, so the word "потолстела" (you got fat - feminine) would not be appropriate.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Ну, говорил он, как фермер, знал в этом толк. Мы подружились и... И он вам помог. Да, помог.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is describing how he became friends with someone who talked like a farmer and knew his stuff. The friend helped him out, and the speaker confirms that he did indeed help him out by saying "Yep, he did." The word "helped" is translated as "помог" in Russian, which is the correct translation in this context. The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Могу ли я заказать себе последний ужин, чтобы сэкономить время? Дэн говорит, что он со всем справится. Правда ведь? Я справлюсь.]This is because the phrase "I do" in the original sentence implies agreement or confirmation that the speaker is also capable of handling the task at hand. The Russian word "справлюсь" directly translates to "I will handle it," which matches the intended meaning of the original sentence. The other options provided in the question do not accurately convey this meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [И я, наконец-то, свободна от тебя и готова возвыситься. Посмотри на город. Они боготворят меня. А те, кто не боготворят, станут.]This is because the verb "worship" in the English sentence is translated to the verb "боготворят" in Russian, which means "to worship." The correct form of this verb to use in this context is the third-person plural form, "боготворят," to agree with the subject "they" referring to the people in the city.The word "will" in the English sentence is translated to the Russian word "станут," which means "will become." This verb is used in the third-person plural form to agree with the subject "those who don't worship me" (те, кто не боготворят), which is also plural.Therefore, the correct translation is: [И я, наконец-то, свободна от тебя и готова возвыситься. Посмотри на город. Они боготворят меня. А те, кто не боготворят, станут.]
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Она там, где должна быть. Почему ты бросил меня? Бросил тебя? Я не бросал."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The Russian words used in this translation are appropriate for the context and convey the same message as the original English words.The other options given as translations are not correct because they either use incorrect vocabulary, incorrect verb forms, or convey a different meaning than the original sentence. For example:"Я не делал" means "I didn't do it," which does not convey the same meaning as the original sentence."Я не думал" means "I didn't think," which also does not convey the same meaning as the original sentence."Я не хотел" means "I didn't want to," which could be a possible translation, but "Я не бросал" is a more accurate translation in this context."Я не занимался" means "I didn't occupy myself," which is not an appropriate translation for the context."Я не знал" means "I didn't know," which does not convey the same meaning as the original sentence."Я не мог" means "I couldn't," which is not an appropriate translation for the context."Я не поступал" means "I didn't act," which is not an appropriate translation for the context."Я не помогал" means "I didn't help," which does not convey the same meaning as the original sentence."Я не понимал" means "I didn't understand," which does not convey the same meaning as the original sentence."Я не говорил" means "I didn't speak," which does not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[И эта особая посуда, которую ставят на стол только особым людям в особые дни! Боже, ты понимаешь, понимаешь, что я хотела, чтобы у меня всегда всё было особое. Подожди, ты больше не веришь в любовь? Конечно же верю.]
The correct Russian translation is: [Я продал ему кое-что. О чем ты? Ты правда хочешь знать? Конечно хочу.].This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The Russian sentence uses the correct verb forms and word order to express that the speaker sold something to someone, and that they are now having a conversation where the listener wants to know more. The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning or use incorrect verb forms, word order, or vocabulary.
The correct translation is: "Да. Адалинда сказала ему? Нет. Ты сказала."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker confirms that something happened ("Yes"), then asks if Adalind told someone about it, and the answer is "No", followed by the revelation that it was actually the person they're speaking to who revealed the information ("You did"). The other translations do not accurately convey this meaning and do not fit with the context of the conversation.
The correct Russian translation is: [Это бесполезная реликвия, Гидеон. Меч изначально не работал, как нужно. Знаешь, я думал, что ты больше других хочешь видеть смерть Черной феи. О да, хочу... но не ценой души моего сына.].This is because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options contain incorrect verb forms, such as "делаю" (do), "думаю" (think), "занимаюсь" (engage), "могу" (can), "нужно" (necessary), "поступаю" (act), "помогаю" (help), "понимаю" (understand), and "говорю" (speak), which do not convey the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation is: [Да. Знаешь, где он? Нет. Сказал бы, если б знал.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The Russian phrase "Сказал бы, если б знал" means "I would tell you if I knew" in English, which is the appropriate response to the question of whether the speaker knows where someone is located. The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning and may introduce confusion or ambiguity.
The correct Russian translation is: "Нет, сейчас разговор не о стране. А о тебе. Сара, никто не хочет умирать в своей прежней жизни. Майкл не хотел."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is clarifying that the previous discussion was not about the country, but about the person they are speaking to (Sara). They go on to explain that nobody wants to die to their old life and that Michael was no exception - he did not want to leave his old life behind. The word "хотел" (wanted) in the Russian translation accurately reflects Michael's desire, as expressed in the English sentence. The other options provided do not accurately capture the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Эти люди сожгли дотла дом детектива полиции. Страховка вам в помощь. Ещё ты взломал банковский счёт детектива Риццоли. Не делал я.]This is because the Russian sentence accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first sentence translates to "These people burned down the detective's home completely. Insurance can help you," which captures the same idea as "I hope they were insured." The second sentence translates to "You also hacked into Detective Rizzoli's bank account. I didn't do it," which accurately reflects the denial of the speaker in response to the accusation made in the previous sentence.The other options contain different verbs, tenses, or meanings that do not accurately convey the intended message of the original English sentence. Therefore, option [Эти люди сожгли дотла дом детектива полиции. Страховка вам в помощь. Ещё ты взломал банковский счёт детектива Риццоли. Не делал я.] is the correct translation.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Да. Ты мне так нравишься... Я когда-нибудь говорила это? Да-да, говорила.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "so like you" is translated as "так нравишься" in Russian, which means "I like you so much." The question "Did I ever say?" is translated as "Я когда-нибудь говорила это?" in Russian. And the response "Yes, yes, you did" is translated as "Да-да, говорила" in Russian, which means "Yes, yes, you said it."The other options provided in the question are incorrect because they use different verbs or forms of verbs that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence. For example, "делала" means "did," "хотела" means "wanted," "думала" means "thought," and so on. Therefore, option [Да. Ты мне так нравишься... Я когда-нибудь говорила это? Да-да, говорила.] is the correct translation.
The correct Russian translation is: [Здесь не хватает. Я же говорю, один из ребят... Почему ты не восполнил недостачу из своей доли? Я сделал, но она покрыла не всю недостачу.]This translation captures the meaning of the original sentence in English, which is asking why the listener did not make up for a shortage from their end, and the speaker's response that they tried to make up for it but could not completely cover the shortage. The other translations have different verb forms or phrases that do not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Мон-Эл пригласил меня на счастливый час. Конечно, пригласил. Он знает, как выпивать напитки. Конечно, делает.].This is because the verb "knows" in the English sentence is translated as "знает" in Russian, which is correctly used in all the options provided. However, the verb that follows "knows how to" should be translated as "делает" which means "does" in English. Therefore, the correct option is the one that uses "делает" after "знает, как выпивать напитки" which is option 2.To summarize, the correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is option 2: [Мон-Эл пригласил меня на счастливый час. Конечно, пригласил. Он знает, как выпивать напитки. Конечно, делает.].
The correct Russian translation is: [Возможно, я мог бы дать тебе нечто лучшее в обмен на твои сведения... Вы бы не стали играть со мной ни в какую игру. Я не знал, что ты готов играть по крупному, парень. Теперь знаю.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "Now I do" in the English sentence is translated as "Теперь знаю" in the Russian translation, which means "Now I know" in English. The other translations provided have different verb tenses or use incorrect Russian vocabulary, which makes them incorrect translations of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Что? Она получила сообщение о посылке. Я даже не знал, что у неё был почтовый ящик. Я тоже не знал.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence, which is expressing surprise and disbelief that the speaker did not know about the recipient's post office box and the fact that she received a text message about a package.The other translations provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence. For example, "Я не делала" (I didn't do it) or "Я не хотела" (I didn't want to) do not make sense in the context of the sentence and do not convey the intended meaning of surprise and disbelief.
The correct translation is: "Предоплата - умный бизнес. Где я могу ее найти? Я не видел ее. Но если увижу, то направлю ее к тебе." This is because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is saying that requiring payment upfront is a smart business practice, and in response to the question of where to find someone, they say that they haven't seen her but will send her in the direction of the person asking if they happen to come across her. The other translations do not accurately convey this meaning, as they either change the meaning of the original sentence or add unnecessary information.
The correct Russian translation is: [Да. И все счастливы. Подожди, тогда получается, что твоя тут... вовсе не хочет быть. Хочет, хочет.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, where one person confirms that everyone is happy, but then realizes that the girl in question may not want to be there. The other person responds by saying "Sure she does," indicating that the girl does, in fact, want to be there. The translation "Хочет, хочет" means "She wants to, she wants to," which accurately conveys the affirmative response of the other person. The other translations, such as "Делает, делает" (She does, she does) or "Думает, думает" (She thinks, she thinks) do not accurately convey the same meaning as the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Я просто хочу жить полной жизнью. Не боясь. Кирстен, я знаю, что ты знаешь, как я к тебе отношусь. Знаешь.]This is because the Russian word "знаешь" directly translates to "you know" which is the correct translation of "you know how I feel about you" in the original sentence. The other options provided do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is "Я хотел умереть. А сейчас? Нет. Не хочу из-за нее." This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, which is expressing a change in the speaker's desire to die due to the presence of another person, likely a romantic interest or loved one. The other options given do not accurately convey this meaning and may even change the meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Ну, иногда ты не можешь их спасти, и они умирают. Да, такое случается. Ты хранишь их всех в своем сердце? Да, храню."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The other options presented have different verbs that do not match the meaning of the sentence. For example, "делаю" (do) and "занимаюсь" (occupy oneself with) are not appropriate translations for "keep in your heart." Similarly, "хочу" (want) and "думаю" (think) do not accurately reflect the intended meaning. "Храню" (keep) is the correct verb in this context, meaning that the person holds the memories of the deceased individuals in their heart.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Он умер час назад. Отец двоих детей, любящий муж. Сейчас же удалите фото из исходящих. Уже удалила, но я хотела, чтобы вы увидели его лицо и его семью." This is because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence in Russian.The other options provided do not accurately translate the sentence and/or contain grammatical errors. For example, "Он умер час назад" is the correct translation for "He died an hour ago", and "удалите фото из исходящих" is the correct translation for "Delete it right now from your outbox", while the other options use different verbs or wordings that do not accurately convey the intended meaning. Additionally, the use of "уже" (already) in the second clause is appropriate, as the speaker is indicating that they have already deleted the photo, while the other options use different verbs or do not include "уже".
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[МВД собирается арестовать Корину в течение часа. И, эмм, вы хотите, чтобы я потянул ниточки? Нет, я хочу, чтобы вы сказали мне правду. Я уже сказал.]None of the options provided match the correct translation. The given sentence uses the acronym "DHS" (Department of Homeland Security), which does not have an exact equivalent in Russia, so it has been translated as "МВД" (Ministry of Internal Affairs) which is the closest equivalent in Russia. Additionally, the phrase "pull some strings" has been translated as "потянуть ниточки" instead of "воспользоваться связями" which is more commonly used in Russian.Therefore, the correct translation should be:[МВД собирается арестовать Корину в течение часа. И, эмм, вы хотите, чтобы я потянул ниточки? Нет, я хочу, чтобы вы сказали мне правду. Я уже сказал.]
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Бэн посмотрел на мужчину, который забрал моего сына, и отпустил его. Почему он сделал это? Я не знаю.

The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Некоторые места не меняются даже спустя годы. Пришло время считать цыплят. Я знаю, кто ты, Темный. Думаю, знаешь.]This translation is the correct one because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence.Here is a breakdown of each translated option and why they are incorrect:[Некоторые места не меняются даже спустя годы. Пришло время считать цыплят. Я знаю, кто ты, Темный. Думаю, делаешь.] - This translation uses the word "делаешь" which means "doing" rather than "knowing" which is what the English sentence implies.[Некоторые места не меняются даже спустя годы. Пришло время считать цыплят. Я знаю, кто ты, Темный. Думаю, хочешь.] - This translation uses the word "хочешь" which means "want" rather than "know" which is what the English sentence implies.[Некоторые места не меняются даже спустя годы. Пришло время считать цыплят. Я знаю, кто ты, Темный. Думаю, думаешь.] - This translation uses the word "думаешь" which means "think" rather than "know" which is what the English sentence implies.[Некоторые места не меняются даже спустя годы. Пришло время считать цыплят. Я знаю, кто ты, Темный. Думаю, занимаешься.] - This translation uses the word "занимаешься" which means "occupied" rather than "knowing" which is what the English sentence implies.[Некоторые места не меняются даже спустя годы. Пришло время считать цыплят. Я знаю, кто ты, Темный. Думаю, можешь.] - This translation uses the word "можешь" which means "can" rather than "knowing" which is what the English sentence implies.[Некоторые места не меняются даже спустя годы. Пришло время считать цыплят. Я знаю, кто ты, Темный. Думаю, поступаешь.] - This translation uses the word "поступаешь" which means "behaving" rather than "knowing" which is what the English sentence implies.[Некоторые места не меняются даже спустя годы.

The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Кора, что вы сжигаете? Пожалуйста, прочти молитву. Вы даже не верите в Бога. Ронни верил.].This is because the sentence "Ronnie did." in the English sentence is referring to Ronnie believing in God, and the most appropriate translation for "believed" in this context is "верил" (veril) in Russian. The other options provided in the answer choices do not convey the same meaning as "верил" and would not accurately translate the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is:[Джессика, Гибс легко может слетать в Аргентину и спросить Шейлу... Луис, ты себя слышишь? Она не пойдёт на это. А если и пойдёт, то ты не давил на свидетеля, потому что на неё не было повестки.]This is because the correct translation should accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. Among the options provided, this translation is the closest to the original sentence and captures the intended meaning. The key phrase "it's not witness tampering if a subpoena was never issued" is translated correctly in this option as "ты не давил на свидетеля, потому что на неё не было повестки," which means "you did not pressure the witness because there was no subpoena on her." The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Сама? Как же это произошло? Итак, знала ли Мюриэль Брюс, что было в её чемодане? Учитывая обстоятельства, полагаю, что не знала.].This is because the other options presented do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence. The word "полагаю" at the end of the sentence indicates that the speaker is making an assumption or opinion, rather than a statement of fact. The other options suggest different actions or thoughts on the part of Muriel Bruce, such as "didn't do it," "didn't want to," "didn't think," "couldn't," "didn't help," "didn't speak," which do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Ты даже не представляешь, какое доброе сердце было у твоей матери. Я оплакивал ее каждый день. Ты не знаешь, что это значит. Конечно знаю."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is telling someone that their mother had a very kind heart, and that the speaker has cried every day because of her loss. The other person doesn't understand what it means to cry every day for someone, and the speaker responds by saying that they do understand. The word "знаю" (know) is the most appropriate choice in this context because the speaker is trying to convey that they have experienced the same thing and have knowledge of what it means to cry every day.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [И я больше его не видел до утра, когда пришел на работу. Он говорил, куда направляется? Нет. Нет, он не сказал.].This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The verb "сказал" in Russian means "said", which is the appropriate translation for the past tense of "say" used in the English sentence. The other options presented in the question use different verbs that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence.For example, "сделал" means "did", "захотел" means "wanted", "подумал" means "thought", "занялся" means "occupied oneself with", "узнал" means "found out", "смог" means "was able to", "поступил" means "acted", and "помог" means "helped". None of these words accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence, and therefore they are incorrect translations.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Она бросила малышку Марию. А теперь она, сука, в психушке. Я не знаю, что мне делать. Конечно же знаешь, сынок.].This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The verb "left" in the English sentence is translated to "бросила" in Russian, which means "abandoned". The word "fuckin" in the English sentence is translated to "сука" in Russian, which is a derogatory term for a female dog and is used to express anger or frustration towards someone. The phrase "I don't know what to do" is translated to "Я не знаю, что мне делать" in Russian. The phrase "Of course you do, son" is translated to "Конечно же знаешь, сынок" in Russian, which means "Of course you know, son".The other translations have different verbs or phrases that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence. For example, "делаешь" means "doing" instead of "knowing", "хочешь" means "wanting" instead of "knowing", "думаешь" means "thinking" instead of "knowing", "занимаешься" means "engaging in" instead of "knowing", "можешь" means "able to" instead of "knowing", "поступаешь" means "behaving" instead of "knowing", "помогаешь" means "helping" instead of "knowing", "понимаешь" means "understanding" instead of "knowing", and "говоришь" means "speaking" instead of "knowing".
The correct Russian translation is: [Эйприл беременна. И она не хотела говорить Джексону. И... Я ему сказала.]This is because the original English sentence uses the verb "to tell" which means to communicate information to someone, and the correct translation of this verb in Russian is "сказать" (skazat'). The other options provided use verbs like "to make" or "to help" which do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. Additionally, the option "Я его узнала" translates to "I recognized him" which is completely different from the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Я сделал это не ради неё. Полагаю, вы хотите чего-то взамен. Да. Да, мисс Скерретт, хочу."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is saying that they did not do something for the person mentioned, and they believe that the other person wants something in return. The speaker confirms that they do want something in return by saying "Да, Да" (Yes, Yes), and addresses Miss Skerrett directly by saying "мисс Скерретт" (Miss Skerrett) and then says "хочу" (I do).The other translations do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence, as they use incorrect verbs or expressions that do not fit the context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Наряду с ней было сделано ещё с десяток других снимков, и что-то в них смутило меня, нечто такое, что я не мог мысленно совместить, а потом до меня дошло - все они одинаково кадрированы. Ракурс съёмки не менялся. А вы полагали, что мы ничего не заметим. Но, к сожалению для вас, мы заметили.]
I'm sorry, I cannot determine which one is the correct Russian translation of the given English sentence without additional context.However, I can tell you that some of the options provided contain offensive language and vulgarities, which may not be appropriate in all situations. It's important to use appropriate language in different contexts, such as formal or informal settings, and with different audiences.
The correct Russian translation for the English sentence is: "Они так увлечены. Уверены, что чего-то добьются. Мне пришлось вернуть Шеннон её прототип. Сказала, что не будет со мной разговаривать, пока я не верну."This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first two sentences indicate that "They get so excited" and "They think they can do anything." The third sentence states that "I had to give Shannon back that gizmo." The fourth sentence explains that "She said she'd never speak to me if I didn't."The Russian translation provided accurately reflects these statements and uses appropriate grammar and vocabulary to convey the same meaning in Russian. None of the other translations accurately convey the same meaning and some of them use incorrect grammar or vocabulary, making them incorrect translations.
The correct Russian translation is:[Я больше не хочу злиться, но не знаю, как остановиться. Тогда позволь извиниться за всю боль, которую тебе причинила. Ты не должна извиняться. Нет, должна.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is expressing remorse for their behavior and is apologizing for causing pain to the listener. The listener is told that they do not need to apologize, but the speaker insists that they should apologize, saying "No, должна" which translates to "No, you should." This accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence, where the speaker insists that the listener should not apologize, but the speaker themselves feels the need to apologize.The other translations provided do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original English sentence, as they use different verbs and do not convey the same sense of regret and apology.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я видел, как ты был расстроен. Да, да, так и было. Я знаю, что ты не догадывался, что случится с моим сыном той ночью. Нет, я не знал.]This is because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The translation correctly uses the past tense verbs "видел" (saw), "был" (was), and "знал" (knew) to describe past events. The use of the negative particle "не" in "не догадывался" (didn't know) and "не знал" (didn't know) indicates the speaker's lack of knowledge or awareness at the time. The other options, which use different verbs or particles, do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Спрятанные парашюты мы не искали. Это Рич расшифровывал сообщения Ахтара на Сквончере, поэтому солгал про вечеринку в стиле Гэтсби, чтобы его надеть. – Да, но откуда он знал, что мы привезём ему всё содержимое его хранилища? Он не знал.]
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[После того, как вы спросите меня о ряде событий, которые привели нас сюда сегодня. Хорошо, мы коснёмся вашей истории через минуту, но сперва я хочу задать вам вопрос о текущих событиях. Три дня назад Майк Росс обратился к вам с попыткой убедить не свидетельствовать против него? Да, он пытался.]So, the correct option is the first one: [После ваших вопросов о событиях, приведших нас в суд. Мы обратимся к истории через минутку, но сначала я хочу задать вопрос о нынешних событиях. Пытался ли Майк Росс 3 дня назад убедить вас не свидетельствовать против него? Да, он пытался.]
The correct Russian translation is: "Вы заботитесь о своей бороде так, как другие могли бы заботиться о кусте роз. И сейчас вы снова говорите, как солдат. Аббат, простите, но вы не понимаете. Думаю, я понимаю."This is because "думаю, я понимаю" is the most accurate translation of the English phrase "I think I do." The other options offered in the question either use incorrect verb forms or convey a slightly different meaning than the original English phrase.
The correct Russian translation is: [Я не спорю, капитан, но я могу подождать. И мне нравится моя жизнь такой, какая она есть, понимаете? Да, понимаю. Действительно понимаю].This is because the correct translation should accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence, and this option does that the best. The sentence expresses the speaker's agreement with the captain but also emphasizes that they are content with their current life and willing to wait. The phrase "Действительно понимаю" accurately translates to "I really do understand," which conveys the sense of agreement and emphasizes the speaker's sincerity. The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning or include incorrect words or grammar.
The correct translation of the given English sentence is: "Или мы могли бы притвориться, что никогда не находили этого. Хорошо. Но мой папа хочет знать, что происходило, когда он пропал. Конечно, хочет."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The word "хочет" in the translation means "wants," which is the correct verb to use in this context to express the father's desire to know what happened during his missing time. The other options presented in the question use different verbs that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Около 10 лет. Как вы с ним познакомились? Его брат попросил нанять его в почтовый отдел нашей фирмы. - И вы сделали.].This translation is correct because the phrase "And you did" at the end of the English sentence implies that the speaker did indeed hire the person in question. The Russian phrase "И вы сделали" conveys the same meaning, indicating that the speaker did what was asked of them. The other translations do not accurately convey this meaning, as they use words and phrases that suggest uncertainty or lack of action, such as "thought," "wanted," "learned," "able," "realized," "helped," "understood," or "said."
The correct Russian translation is: [Я был глупцом. Я думал, что я мог восстановить Гидру и управлять ей так, как Стефани командует своей лошадью. Я учил её верить в это, как в бога. И она верила.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The verb "commanded" in the English sentence is translated to "командует" in the Russian sentence, which is a more appropriate translation than "управлять" (to manage) used in the other options. Additionally, the verb "did" in the English sentence is translated to "верила" (believed) in the Russian sentence, which fits the context of the sentence better than the other options.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Что за шум весь вечер? Мы ходили на прогулку, леди Рэй. Я никакого приказа не давал. Я дал.].None of the provided options accurately translate the original English sentence. The correct translation conveys that the speaker went on a walk and did not give any orders, but did do something (presumably related to the noise mentioned earlier). Option 1 translates "prithee" as "шум" which means "noise," and the verb "went on a run" as "вернулись с поездки" which means "returned from a trip." Option 2 translates the same verb as "сделал" which means "did," but this does not accurately convey the sense of going on a run. Options 3-10 all use different verbs that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.It's important to note that translating between languages can be a complex process and often requires a nuanced understanding of both languages and their idiomatic expressions.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:"Я - это всё, что есть у этой маленькой девочки. И я никогда не был всем для кого-то. Теперь стал. Да, стал."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is expressing that they are now everything to the little girl, something that they have never been before. The phrase "But you showed up" implies that the speaker's relationship with the little girl changed because of the presence or actions of another person.None of the other translations provided accurately convey this meaning, and some of them are completely unrelated to the original sentence. For example, "Я - это всё, что есть у этой маленькой девочки" is consistent in all of the translations and means "I am everything to this little girl," but the other parts of the sentences do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Это под номером 9. Девять? Я знаю, что это. Знаешь, правда?]This is because the phrase "Oh, you do, do you?" is an expression of surprise or sarcasm, which in this case is better conveyed by the question "Знаешь, правда?" which translates to "You know, right?" in English. None of the other options capture this tone as accurately.
The correct Russian translation is: "Я велел Эннализ не привлекать её. Она даст нам время. Вы клянётесь говорить правду, только правду и ничего, кроме правды? Клянусь."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker told Annalise that she cannot testify, as it will buy them time. Then, the speaker asks the question "Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?" and the person being asked responds "I do," which is accurately translated as "Клянусь" in Russian.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Мне подтвердили заказ. Деталь для стиральной машины придет сегодня вечером. Отлично, рабочий придет завтра. Нет, ты не могла.]This is because the Russian sentence accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The other translations do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.For example, "Нет, ты не делала" means "No, you didn't do it" which doesn't fit in the context of the given English sentence. Similarly, "Нет, ты не хотела" means "No, you didn't want to" which doesn't make sense in the given context either.Therefore, the first translation is the correct one as it accurately conveys the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Я не убивала Робин. Я даже не знала, что она выяснила правду. Линда, пора все рассказать. Я рассказала.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, which is about the speaker denying that they killed Robyn and admitting that they did not know she had found out the truth. The speaker then tells Linda that it is time to come clean and admits that they themselves have already done so.The other translations do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence. For example, "Я сделала" (I did it) and "Я захотела" (I wanted to) suggest that the speaker has committed a wrongdoing, which is not the case in the original sentence. "Я узнала" (I found out) and "Я помогла" (I helped) are also incorrect because they do not reflect what the speaker is trying to communicate in the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Прости, что? Что? Ты только что назвала меня Робертом. Нет, не называла."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence, where the speaker is expressing confusion and disbelief that they were called by the wrong name. The phrase "no, I didn't" is translated as "нет, не называла," which directly negates the claim that the speaker called the other person Robert. The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct translation is: [Это Тана. Пусть Холстед и Линдсей съездят к родителям. Если я поговорю с этой девушкой, она расскажет мне какую-то другую историю? Если расскажет, то соврёт.]This is the most accurate translation because it correctly conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The sentence is talking about a girl who may give a different story and if she does, she's lying. The use of the verb "расскажет" (will tell) in the conditional tense and the adjective "другую" (different) correctly convey the possibility of the girl telling a different story. The verb "соврёт" (will lie) accurately conveys the consequence if the girl does tell a different story.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я на самом деле не уверен в этом, так что просто доверься мне, хорошо? Задержитесь здесь еще на пару дней. Думаю, ты просто хочешь, чтобы мы были здесь с тобой. Да, я хочу.]This is because it accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The other options either use the wrong verb (e.g. "делаю," "занимаюсь"), use the wrong form of the verb (e.g. "могу"), or use a verb that does not make sense in this context (e.g. "поступаю," "помогаю"). The correct translation uses the verb "хочу" which means "want" in English and correctly reflects the speaker's desire to have the others stay with them.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Общалась по телефону с потенциальным инвестором. В эти дни только Кикстартер хоть как-то помогает бизнесу. Вы принесли фрагмент с серийником и номером партии? Да, я принёс.]This translation accurately conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence. The other translations contain incorrect verb forms, such as "сделал" (did), "захотел" (wanted), "подумал" (thought), "занялся" (got busy with), "узнал" (found out), "смог" (was able to), "поступил" (acted), "помог" (helped), "понял" (understood), and "сказал" (said). These verb forms do not accurately reflect the actions or responses given in the original English sentence, and would change the intended meaning of the sentence if used instead of the correct form "принёс" (brought).
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Послушай, дай объяснить. Она хочет гарантий, что её не депортируют. Скажите ей да. Я сказал, но она настаивает на том, чтобы давать показания анонимно.]This translation corresponds to the first option provided, with slight modifications to improve accuracy. The original sentence in English has been accurately translated into Russian, conveying the same meaning as the original sentence. The translation correctly captures the main ideas and intentions of the original sentence, including the speaker's request for the listener to let them explain, the woman's desire for assurance that she won't be deported, and her request to testify anonymously. The rest of the options provided have incorrect translations that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Она работала в пограничной охране, имела полный доступ к базе. Так это ею овладел Апоп? Это значит, что в храме Апоп взял кулон, но Шарлин сбежала. Конечно сделала.]This translation is the most accurate because it correctly conveys the meaning of the English sentence in Russian without any grammatical errors or mistranslations. The verb "сделала" in this translation means "did" or "made," which accurately reflects the intended meaning of the English phrase "Of course she did" in the context of the sentence. The other options provided contain various verb forms that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Отныне мое единственное желание — посвятить свою жизнь служению Семерым. Позвольте мне стать примером их милости, чтобы направлять окружающих на истинный путь. Отдаете ли вы себе отчет в последствиях просьбы? Отдаю.]This is because the word "отдаю" in this translation means "I do" in English, which is the correct response to the question "You understand fully what this means?" that was asked in the original sentence. The other options in the given translations do not convey the same meaning or are grammatically incorrect.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence "{I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just reassure me. I did, like 20 times.}" is: [Прости. Прости. Просто успокой меня. Я уже раз 20 успокоила.]This is because the verb "to reassure" in English is translated to "успокоить" in Russian, and the correct form for "I reassured" in the past tense is "успокоила" for a female speaker or "успокоил" for a male speaker.Out of the options given, the only one that correctly uses this verb in the past tense and matches the gender of the speaker is "Прости. Прости. Просто успокой меня. Я уже раз 20 успокоила." The other options use different verbs or verb forms that do not correctly convey the meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Если ты хоть что-то ко мне чувствуешь, ты не станешь их трогать. Я всё упрощу. У тебя есть два часа, чтобы сдаться мне. Если сдашься, они будут жить." This translation accurately conveys the meaning and tone of the original sentence. The verb "сдаться" (to surrender) is the appropriate choice for the phrase "turn yourself over to me" in this context. The word "сделаешь" (if you do) in one of the options does not accurately capture the intended meaning of the English sentence. Similarly, "захочешь" (if you want to) and "подумаешь" (if you think about it) are not appropriate translations of the phrase "if you ever cared for me." Therefore, the correct answer is the first option.
The correct Russian translation is: [В заброшенном доме. По описанию, один из домов на улице Спархок. Вы знаете это место? Да, знаю.].This is because "знаю" is the correct translation of "I do" in this context, which indicates that the speaker is familiar with the location being discussed. The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is "Если не отзовёшь иск, Кейхил пригрозит отменой сделки. Что? Уже пригрозил."This is because "He already did" in the original sentence implies that Cahill has already threatened to pull the deal, which is correctly translated as "Уже пригрозил" in the given options. The other options do not convey the meaning of the original sentence accurately.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence "{Not if he had his timings right... It takes two people to get someone into a dress? Quite intricate. .. which he did.}" is: "[Нет, если всё правильно рассчитать... "Неужели нужны два помощника, чтобы надеть платье?" "Оно довольно сложное". ... а он рассчитал.]"This is because the Russian translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "if he had his timings right" is translated as "если всё правильно рассчитать" which means "if everything is calculated correctly". The phrase "It takes two people to get someone into a dress? Quite intricate. .." is translated as "Неужели нужны два помощника, чтобы надеть платье?" "Оно довольно сложное" which means "Do you really need two assistants to put on a dress? It's quite complicated". Finally, the phrase "which he did" is translated as "а он рассчитал" which means "and he calculated it".
The correct Russian translation is: "Патологоанатом тоже замешан? Когда я нашла халат, на нем была кровь. - Я не подбрасывала... - Значит, кто-то сделал."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "Is the medical examiner in on this?" is translated as "Патологоанатом тоже замешан?" which means "Is the medical examiner involved as well?"The second sentence, "Your father's blood was on the coat when I found it," is translated as "Когда я нашла халат, на нем была кровь," which means "When I found the coat, there was blood on it."The third sentence, "I didn't plant... - Yeah, well, somebody did," is translated as "Я не подбрасывала... - Значит, кто-то сделал," which means "I didn't plant it... So, somebody did it."The other options provided in the question do not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence, either by mistranslating key words or by introducing incorrect words or phrases.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Кстати, меня зовут Элизабет. Он не мог вас найти, поэтому... В любом случае, это вам все объяснит. Да, объяснит.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence.For example:"Да, сделает" means "Yes, will do it," which is not the intended meaning of the sentence."Да, захочет" means "Yes, will want to," which is also not the intended meaning of the sentence."Да, подумает" means "Yes, will think about it," which is not the intended meaning of the sentence."Да, займется" means "Yes, will deal with it," which is not the intended meaning of the sentence."Да, сможет" means "Yes, will be able to," which is not the intended meaning of the sentence."Да, поступит" means "Yes, will act," which is not the intended meaning of the sentence."Да, поможет" means "Yes, will help," which is not the intended meaning of the sentence."Да, поймет" means "Yes, will understand," which is not the intended meaning of the sentence."Да, скажет" means "Yes, will say," which is not the intended meaning of the sentence.Therefore, option [Кстати, меня зовут Элизабет. Он не мог вас найти, поэтому... В любом случае, это вам все объяснит. Да, объяснит.] is the correct Russian translation for the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Видеться с ним вне стен больницы - плохая идея, особенно учитывая кто за ним стоит. Но... Но если ты настаиваешь. Настаиваю.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "But if you insist on..." is followed by the phrase "I do," indicating that the speaker agrees to do something despite their initial reservations. The word "настаиваю" in the correct translation means "I insist" and is the appropriate response in this context. The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Я ждал звонка каждый день в течение 15 лет. Потому что Джимми Притчард, которого я знал, не сдаётся. Поэтому я попросил Мэри разрешения использовать ресурсы её компании, чтобы выяснить, что на самом деле произошло. И вы это сделали."None of the provided options is entirely correct, as they all contain different inaccuracies or mistranslations. Some of them have verb tenses that don't match the original sentence, or use incorrect words. Others don't convey the correct meaning of the English sentence, or use expressions that don't exist in Russian.Therefore, it is necessary to carefully analyze the original English sentence and translate each phrase or sentence correctly, taking into account the proper verb tenses, word choice, and idiomatic expressions.
The correct Russian translation is:[Через три месяца она бы вышла на УДО. Зачем бросать все это? Я не знаю. Но, спорим, Джоуи знает.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other translations contain different verbs that do not fit the context of the sentence or use incorrect grammar.
The correct Russian translation is: [Хорошо, мы все достаточно повеселились, почему бы нам не открыть учебники? Глава 7, Сражение при Аппоматтоксе. Мы проходили это вчера. Нет, не делали.].This translation captures the meaning of the original English sentence accurately. The sentence is a suggestion to open up textbooks and start studying chapter seven on the Battle of Appomattox after having fun. The response "We did that yesterday" is negated by "No, you didn't," indicating that the speaker believes the students did not study it yesterday. The word "делали" (did) in the correct translation captures the meaning of the response accurately. None of the other options provide an accurate translation for this sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Насколько глубока твоя любовь. Ты же меня понимаешь, да? Да, Леопольд. Теперь понимаю.].This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. "Насколько глубока твоя любовь" translates to "How deeply you love," "Ты же меня понимаешь, да?" translates to "You do understand me, don't you?" and "Да, Леопольд. Теперь понимаю." translates to "Yes, Leopold. Now I do."The other options provided in the question do not accurately translate the original sentence or convey its intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Этот человек спас мою жизнь. Заходи, Майкл. Они покормили тебя? Да, покормили, спасибо.].This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence in Russian. The verb "feed" in English is translated as "покормить" in Russian, and the response "They did, yes, thank you" is accurately translated as "Да, покормили, спасибо" which means "Yes, they fed me, thank you." The other options offered in the question use verbs that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence, such as "сделали" (made), "захотели" (wanted), "подумали" (thought), "занялись" (occupied), "смогли" (could), "поступили" (acted), "помогли" (helped), "поняли" (understood), and "сказали" (said), which do not fit the context and meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Полли, мне жаль. - Просто эта женщина... - Не отсылала меня. А ты отослала."This is because "отсылать" means "to send away" in Russian, which is the correct translation of "send me away" in the given sentence. The other options presented do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "У этой болонки такая же визитка. Временные решения. Не хочешь рассказать мне, как это всевидящее око не замечает нас? Оно замечает."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The key phrases and ideas in the English sentence have been accurately translated into Russian, and the overall meaning of the sentence has been preserved. Specifically, the phrase "all-seeing eye" has been correctly translated to "всевидящее око," and the phrase "doesn't see us coming" has been translated to "не замечает нас." Additionally, the verb "does" has been translated to "замечает," which accurately conveys the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Даже не заводи меня насчет его солиситора. Ты прижала Хантли вождением? Я знаю, как работать под прикрытием. Я и не говорил, что ты не знаешь.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. Here's the breakdown:"Даже не заводи меня насчет его солиситора" translates to "Don't even get me started on the solicitor." This accurately captures the speaker's frustration and desire not to discuss the solicitor in question."Ты прижала Хантли вождением?" translates to "You pressed Huntley on the driving?" This accurately conveys the question the speaker is asking."Я знаю, как работать под прикрытием" translates to "I know how to work undercover." This accurately conveys the speaker's confidence in their ability to work undercover."Я и не говорил, что ты не знаешь" translates to "I never said you didn't." This accurately conveys the speaker's clarification that they never claimed the listener didn't know how to work undercover.The other options provided contain various errors in grammar, vocabulary, or meaning that make them inaccurate translations of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Не хочешь выпить? Я помню, ты обещал мне выпивку. И поездку на велосипеде. Обещал, да?"This is because the word "обещал" (obeshchal) in Russian means "promised," which is the correct translation for the English word "promised" in the sentence. The other options provided do not accurately convey the meaning of the English sentence.For example, "делал" (delal) means "did," but it does not capture the sense of making a promise. "Хотел" (khotel) means "wanted," which is not the same as promising. "Думал" (dumal) means "thought," which also does not convey the meaning of making a promise. "Занимался" (zanimalsya) means "occupied oneself," which does not fit in the context of the sentence. "Знал" (znal) means "knew," which also does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Мог" (mog) means "could," which does not fit the meaning of the sentence. "Поступал" (postupal) means "behaved," which is not the same as making a promise. "Помогал" (pomogal) means "helped," which does not convey the meaning of making a promise. "Понимал" (ponimal) means "understood," which is not the same as making a promise. "Говорил" (govoril) means "said," which is not the same as making a promise.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Кстати говоря, вы читали об исследовании, которое доказало, что зелёный чай очень полезен? Куда полезнее того, что мы пьем. Мне не нравятся китайские чаи. А мне нравятся.]This is because the other options contain verbs that do not fit in the context of the sentence or do not make sense.For example, the second option includes the verb "делаю," which means "do" or "make," but it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. The third option includes the verb "хочу," which means "want," but this does not accurately reflect the speaker's opinion about Chinese tea. The fourth option includes the verb "думаю," which means "think," but this verb does not accurately reflect the speaker's opinion about green tea or Chinese tea. The other options similarly include verbs that do not fit in the context of the sentence or do not accurately reflect the speaker's opinions.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Я нашла ее на днях. Я совсем забыла о ней. Помнишь, когда мы это вырезали? Да, помню.]This is because the other options presented do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence. For example:[Я нашла ее на днях. Я совсем забыла о ней. Помнишь, когда мы это вырезали? Да, делаю.] - This translation would mean "Yes, I'm doing it," which does not make sense in the context of the conversation.[Я нашла ее на днях. Я совсем забыла о ней. Помнишь, когда мы это вырезали? Да, хочу.] - This translation would mean "Yes, I want to," which is also not appropriate in the given context.[Я нашла ее на днях. Я совсем забыла о ней. Помнишь, когда мы это вырезали? Да, занимаюсь.] - This translation would mean "Yes, I'm busy with it," which does not fit the conversation.[Я нашла ее на днях. Я совсем забыла о ней. Помнишь, когда мы это вырезали? Да, помогаю.] - This translation would mean "Yes, I'm helping," which does not make sense in the context of the conversation.[Я нашла ее на днях. Я совсем забыла о ней. Помнишь, когда мы это вырезали? Да, поступаю.] - This translation would mean "Yes, I'm acting," which is not appropriate in the given context.[Я нашла ее на днях. Я совсем забыла о ней. Помнишь, когда мы это вырезали? Да, понимаю.] - This translation would mean "Yes, I understand," which does not convey the intended meaning of the conversation.[Я нашла ее на днях. Я совсем забыла о ней. Помнишь, когда мы это вырезали? Да, могу.] - This translation would mean "Yes, I can," which is not appropriate in the given context.[Я нашла ее на днях. Я совсем забыла о ней. Помнишь, когда мы это вырезали? Да, говорю.] - This translation would mean "Yes, I'm speaking," which does not fit the conversation.Therefore, the correct translation is option one, which accurately conveys the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Да, это твой выбор. Но это же упрямство. С вами говорила Бейли? Говорила.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. The first part of the sentence, "I mean, also, it's your choice. It's also stubborn," is translated as "Да, это твой выбор. Но это же упрямство." The second part of the sentence, "Bailey spoke to you? She did," is translated as "С вами говорила Бейли? Говорила."The other translations are incorrect because they use the wrong verb tense or the wrong verb altogether, which changes the meaning of the sentence. For example, "Да, это твой выбор. Но это же упрямство. С вами говорила Бейли? Делала." uses the verb "делала," which means "to do," instead of "говорила," which means "to speak."
The correct Russian translation is:[Кажется, у вас сегодня тоже выпускной. Лучше бы мне подняться туда, иначе никто никуда не попадет. Я думала, вы не хотите, чтобы я прошла обучение. Я не хотел.]This translation captures the meaning of the English sentence most accurately. The verb "didn't" in the English sentence is in the past tense, which corresponds to the past tense form "не хотел" in the Russian sentence. The other options given contain verbs in the wrong tense or with a different meaning, which would change the meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Извинения приняты. Я не извинялся. Можно сказать извинился. Ты практически извинился."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is accepting the apology even though the other person didn't technically apologize. However, the other person did something similar to apologizing, and the speaker is acknowledging that by saying "ты практически извинился" which means "you practically apologized".The other translations provided are not correct because they do not accurately convey the same meaning as the original English sentence. For example, "ты практически захотел" means "you practically wanted" which doesn't make sense in the context of the conversation. Similarly, "ты практически смог" means "you practically could" which also doesn't make sense in this context.
The correct Russian translation is: [А теперь. Можно начать сначала, Рэй. Говорила, что всё получится, не так ли? Да, говорила.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is acknowledging that they have a fresh start and that everything has worked out as they predicted. The response "Yeah, you did" confirms that the person being spoken to had previously expressed confidence in the situation working out. None of the other options convey the same meaning as the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Что скажешь? Голубой или темно-бордовый? Ты нашёл работу за один день? Я бы не примерял галстуки, если бы не нашел." This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence.The other translations are incorrect because they use the wrong verbs or verb forms that do not match the intended meaning of the sentence. For example, "делал" (did) and "занимался" (was busy with) imply that the person was doing something else, not necessarily finding a job, while "хотел" (wanted) and "думал" (thought) do not convey the sense of having actually found a job. "Знал" (knew) and "понимал" (understood) are also incorrect because they do not express the idea of actively searching for a job and then succeeding in finding one in a short amount of time, which is what the speaker is implying in the original sentence. Finally, "говорил" (said) and "помогал" (helped) are incorrect because they do not relate to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in this context.
The correct Russian translation is: "Потому, что изначально, для открытия сейфа нужны были два ключа. У Суда все еще есть один из них, а второй считался потерянным. Пока я его не нашел. Вы имеете в виду, мы нашли."This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is saying that the safe originally required two keys to open it, one of which was still in the possession of the court while the second key was thought to be lost. However, the speaker found the second key, and the listener is clarifying that it was actually "we" (the speaker and the listener) who found it, not just the speaker alone. The word "нашли" (found) accurately reflects the past tense of the verb "found" in the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Предварительный допрос продолжался 7 часов. Она не спала. Она не сломается. Они не остановятся, пока она не сломается.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original sentence. The phrase "She won't break" means that the person being interrogated is strong and resilient and won't give in to pressure. This is translated as "Она не сломается" in the correct option, which means "She won't break."The other options provided have various mistranslations or inaccuracies. For example, "Она не сделает" (she won't do) in option 2 and "Она не захочет" (she won't want to) in option 3 do not convey the intended meaning of the original sentence. Option 4, "Она не подумает" (she won't think) and option 5, "Она не узнает" (she won't find out) do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Option 6, "Она не сможет" (she won't be able to) and option 7, "Она не поступит" (she won't act) do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence, as they do not capture the idea of strength and resilience. Option 8, "Она не поможет" (she won't help) and option 9, "Она не поймет" (she won't understand) do not convey the intended meaning of the sentence either. Finally, option 10, "Она не скажет" (she won't say) is not an accurate translation of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Пока любовь как музыка, играй, играй. Ты знал, что с сегодняшней недели официально начинается сезон кленового сиропа? Я... Нет, не знал."This is because the other translations provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence. The correct translation uses the same metaphor of music being the food of love and the imperative to "play on" as a way of urging someone to continue pursuing their love, or whatever they are passionate about. The second part of the sentence inquires if the person knew about the official start of maple syrup season, to which the answer is "no". The other translations either change the meaning of the sentence or use inappropriate verb forms or vocabulary, making them incorrect.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Он никогда не простит тебя, ты знаешь, он никогда не освободит тебя. Особенно после того как узнает, что ты сделала с его маленькой подругой. Я ничего не сделала его глупой маленькой подругой. Но боюсь, что ты сделала это давным-давно.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options contain different verbs or expressions that do not fit the context or change the meaning of the original sentence. For example:"Захотела" (Option 2) means "wanted" and does not fit the context of the sentence."Подумала" (Option 3) means "thought" and does not convey the idea of the person having done something to the friend."Занялась" (Option 4) means "engaged in" and does not fit the context of the sentence."Узнала" (Option 5) means "found out" and does not convey the idea of the person having done something to the friend."Смогла" (Option 6) means "could" and does not fit the context of the sentence."Поступила" (Option 7) means "acted" and does not convey the idea of the person having done something to the friend."Помогла" (Option 8) means "helped" and does not fit the context of the sentence."Поняла" (Option 9) means "understood" and does not convey the idea of the person having done something to the friend."Сказала" (Option 10) means "said" and does not convey the idea of the person having done something to the friend.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Да, я просто хотел вернуться в С.Т.А.Р. Лабс и потренироваться. Учитывая, как ты взорвался из-за Барри у всех на глазах, может, лучше подождать? Ну, правда вышла наружу, так что... Да, вышла.]This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is saying that they want to return to S.T.A.R. Labs to train, but given the recent conflict with Barry, it might be better to wait. The speaker then acknowledges that the truth has come out, so there is no point in hiding it anymore. The other options provided do not accurately convey this meaning and are therefore incorrect translations.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[- Не проси меня это делать. Мона, умоляю тебя. Ты единственная знаешь, как сделать что-то подобное. Да, знаю.]This translation is the correct one because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The English sentence expresses the speaker's reluctance to do something and begs Mona, who is the only one who knows how to do it, not to ask him to do it. Mona responds by saying "Yes, I do," indicating that she understands what the speaker is going through and has experience in making something similar.The other translations provided do not accurately convey the same meaning as the original English sentence. For example, some of the translations include different verbs that do not match the action being described in the English sentence, such as "делаю" (do) or "хочу" (want). Other translations include verbs that are not appropriate in this context, such as "думаю" (think) or "говорю" (speak). Therefore, the correct translation is the one that accurately conveys the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Она чувствовала себя как в ловушке. Не могла справиться сама с собой. Родители не платили ей ни пенни. Но вы платили.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. It translates the phrase "getting out off her own back" as "справиться сама с собой" which means "to cope with something alone."Option 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 have incorrect translations. For example, Option 2 replaces "paid" with "did" which changes the meaning of the sentence. Option 3 replaces "paid" with "wanted" which again changes the meaning of the sentence. Option 4 replaces "paid" with "thought" which completely changes the meaning of the sentence. Option 5 replaces "paid" with "were engaged" which is not an appropriate translation. Option 6 replaces "paid" with "knew" which again changes the meaning of the sentence. Option 7 replaces "paid" with "could" which doesn't fit the context of the sentence. Option 9 replaces "paid" with "helped" which changes the meaning of the sentence. Option 10 replaces "paid" with "understood" which is not an appropriate translation. Option 11 replaces "paid" with "said" which again changes the meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Я не хочу, чтобы ты уезжала. Бабушка плохо себя чувствует. И ты должна бросить всё и ухаживать за ней? Да, Уильям, должна."This translation captures the meaning of the original English sentence most accurately. The first sentence "I hate that you're leaving" is translated as "Я не хочу, чтобы ты уезжала" which means "I don't want you to leave." The second sentence "Well, Grandma's not doing well" is translated as "Бабушка плохо себя чувствует" which means "Grandma is not feeling well." The third sentence "So you have to drop everything to go take care of her?" is translated as "И ты должна бросить всё и ухаживать за ней?" which means "And you have to drop everything and take care of her?" The response "Yes, William, I do" is translated as "Да, Уильям, должна" which means "Yes, William, I have to."The other options have some errors in their translations, such as using the wrong verb or tense, or not capturing the meaning of the original sentence accurately.
The correct Russian translation is: [Это просто тренировочный меч. Он даже не заточен. Поверь... ты не захочешь узнать, каково это получить тренировочным мечом по лицу. Я уже знаю.]This is because the correct translation should accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. In this case, the Russian sentence translates to "This is just a practice sword. It isn't even sharpened. Believe me... you don't want to know what it's like to get hit in the face with a practice sword. I already know." This accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence and uses appropriate vocabulary and grammar.The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence. For example, "Я уже делаю" (I'm already doing it) and "Я уже хочу" (I already want to) do not accurately convey the meaning of the English sentence. Similarly, "Я уже занимаюсь" (I'm already doing it) and "Я уже могу" (I already can) do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Где ты это достал? Пришлось заняться официальным делом на порту с неприветливым сотрудником. Ты втянула Рэя Донована в это, и он убил Ивана. - Ты прав, я это сделала.]None of the options provided in the question match the correct translation. The correct translation includes some additional details that are not present in any of the given options.Here is a breakdown of the differences:Пришлось заняться официальным делом на порту с неприветливым сотрудником. (Had to take care of an official at the port who wasn't friendly.) - This adds more detail about the situation that the speaker had to deal with at the port.Ты втянула Рэя Донована в это, и он убил Ивана. (You brought Ray Donovan into this and he killed Ivan.) - This is the same as in the original sentence.Ты прав, я это сделала. (You're right, I did.) - This is the same as in the original sentence.Therefore, the correct translation is the first option that includes the additional details that were not present in any of the given options.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Наш друг больше не задаст неуместных вопросов. Его ересь несравнима с угрозой в виде Титанов. Мы едва избежали их. Но ведь избежали, потому что Он предупредил вас.]This is because the translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options contain different verb forms that change the meaning of the sentence. For example, "сделали" means "did" or "made", "захотели" means "wanted", "подумали" means "thought", "занялись" means "took up", "узнали" means "found out", "смогли" means "managed to", "поступили" means "acted", and "помогли" means "helped". These different verb forms do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:Я собирался сказать ему, знаете ли. Я собирался сказать ему, что именно он должен быть управляющим партнёром. Луис, у тебя, конечно, есть недостатки, но он не имел права так с тобой говорить. Да, имел.The key phrase that determines the correct translation is "Yes, he did." which implies that the person being referred to in the previous sentence did have the right to talk to Louis in that way. The only translation that accurately conveys this meaning is the one that uses "Да, имел" which translates to "Yes, he did."The other options use different verbs such as "делал" (did), "хотел" (wanted), "думал" (thought), "занимался" (occupied himself), "мог" (could), "поступал" (acted), "помогал" (helped), "понимал" (understood), and "говорил" (spoke). None of these verbs convey the same meaning as "имел" which specifically means "had" or "possessed" in this context. Therefore, the correct translation is the one that uses "Да, имел".
The correct Russian translation for the English sentence "{You think she knows we got him? Yes. I believe she does. They both do.}" is:[Думаете, она знает, что мы нашли его? Да. Я думаю, она знает. Они обе знают.]This translation is correct because it accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. In Russian, the verb "знать" means "to know," which is the correct verb to use in this context. The other verbs in the options provided do not accurately convey the meaning of the sentence.Additionally, "знают" is the correct conjugation of the verb "знать" for the third person plural, which is the correct form to use for the pronoun "they" in the sentence.Therefore, the correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Думаете, она знает, что мы нашли его? Да. Я думаю, она знает. Они обе знают.]
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Эллиот, отпусти. Мы все здесь совершили ошибки. Алан не спас тебя. А я спасла.]This is the correct translation because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is addressing someone named Elliot and telling them to "let it go", suggesting that they move on from a mistake that was made. The speaker goes on to acknowledge that everyone made mistakes, and that someone named Alan did not save Elliot, but the speaker did. The word "спасла" in the translation means "saved" which accurately reflects the speaker's statement that they were the one who saved Elliot.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Посмотрела новости, постирала немного. Потом я заметила, что в чулане бардак, и решила всё переставить. Мам, ты не должна этого делать! А я сделала.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which describes a sequence of events that took place. The speaker watched the news, did some laundry, and then noticed that the pantry was cluttered, so she decided to reorganize it. When her mother told her that she didn't have to do it, the speaker replied that she already had.The other options presented in the question do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "А я захотела" (And I wanted to) and "А я узнала" (And I found out) do not fit the context of the sentence and would not be appropriate translations. Similarly, "А я поступила" (And I acted) and "А я сказала" (And I said) do not accurately reflect the speaker's actions in the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Ты всегда будешь защищать меня, несмотря ни на что. Даже если я возненавижу тебя за это. Ты заслуживаешь свободы от Клауса. Мы все заслуживаем.]This translation accurately conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence. The use of "заслуживаем" (zasluzhivayem) in the final sentence indicates that "we all deserve" to be free of Klaus, which matches the intended meaning of the English sentence. None of the other options use the correct form of the verb "to deserve" to accurately convey this meaning. Additionally, "заслуживаешь" (zasluzhivaesh) in the third sentence accurately translates "you deserve" in reference to being free of Klaus.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Как они смогли принять решение за один день? Это не имеет смысла. Ты звонила Джине? - Нет, звонила Марва.]None of the options provided match the correct translation. The correct translation for "deliberated" in this context is "принять решение" (to make a decision) rather than "вынести решение" (to render a decision). Additionally, the verb forms used in the options do not match the tense and aspect of the original sentence.Here is the breakdown of the correct translation:    "How could they have deliberated for one day?" translates to "Как они смогли принять решение за один день?"   "That makes no sense." translates to "Это не имеет смысла."   "Oh, did you call Gina?" translates to "Ты звонила Джине?"   "No, Marva did." translates to "Нет, звонила Марва."Therefore, none of the options provided are correct, and the correct Russian translation is:[Как они смогли принять решение за один день? Это не имеет смысла. Ты звонила Джине? - Нет, звонила Марва.]
The correct Russian translation is: [Лорел... Мы не позвонили Ашеру в тот день. Ни у кого не было его номера. А если бы позвонили и поговорили бы с ним, то ничего бы не случилось.]This is because the phrase "if we did" in the original English sentence refers to the action of calling Asher, which is most accurately translated as "если бы позвонили" in Russian. The other options provided in the question use verbs like "сделали", "захотели", "подумали", "узнали", "смогли", "помогли", or "сказали", which do not convey the same meaning as "позвонили" and are therefore incorrect translations in this context.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Она сделала плохой выбор, и я виню ее. Не смотри на меня так. Я знаю, что это не имеет смысла, и я знаю, что ты не поймешь. На самом деле, я понимаю."None of the options provided in the question matches the correct translation. The correct translation uses the phrase "плохой выбор" which means "bad choice" instead of "неправильный выбор" which means "wrong choice". Also, the last sentence uses the phrase "на самом деле" which means "actually" instead of the other options provided.It is important to note that machine translation can sometimes produce inaccurate results, so it is always best to consult a professional translator or use reliable translation tools.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Ты думаешь, что знаешь, что жизнь может предложить тебе, и тут... Это ведь не снова футбольная штука? "Моя футбольная..." Ты только что сказал "моя футбольная штука"? Уверен, что сказал.]This is because this translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence while maintaining proper grammar and syntax in Russian. The other options include incorrect verb conjugations, word choices, or verb tenses that do not fit the context of the sentence. The chosen option correctly uses the past tense, which reflects the conversation between two people who have already spoken about the football thing. Additionally, the use of "сказал" (said) in the sentence correctly captures the meaning of "did you just say," which indicates surprise or disbelief.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Не важно, где мы, Джеймс. Важно лишь, почему ты здесь. Вы знаете, почему я убил дядю. Да, знаю.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. It means "Where we are is not important, James. What matters is why you're here. You know why I killed my uncle. Yes, I do." The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Мне знакомо это чувство. Нет, не знакомо. Я и подумать не мог, что когда-нибудь надену ей на палец кольцо. Но ведь надел."This is because the translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence in Russian. The first and second sentences of the translation are an accurate translation of "I know that feeling. No, you don't." The third sentence, "Я и подумать не мог, что когда-нибудь надену ей на палец кольцо" is an accurate translation of "I never thought in a million years I'd put a ring on her finger." The last sentence, "Но ведь надел" accurately translates "But you did" which means that he actually put a ring on her finger despite not expecting to.The other options presented contain various verbs that do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the original sentence. For example, "захотел" means "wanted", "сделал" means "did/made", "подумал" means "thought", "занялся" means "took up/start doing", "узнал" means "found out", "смог" means "could/succeeded", "поступил" means "behaved/acted", "помог" means "helped", "понял" means "understood" and "сказал" means "said".
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Вы видите перед собой... больного человека. Я хотела, чтобы вы это увидели. Поэтому сняла Лестера с препаратов, чтобы вы сами убедились в его невменяемости. И вы увидели.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The other options have incorrect verb forms and do not convey the same meaning.For example, the second option ("И вы сделали") translates to "And you did," which does not accurately convey the meaning of "And you saw it." The same applies to the other options which have incorrect verb forms or convey a different meaning than the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Мы с Кэмерон решили проводить еженедельные совещания, чтобы упростить интеграцию SwapMeet, и мы подумали, что ты будешь ценным дополнением. Да, конечно. Если ты хочешь. Да, мы хотим."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first part of the Russian sentence states that Cameron and the speaker have decided to have weekly meetings to streamline the integration of SwapMeet. The second part of the sentence indicates that the speaker thinks the person being addressed would be a valuable addition to these meetings, and that the speaker and Cameron want the person to attend. The translation uses the appropriate verb forms to convey the intended meaning, and the words chosen accurately reflect the tone and register of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Не хочешь поделиться? Если это станет серьезным, я сообщу. Ты не рассказал ему о Дейзи. Нет, не рассказал."This is because the correct translation should accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. Among the given options, the first one accurately translates the sentences and maintains the same meaning as the original English sentence. The other options have different verbs, tenses, or meanings that do not accurately convey the same meaning as the original sentence. Therefore, the correct translation is the first option: "Не хочешь поделиться? Если это станет серьезным, я сообщу. Ты не рассказал ему о Дейзи. Нет, не рассказал."
The correct Russian translation is: [Приятно знать, что он не возражает тратить время безутешной вдовы. - Когда это было? - Он тебе не сказал? Конечно, сказал.]This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "He didn't tell you? Yes, he did." implies that the speaker has already been informed about the situation, so the correct translation should reflect that. The other options, such as "he did it" or "he wanted to" or "he learned" do not accurately convey this information and would not be appropriate translations in this context.
The correct Russian translation is: [Умоляла меня. Мэтью не виноват. Он знает, что натворил. Вы оба натворили.]This is because the verb "to do" is translated as "натворить" in Russian, which means to cause trouble or mischief. None of the other options accurately convey the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, the verb "to make" (сделать) or "to say" (сказать) would not be appropriate in this context.
The correct Russian translation is: [Вы ранее заявили, что вы установили камеру, потому что вашу машину вскрыли? Верно. Вы нашли виновных? Полиция нашла, да.].This is the correct translation because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The word "нашла" in Russian translates to "found," which accurately conveys the idea that the police were able to identify and apprehend the perpetrators. The other options, such as "сделала" (did), "захотела" (wanted), or "подумала" (thought), do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Ты помнишь кто я такой? Джон. Конечно я помню. Но больше никто не помнит." This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, which is that the speaker remembers who the other person is, but no one else remembers. The other translations use verbs that do not fit the context of the sentence, such as "делает" (does), "хочет" (wants), "думает" (thinks), "занимается" (engages in), "знает" (knows), "может" (can), "поступает" (acts), "помогает" (helps), "понимает" (understands), and "говорит" (says).
The correct Russian translation is: "Но, на сколько мы знаем, Лэндон не преступник. По крайней мере пока. Ты сама сказала, что его мысли сами по себе преступление. Нет, не говорила."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The conversation is about whether or not Landon is a criminal, and one person suggests that Landon's thoughts could be considered a crime. The other person denies making that statement, indicating that they did not say Landon's thoughts were a crime. The Russian translation accurately conveys this exchange.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Нужно было письменное уведомление. Надо было это подготовить до их приезда. Ты никогда не думаешь наперед. Нет, думаю.]This translation is correct because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. Here's a breakdown of each part of the translation:    "Нужно было письменное уведомление" translates to "It had to be in writing," which conveys the idea that something needed to be communicated in written form.   "Надо было это подготовить до их приезда" translates to "You need the proof before they arrive," which implies that there is some kind of deadline or time constraint that requires preparation beforehand.   "Ты никогда не думаешь наперед" translates to "Don't you ever think ahead?" which is a rhetorical question asking if the person being spoken to is lacking foresight.   "Нет, думаю" translates to "Yes, I do," which is a response to the previous question indicating that the person does indeed think ahead.The other options provided for the Russian translation do not accurately convey the same meaning as the original English sentence. Some of the options include incorrect verbs or express different ideas entirely.
The correct Russian translation is: [Папа, Джейсон и Полли были обручены. Ты знал это? О боже. Конечно знал.].This is because the sentence in English is in the past tense, indicating that the speaker is referring to a past event. The verb "were engaged" is also in the past tense, which confirms that the event has already occurred. The Russian translation accurately conveys the past tense of the sentence and the knowledge that the speaker assumes the listener already has about the engagement.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: [Ну, может это он, но я ничего не говорил. Зои сказала Нику, и теперь он, вероятно, порвет со мной. Так что ты можешь сказать спасибо своей девушке за то, что критиковала меня. Клянусь, я не делал...].This translation is correct because it accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence, with the appropriate grammar and vocabulary choices. The other translations provided have different verb forms or vocabulary choices that alter the meaning of the original sentence or are not grammatically correct.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Ясно. Ты... Ты просил меня верить тебе. Я не верила."This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original sentence in English. The phrase "I didn't" in the English sentence indicates that the speaker did not trust the person who asked them to trust them. The phrase "Я не верила" in the Russian translation corresponds to this meaning, where "не верила" means "did not trust" in English.The other options listed in the question are not correct translations for the given sentence. They do not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence and would result in a different interpretation. For example, "Я не делала" means "did not do" in English and "Я не хотела" means "did not want" in English, which do not match the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Нет. Я уважал твоего отца. Больше, чем его собственный сын, которого он оставил. Но кто-то же сделал."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, where the speaker expresses their respect for the person's father, but implies that someone else was responsible for something negative happening. The word "сделал" (sdelal) means "did" or "made," which fits the context of the sentence where the speaker is referring to an action that was taken. The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence or use words that do not fit the context.
The correct Russian translation is: "Твою мать! Заклей ей рот, пожалуйста. Наглухо. Если сделаешь это, то умрет невиновный, а настоящий убийца будет на свободе."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, using the appropriate idiomatic expressions and vocabulary. The imperative verb "сделаешь" (do) in the conditional clause is the correct translation for "if you do" in this context. The use of the vulgar expression "Твою мать!" (Your mother!) reflects the frustration and urgency of the speaker in the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Не было ничего, что ты сделал или не сделал, Альфред. Почему я ушел. Я хочу чтобы ты узнал это. Я пойму." This is because "я пойму" means "I understand," which is an appropriate and natural response to the speaker wanting Alfred to know why they left. The other options offered do not convey the same meaning or fit in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Вы также должны были знать Роя Томкинса. Должна я? Он раньше работал у портье у мистера Нельсона. Многие боксеры так делают."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The verb "must" in the English sentence is translated as "должны были" in the Russian translation, which conveys the idea of obligation or necessity in the past. The word "too" in the English sentence is translated as "также", which means "also" in Russian. The phrase "used to work" is translated as "раньше работал", which conveys the idea of past habitual action. The word "doorman" is translated as "портье", which is the Russian equivalent of a doorman. The phrase "Plenty of boxers do" is translated as "Многие боксеры так делают", which conveys the idea that many boxers work as doormen.The other options provided do not accurately translate the English sentence, as they either use incorrect verb forms, incorrect vocabulary, or convey a different meaning than the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Привет, Челси. Спасибо, что согласилась встретиться. Я слышала, ты переехала в Нью-Йорк. Переехала, но там ничего не вышло.].This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The verb "moved" in the English sentence is translated to "переехала" in Russian, which means "moved" or "relocated". The other options provided in the question are incorrect because they use different verbs that do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "сделала" means "made", "захотела" means "wanted", "подумала" means "thought", "занялась" means "started", "узнала" means "found out", "смогла" means "could", "поступила" means "enrolled", "помогла" means "helped", "поняла" means "understood", and "сказала" means "said". None of these verbs accurately convey the meaning of "moved" in the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Это была исследовательская компания, тестировавшая новые лекарства. Вот неопровержимое доказательство. Вот что связывает Девида Лииса с UK Remicon. Связывало бы, если бы только Greenfern не закрылась 6 лет назад."This is because the phrase "It would do" in the English sentence is referring to the previous statement about Greenfern being closed down six years ago. This means that the correct translation should use the conditional form "Связывало бы" which means "it would link" instead of "делало бы" (it would do), "могло бы" (it could have), "помогало бы" (it would help), or "говорило бы" (it would say) in the other options.
Based on the context and meaning of the English sentence, the correct Russian translation is:[А теперь она, сука, в психушке. Я не знаю, что мне делать. Конечно же знаешь, сынок. Конечно же знаешь.]This translates to: "And now she's in a fucking mental hospital. I don't know what to do. Of course you know, son. Of course you know."The other options provided do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the English sentence. For example, "Конечно же делаешь" means "Of course you are doing it," which does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Similarly, "Конечно же хочешь" means "Of course you want to," which is not a suitable response to the situation presented.Therefore, the first translation provided is the most accurate one that captures the meaning and tone of the original English sentence.
The correct translation is: [Эссос это Восток, а Вестерос это Запад. Но что западнее Вестероса? Я не знаю. Никто не знает.].This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The sentence asks a rhetorical question about what lies to the west of Westeros, with the answer being that nobody knows. The word "знает" in the translation means "knows," which accurately reflects the meaning of the original sentence. The other options such as "делает" (does), "хочет" (wants), "думает" (thinks), "занимается" (is occupied), "может" (can), "поступает" (acts), "помогает" (helps), "понимает" (understands), and "говорит" (speaks) do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Но я упустила из вида то, почему вообще захотела работать с этими артистами, потому что потеряла из виду себя как артиста. И должна признать, что тур для Лейлы, вероятно, был для меня так же важен, как и для нее. Хочешь сделать 10 концертов просто ради этого? Да, я хочу.]Note: This translation was made based on the assumption that "Layla" is the name of a person, and therefore should not be translated. If "Layla" is a word in English that has a meaning in Russian, it should be translated accordingly.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Видишь ли, просто он, как ты, играли в роли судьи, присяжного и палача. Но Прометей лишил их власти. Если ты собираешься сделать со мной то же самое, то тебе придется придумать что-то лучше, чем это. Но я уже это сделал.]None of the options provided in the question matches the correct translation. The correct translation includes the phrase "играли в роли судьи, присяжного и палача" (played the role of judge, jury, and executioner) instead of "играли в судей и палачей" (played judges and executioners), which changes the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, the correct translation uses "Но я уже это сделал" (But I already did it) instead of "Я придумал", "Я сделал", "Я захотел", "Я занялся", "Я узнал", "Я смог", "Я поступил", "Я помог", or "Я сказал", which all have different meanings and do not accurately convey the intended message of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: [Всё это произошло сразу после того, как Мэри нашла кофту Эли. Да, и нас резко перестали допускать к ней. Может это потому что он не хочет, чтобы мы видели, что он делает с ней. Я видела, и это ужасно.]This is the correct translation because "я видела" (ya videla) is the correct Russian past tense form for "I saw" which matches the past tense in the original English sentence "I did, and it's awful." The other options provided are using incorrect forms of past tense verbs or other verbs that do not accurately convey the meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Ты уверена, что это хорошая мысль? Это шанс доказать твою ценность для команды и вытащить тебя из этой клетки. Ты разве этого не хочешь? Конечно, хочу, но...]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence while also using grammatically correct Russian language. The other options provided have various mistakes, such as using the wrong verb conjugation or using inappropriate vocabulary, which would make the sentences incorrect or unclear in Russian.
The correct Russian translation is: [По-моему, этому Корбену наплевать, если кто-то пострадает, пока на кону его интересы. Мы с Карой тоже там будем. Не думаешь, что вам двоим надо поговорить? Ну ты-то точно так думаешь.]This is because the word "думаешь" (dumayesh) in this option correctly translates to "do you think?" in English, which matches the meaning of the original sentence. The other options have different verbs that do not convey the same meaning, such as "делаешь" (delayesh) meaning "do you do?", "хочешь" (khochesh) meaning "do you want?", "занимаешься" (zanimaeshsya) meaning "do you occupy yourself with?", "можешь" (mozhesh) meaning "can you?", "поступаешь" (postupayesh) meaning "do you act?", "помогаешь" (pomogayesh) meaning "do you help?", "понимаешь" (ponimayesh) meaning "do you understand?", and "говоришь" (govorish) meaning "do you say?".
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Я же сказал, что сразу дам знать, если свяжутся. Да, за все это время ты много чего мне говорил, но не все оказывалось правдой. Мы вроде бы договорились, что ты не будешь настаивать, если я решу... Договорились."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options given do not accurately reflect the meaning of the sentence and could potentially be confusing or misleading to someone who is reading or hearing them. Therefore, the first option is the most appropriate translation for the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Нет. Кто его Вам дал? Ну... Рэд сказал."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. In English, the speaker is saying "No" to a question or statement that has not been explicitly stated, but presumably asked or suggested. Then, when asked who gave something to them, the speaker hesitates before finally answering "Red did."In the correct Russian translation, "Нет" is used to convey the same sense of negation as in the English sentence. The question "Кто его Вам дал?" is a direct translation of "who gave it to you?" and the pause before the answer is also conveyed by the use of "ну" which is a common filler word in Russian. Finally, the verb "сказал" is used to translate "did" in "Red did" which accurately conveys the meaning of the sentence as a whole.The other options include verbs such as "сделал" (did/made), "захотел" (wanted), "подумал" (thought), "занялся" (started), "узнал" (found out), "смог" (could), "поступил" (acted), "помог" (helped), and "понял" (understood). While some of these verbs could also be used to convey the meaning of the sentence in certain contexts, they do not accurately reflect the meaning and intent of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Сэр, я не контролирую то, что люди делают или говорят обо мне. Если ждёшь, что я сделаю тебе поблажку за твои нынешние злоключения, ты ошибаешься. Я ничего не жду. Думаю, что ты ждёшь.]This translation is the correct one because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The sentence is expressing the speaker's lack of control over other people's actions and words and their unwillingness to cut the listener any slack for their current misadventures. The speaker is also saying that they do not expect anything from the listener, but they believe that the listener does expect something.Among the options provided, only the last one ("думаю, что говоришь") is not an accurate translation, as it implies that the speaker is guessing what the listener is saying, which is not the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Кто-то видел, как она садилась в такси около клиники. Ее врач, её родители, мы все искали её несколько часов. Она не сказала вам, что поедет сюда? Нет, не сказала, поэтому..."This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options contain different verb forms that do not match the original sentence, such as "сделала" (did), "захотела" (wanted), "подумала" (thought), "занялась" (occupied), "узнала" (learned), "смогла" (could), "поступила" (acted), "помогла" (helped), and "поняла" (understood). None of these verbs convey the same meaning as "didn't tell," which is the appropriate translation of the verb "tell" in this context. Therefore, the first option is the correct translation.
I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot definitively say which of the given translations is correct, as it would depend on the context and intended meaning of the original English sentence. However, I can provide some analysis and insights that may help determine the most appropriate translation.In general, translating a sentence from one language to another requires careful consideration of many factors, such as grammar, syntax, semantics, and cultural context. Translating idiomatic expressions or nuanced phrases can be particularly challenging, as the meaning of the words may not directly correspond to their literal translation.To evaluate the accuracy of the given translations, one would need to compare the original English sentence with each of the translated versions, taking into account the intended meaning and the cultural context in which it was written. The best translation would be the one that most closely captures the original meaning, while also being grammatically correct and idiomatic in the target language.Without knowing the original context and intended meaning of the English sentence, it is difficult to say which of the given translations is most accurate. However, based solely on the grammar and syntax of the translations, it appears that some may be more grammatically correct and idiomatic than others.It is also worth noting that Russian, like any language, has multiple ways of expressing the same idea or concept. Therefore, different translations may be equally valid, depending on the specific phrasing and tone of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:Вы будете находиться под карантином здесь в течение 48 часов. Уберитесь с дороги. Я даже не трогал его. Я трогал.The correct translation for "Get out of my way" is "Уберитесь с дороги," and the correct translation for "I didn't even touch him" is "Я даже не трогал его." However, the translations for "I did" provided in the options are not accurate. The correct translation for "I did" in this context would be "Я трогал," which means "I touched him." None of the given options have this correct translation. Therefore, none of the provided options is correct.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Ладно. Да? Ты подумал над тем, что я говорила? Подумал."This is because "подумал" is the past tense form of the verb "to think" in Russian, which correctly translates the past tense form of the verb "did" in the English sentence. The other options provided are not correct because they do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the sentence. For example, "сделал" means "did" in the sense of completing an action, which does not fit the context of the sentence. Similarly, "захотел" means "wanted" and "занялся" means "started doing," which are not the intended meanings of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Спасибо, что приехали, шериф. Скажи, зачем я тут, Чанс. Вы слышали вердикт? Слышал.].This is because the translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is thanking the Sheriff for coming and asking Chance why they are there. Chance responds by asking if the speaker heard the verdict, to which the speaker confirms they did. The other translations include verbs that do not fit the context or do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct translation is: [Мэм, мне нужно поговорить с Кайлой. Вам нужно поговорить со мной, Брэндон. Вы не понимаете. Понимаю.].This is because "понимаю" is the correct Russian translation of "I do" in this context, which indicates that the speaker understands the situation despite Brandon's assertion that they don't. None of the other options provided accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Это из-за Джастина Фоули? Он тебя чем-то обидел? Нет, пап. Ведь, знаешь, если он обидел, я убью его.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The other options provided do not accurately capture the intended meaning, as they contain different verbs that do not match the context of the sentence. For example:    "Он тебя чем-то обидел?" (Did he offend you in some way?) is the correct translation for the question "He do something to you?", which implies that Justin may have done something wrong to the person speaking.   "если он сделал" (if he did) is not an appropriate translation for the context of the sentence, as it does not indicate what Justin might have done.   "если он захотел" (if he wanted) and "если он подумал" (if he thought) do not accurately reflect the implied threat in the sentence, which suggests that the speaker would harm Justin if he had done something wrong.   "если он занялся" (if he started), "если он узнал" (if he found out), "если он смог" (if he managed to), "если он поступил" (if he behaved), "если он помог" (if he helped), and "если он понял" (if he understood) are not appropriate translations for the context of the sentence and do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct translation is: [Мне просто жаль его. И тебя. Ты едва знаешь нас. Такое чувство, что знаю.]This is because the original sentence expresses the speaker's empathy towards someone and their situation. The phrase "feels like I do" indicates that the speaker has a strong sense of connection and understanding with the person they are talking to, even though they have only known each other for a short time. The Russian translation "такое чувство, что знаю" conveys this meaning accurately, as it implies that the speaker feels like they know the person well enough to empathize with them. The other options do not capture the same meaning and would not be accurate translations in this context.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [- Ты не можешь уйти. Я знала, что ты это скажешь. Они врали тебе. Да, но больше не врут.].This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is telling someone that they cannot quit, and when the other person responds, the speaker says that they knew the response was coming. The speaker then says that "they" (presumably someone the other person was working with) lied to them, but the speaker clarifies that they are not lying anymore.The other translations include words and phrases that do not fit the context or do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "but they're not anymore" would not be accurately translated as "they're not doing it anymore," "they don't want to anymore," "they're not thinking about it anymore," "they're not knowing anymore," "they're not able to anymore," "they're not acting anymore," "they're not helping anymore," "they're not understanding anymore," or "they're not speaking anymore."
The correct Russian translation is: [Ну, его могут посадить на несколько лет. Если он уже был судим, может даже на десятки лет. Вы не знаете, что случится, когда вы его найдете. Никто не знает.]This is because the correct translation accurately conveys the same meaning and tone as the original English sentence. The word choices and grammar used in the translation are appropriate for the context and meaning of the sentence.The other options contain incorrect word choices or grammar that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence. For example, using "делает" (option 2) instead of "знает" changes the meaning of the sentence to "Nobody does it" instead of "Nobody knows." Similarly, using "хочет" (option 3) changes the meaning to "Nobody wants to" instead of "Nobody knows," and using "думает" (option 4) changes the meaning to "Nobody thinks" instead of "Nobody knows."The other options (5-10) also contain incorrect word choices or grammar that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Огонь, технология, химия. Да, они думали это все магия, пока не узнали, как правильно пользоваться этим. Ты не знаешь как пользоваться магией. Не умеешь, так ведь?]The reason for this is that "you don't know how to use magic" in the English sentence is best translated to "ты не умеешь пользоваться магией" in Russian. While some of the other translations offered could be close in meaning, they do not accurately convey the same nuance and tone as the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Мы говорим о кандидате в середине выборов, где первый кандидат был убит. Так что у него максимальная защита. Тебе не удастся подойти к Ренару близко. И даже если ты сделаешь это, и убьешь его, ты будешь кончен.]
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Я тоже так думаю. Нет, я имею в виду "мило". В том смысле, что мой детектив работает над делом для тебя, и никто из вас не подумал сказать об этом мне. Я только что сказал."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is expressing their agreement with something that was said, but then correcting a misunderstanding by clarifying that they meant "nice" instead of whatever was previously mentioned. They then explain that their detective is working on a case for the person they are speaking to, and that neither of them had informed the speaker of this fact. The speaker then says that they are informing the person now. The Russian translation accurately captures all of these elements of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence "It was a kindness. For who? We couldn't go on, James. But you did." is: "Это было одолжением. Кому? Джеймс, мы не могли продолжать, но ты продолжил."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. The word "kindness" is translated as "одолжение" which means a favor or an act of kindness. The phrase "For who?" is translated as "Кому?" which means "for whom?" The sentence "We couldn't go on, James. But you did" is translated as "мы не могли продолжать, но ты продолжил" which means "we couldn't continue, but you did."None of the other translations provided accurately capture the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "Но ты сделал" means "but you did it" which doesn't convey the idea of "continuing" or "persevering" as in the original sentence. Similarly, "Но ты захотел" means "but you wanted to" which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [(прочищает горло) Я подарил ей колье вместо кольца. Понимаете, о чём я? Понимаю.].This is because "понимаю" is the correct translation for "I do" in this context, indicating agreement or understanding. The other options do not convey the same meaning and would not be appropriate translations in this context.
The correct Russian translation is: [Но в этом и дело. В этом и дело. Мэри, я верю, что она хочет помогать людям. Верю, верю, но Вы?]This translation accurately reflects the original English sentence. The repetition of "here's the thing" is translated as "в этом и дело" which conveys the same idea in Russian. The statement "Mary, I believe she wants to help people" is translated as "Мэри, я верю, что она хочет помогать людям" which is an accurate translation. The repeated phrase "I do, I do" is translated as "верю, верю" which captures the same meaning. Finally, the question "but you?" is translated as "но Вы?" which is a natural and accurate way to express the same question in Russian.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Они обе любят вас. А теперь послушайте меня... Они не любят меня. Любят."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is telling the listener that two people love them, but then goes on to say that these two people do not love the speaker, which is contradicted by the listener who says "Yes, they do." The word "любят" in the correct translation means "love" and is the appropriate verb to use in this context. None of the other options provided convey the same meaning or are appropriate in this context.
The correct Russian translation is:[Я восхищался ею. Гораздо больше, чем её муж или сын. Думаешь, мне есть дело, до того, кого ты восхищаешься, а кого нет? Нет, я не имею дела, но я всё равно говорю тебе об этом, потому что ты мой пленник.]This is because the correct translation should accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. The given sentence is spoken by someone who is addressing their prisoner, and they are stating that they admired a woman more than her husband or son. They then ask the prisoner if they think it matters to them whom the speaker admires or doesn't admire, and answer their own question by saying that they are telling the prisoner anyway because they are their captive.Among the options given, only the first translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence. The other translations have various errors in grammar, vocabulary, or word order that make them incorrect or awkward. For example, some of the translations use the wrong verb or preposition, while others have incorrect word order or incorrect verb conjugation. Therefore, option 1 is the correct translation.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Мы продержались так долго не благодаря тому, что поддавались поспешным решениям. Да, ведь действовать - не в вашем духе, правда? Вы хотя бы искали меня? Конечно искали."This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first part of the sentence states that the speakers have survived for a long time by avoiding rash decisions. The second part of the sentence is a sarcastic comment, suggesting that the person being addressed does not take action easily. The third part of the sentence is a question, asking if the person being addressed looked for the speakers, and the fourth part of the sentence is an affirmation that they did look for the speakers.The other options provided in the question contain verbs that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence. For example, "делали" (option 2) means "did," but it does not convey the sense of actively searching for someone. Similarly, "думали" (option 4) means "thought," but it does not convey the sense of actually looking for someone. Only option 1 accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is:[Ты помнишь игру в прятки, когда мы были детьми? Ты говоришь это потому что ты жульничал? Я этого не делал. еще как делал]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options either use incorrect verb forms or incorrect words, which changes the meaning of the sentence. For example, "еще как хотел" (option 2) means "wanted it badly," which does not fit the context of the sentence. Similarly, "еще как знал" (option 5) means "knew it well," which is not relevant to the sentence. Option 7, "еще как поступал," means "acted differently," which also changes the meaning of the sentence. The correct translation (option 1) uses the verb form "делал" which means "did" in English and accurately conveys the meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Если ты хочешь доказать свою невиновность, доставь мисс Белкорт Конклаву. Вы думаете, я не пытался? Я хочу вам верить, Мистер Сантьяго, но как ни печально... Я не уверен, что верю.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided have different verbs and do not convey the intended meaning. For example, "Я не уверен, что делаю" means "I'm not sure I'm doing it", while "Я не уверен, что думаю" means "I'm not sure I'm thinking". These translations do not convey the speaker's uncertainty about believing the person and are therefore incorrect.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[На этом видео тот же подросток, что и на нескольких до этого. Очевидно, его семья принесла старую плёнку в Стоун-Пост, чтобы оцифровать. Сомневаюсь, что они знали, что у них в руках. Аарон, очевидно, знал.]This is the correct translation because the last sentence in the English text is "Aaron obviously did," which implies that Aaron knew something that the teenager's family did not know. The word "did" indicates that Aaron took action or had a specific knowledge about something. Out of the given options, only "знал" (knew) accurately reflects the meaning of "did" in this context. The other options such as "делал" (did/made), "хотел" (wanted), "думал" (thought), "занимался" (was occupied with), "мог" (could), "поступал" (acted), "помогал" (helped), "понимал" (understood), and "говорил" (spoke) do not accurately convey the meaning of "did" in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Я не собираюсь сидеть тут и говорить вам с Морганом, что брак - это устаревшая концепция, а потом жениться на нем. - Да, но ты любишь его, не так ли? - Конечно, люблю."This is because this translation accurately conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence, without changing the intended message. It uses the correct grammar and vocabulary to express the same ideas as the English sentence. All the other options provided in the question contain incorrect grammar, vocabulary or sentence structure, and do not convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Я не знаю про эту. Ты знал, как сделать это секунду назад, а сейчас не знаешь? Я не знаю, папа. Думаю, знаешь."This translation accurately captures the meaning and tone of the original English sentence. The other options either change the meaning of the sentence or use inappropriate words that do not fit the context.For example, "Думаю, делаешь" (I think you are doing it) and "Думаю, хочешь" (I think you want it) both change the meaning of the sentence by suggesting that the father is currently doing or wanting something, which is not implied in the original sentence. Similarly, "Думаю, занимаешься" (I think you are busy), "Думаю, можешь" (I think you can), "Думаю, поступаешь" (I think you are acting), "Думаю, помогаешь" (I think you are helping), "Думаю, понимаешь" (I think you understand), and "Думаю, говоришь" (I think you are saying) all use words that do not fit the context or the meaning of the original sentence. Therefore, the correct translation is the first option provided.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Не надо убегать от этого. Прими. Я не хочу становиться другим. Думаю, хочешь."This translation captures the meaning of the original English sentence accurately. The first sentence "You don't have to run from that. You can embrace it" is translated as "Не надо убегать от этого. Прими" which means "You don't have to run from it. Embrace it." The second sentence "I don't want to be someone else. I think you do" is translated as "Я не хочу становиться другим. Думаю, хочешь." which means "I don't want to become someone else. I think you do."
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Знаете, моя семья очень помогла Карлосу, и теперь ему нужно помочь нам, так что просто скажите ему связаться с моим братом. Я даже не знаю, услышу ли о нём ещё. - Но если услышите? - Если услышу, скажу ему, что вы заходили.]This translates back to English as:[You know, my family has helped Carlos a lot, and now we need him to help us, so just tell him to contact my brother. I don't even know if I'll hear from him again. - But if you hear from him? - If I do, I'll tell him you came by.]
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Что привело тебя сюда? Я приехала за сыном. - Он сказал, вы встречались. - Встречались.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. The verb "встречались" in Russian means "met" in English and matches the past tense form of the verb "met" used in the original sentence. The other options presented in the question are either incorrect or do not match the context of the sentence. For example, "делали" means "did," "хотели" means "wanted," "думали" means "thought," "занимались" means "were engaged in," "знали" means "knew," "могли" means "could," "поступали" means "behaved," "помогали" means "helped," "понимали" means "understood," and "говорили" means "spoke." None of these verbs accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Это был всего лишь флирт. Откуда тебе знать? Босс никогда не просил тебя принарядиться, чтобы впечатлить инвестора. А если бы попросил, я бы с радостью это сделал.].This translation is the most accurate because it conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence. The word "poprosil" (попросил) means "asked" in English, which matches the meaning of "told" in the original sentence. The word "prinaraditsya" (принарядиться) means "dress up" in English, which is the same as "sex yourself up" in the original sentence. The phrase "s radostyu eto sdelal" (с радостью это сделал) means "would do so happily" in English, which matches the meaning of the last part of the original sentence. Overall, this translation accurately conveys the meaning and tone of the original English sentence in Russian.
The correct Russian translation is:[Как ты себя чувствуешь? Как вкусно пахнет. Думаешь он меня знает? Конечно знает.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The person being spoken to is asked how they are feeling, and the response is that someone (presumably nearby) smells like heaven. The second question asks if the person thinks this other individual knows them, and the response is "of course he does."The other translations listed do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original sentence. For example, some of the translations include verbs that do not make sense in the given context, such as "делает" (does), "хочет" (wants), "думает" (thinks), "занимается" (is busy with), "может" (can), "поступает" (acts), "помогает" (helps), and "говорит" (speaks). None of these verbs accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct translation is: [Да нет. Да-да. Как ты поняла? Не знаю, но поняла.].This is because the sentence "No, there isn't. Yes, there is. How do you know that? I don't know, but I do." expresses a contradiction and uncertainty followed by an affirmation. The translation should reflect the same meaning and tone as the original sentence.The options that include verbs like "сделала" (did), "захотела" (wanted), "подумала" (thought), "занялась" (started), "узнала" (found out), "смогла" (managed to), "поступила" (acted), "помогла" (helped), and "сказала" (said) do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the sentence. The option that includes "но поняла" (but I understood) is the most appropriate because it accurately captures the sense of contradiction and uncertainty followed by an affirmation expressed in the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Ты хоть понимаешь, с кем связался? Понимаю. Детектив Риггс - это Дилан Эшворт. Теперь и он понимает."This is because the translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is warning someone that they have no idea who they are dealing with, and then introduces Detective Riggs as a way of emphasizing this point. The final sentence "Now he does, too" indicates that Dylan Ashworth now understands the gravity of the situation. The word "понимает" in the translation correctly conveys the meaning of "understands" in this context.
The correct Russian translation is: [Привет. Думал, что сможешь уехать не попрощавшись? Ты же знаешь, я терпеть не могу прощаться. Знаю.]This is because the Russian translation accurately conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence. The speaker is expressing their displeasure at the fact that the person they're speaking to is leaving without saying goodbye. The speaker then goes on to express their dislike for goodbyes. The word "знаю" in the Russian translation means "I know," which is the appropriate response to the statement "you know I hate goodbyes."
The correct Russian translation for the English sentence "{Troy. Hey, Brick. - You see me play? - I did.}" is "{Трой. Здорово, Брик. - Видел, как я играл? - Видел.}".This translation correctly conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence. It includes the names "Troy" and "Brick" and the question "You see me play?" which is answered with "I did." The Russian words used in the translation accurately capture the intended meaning of the English words.
The correct Russian translation is: "Аннабель? Что-то не так. Она бы не покинула свой дом. Оне не покидала."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is expressing concern about Annabelle, who has apparently left her home. However, the speaker then clarifies that Annabelle did not actually leave her home, so something else must be wrong.The other translations provided do not accurately convey this meaning. For example, "Оне не делала" (she did not do) or "Оне не занималась" (she was not doing) do not make sense in this context and would not be an accurate translation. Similarly, "Оне не хотела" (she did not want) or "Оне не думала" (she did not think) do not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [— Она другая. — В смысле? Я не знаю. Знаешь.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker initially says "She's different," to which the listener responds, "Different how?" The speaker then says "I don't know," but the listener insists, "Yes, you do." The correct translation uses the word "знаешь" (know) in the third sentence, which means "you know," conveying the insistence of the listener that the speaker does indeed know how the person is different.
The correct translation is: [Тогда почему Роман опознал её? Ты – агент контрразведки. У тебя были годы, чтобы разорвать шпионскую сеть. Ты не разорвала, почему?]This is because the verb "разорвать" (razorvat') means "to break/to sever/to tear apart", which fits the context of the sentence and conveys the idea of "busting" the spy ring. The other verb options given in the other translations do not fit as well with the context or do not convey the same idea.
The correct Russian translation for the English sentence "It was totally inappropriate. I feel it, too. I have for a while. I just didn't..." is:"Это было неуместно. Но я тоже все это чувствую. Уже некоторое время. Просто я не говорила..."This translation captures the meaning of the original sentence most accurately. The word "говорила" means "said" or "spoken", and in this context, it implies that the speaker did not express their feelings about the inappropriateness of the situation. This fits well with the rest of the sentence, where the speaker admits to feeling the same way for a while but not expressing it.The other options offered in the question use different verbs that do not convey the same meaning as the English original. For example, "делала" means "did", "хотела" means "wanted", "думала" means "thought", and so on. None of these verbs capture the sense of the speaker having felt something but not expressed it.
The correct Russian translation is: "Вам стоит кое-что знать. Что? Иран не хочет ядерного оружия. Никогда не хотел." This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. The phrase "it never did" implies that Iran never wanted a nuclear weapon, and the Russian verb "хотел" (wanted) correctly conveys this meaning. The other options use verbs like "делал" (did), "думал" (thought), "занимался" (engaged in), "знал" (knew), "мог" (could), "поступал" (acted), "помогал" (helped), "понимал" (understood), and "говорил" (said), which do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Я ухожу на пенсию и я уже упомянул тебя парню, который принимает здесь решения, так что... Погоди. Я знаю, ты обожаешь быть копом, Роджер. Я тоже любил].This is because "I did, too" in the original sentence implies that the speaker also loved being a cop, and the most appropriate Russian word to convey this meaning is "любить" (to love). The other options provided are not as appropriate, as they use words like "делать" (to do), "хотеть" (to want), "думать" (to think), "заниматься" (to be engaged in), "знать" (to know), "мочь" (to be able to), "помогать" (to help), "понимать" (to understand), and "говорить" (to speak), which do not convey the same sense of enjoyment and passion for being a cop as the word "любить".
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я не гожусь быть копом, капитан. Если бы вы меня там не отговорили... Я реально собирался нажать на курок. Но не нажал.]The key difference between the correct translation and the other options provided is the use of the correct verb form for "I had every intention of pulling that trigger" in the past tense. The verb "собиралась" (sobiralas') in the correct translation is the correct past tense form of the verb "собираться" (sobiratsya), which means "to intend to do something" or "to be about to do something." The other verb forms, such as "сделала" (sdelala), "захотела" (zakhotela), "подумала" (podumala), "занялась" (zanyalas'), "узнала" (uznala), "смогла" (smogla), "поступила" (postupila), "помогла" (pomogla), and "поняла" (ponyala), do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence. Therefore, the correct translation is the first option provided.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [И действительно амбициозен Я не спорю, капитан, но я могу подождать. И мне нравится моя жизнь такой, какая она есть, понимаете? Да, понимаю].This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The Russian words used in this translation correspond to the correct meaning of the English words, and the grammar is also correct. The word "понимаете?" translates to "you know?" in English, which is an accurate translation of the English sentence's intended meaning. The other options provided in the question either use incorrect words or incorrect grammar, resulting in inaccurate translations of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Джульета, мы делаем так, как можем. Ты знаешь, во сколько обойдется дом престарелых? Я думала, ты нанял девушку заботиться о ней. Сана заботится.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The verb "заботиться" (to take care of) is the appropriate verb to describe what Sana'a is doing for Julieta's mother. The other options presented in the multiple-choice question, such as "делает" (does), "хочет" (wants), "думает" (thinks), "занимается" (is engaged in), "знает" (knows), "может" (can), "поступает" (acts), "помогает" (helps), "понимает" (understands), and "говорит" (speaks) are not suitable in the context of the sentence and do not accurately convey the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:["Найдите человека со способностями и убейте". Но потом появились вы, и мы наконец-то увидели настоящего, живого урода, испускающего ударные волны. Вот только мы не думали, что это была маленькая скромная девушка. Если бы мы знали, то вместо этого преследовали бы тебя.]This translates back to the given English sentence as:"Get a powered person and kill it." But then you all were there, and we finally got to see a real, live freak emitting shock waves. Only thing is, we didn't think it was a tiny, unassuming little girl. If we knew, we would have pursued you instead."
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Нет, но Элис учила. Никак не припомнить. Так учила или нет? Учила.]This translation captures the meaning of the original English sentence accurately. The word "but" in the English sentence suggests that the speaker is negating something that was said previously, and in this case, the speaker is denying that they did something. The Russian word "нет" (no) at the beginning of the sentence also suggests a negation.The English sentence then goes on to say "but I think Alice did." This is accurately translated as "но Элис учила" (but Alice did). The verb "учила" (taught) corresponds to the English "did."The next part of the sentence, "Hmm, uh, can't remember," is translated as "Никак не припомнить," which means "can't remember."The question "Did she or didn't she?" is translated as "Так учила или нет?" which means "Did she teach or not?"Finally, the sentence ends with "She did, uh," which is translated as "Учила," which means "she taught."Overall, this translation captures the meaning of the original English sentence accurately and uses appropriate vocabulary and grammar in Russian to express the same idea.
The correct Russian translation is: "Я этого не делал. Это сделала ты. О, нет. Ты сам это сделал." This translation captures the meaning of the original English sentence accurately, conveying that the speaker did not do the action in question, but rather the other person did it. The use of the verb "сделал" (did) in the last sentence emphasizes that the other person is the one who actually performed the action. The other translations suggest different interpretations that do not accurately reflect the original meaning of the sentence.
The correct translation is: "Сразу перед тем, как меня вернули сюда. Вы так долго были его возлюбленной и не знали? Вам не мешает табачный дым? А я вижу, что это так."This translation captures the meaning of the original sentence more accurately than the other options. The first sentence is translated as "Just before I was brought back here," which is a literal translation and conveys the same meaning as the original sentence. The second sentence is translated as "All that time, you were his mistress and you didn't know?" which is also an accurate translation of the original sentence. The third sentence is translated as "Does the smoke bother you? I can see that it does," which captures the meaning of the original sentence.The other translations are not correct because they either use incorrect grammar, incorrect vocabulary, or do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. For example, some of the translations use verbs that are not appropriate for the context, or use words that are not appropriate for the meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Тебе, Джон? Великому и Могучему? Помнишь, как однажды ты избивал меня, пока костяшки не стесал? Помню.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence in Russian, without introducing any new meanings or mistranslations. The other options provided do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the sentence or contain errors in grammar or word choice.For example, the option "Делаю" means "doing" in English, which does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Similarly, "Хочу" means "want" in English, which also does not fit the context of the sentence. The other options like "Думаю", "Занимаюсь", "Знаю", "Могу", "Поступаю", "Помогаю", "Понимаю", and "Говорю" also do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct translation is: [Не один раз, не два. Три раза. Я пытался спасти его. Я пытался.].This is the correct translation because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original sentence. The speaker is emphasizing that they tried to save someone three times, and that they really did try their best. The verb "пытался" (tried) is the most appropriate translation for "tried" in this context. Other translations, such as "делал" (did) or "хотел" (wanted), do not convey the same emphasis on the speaker's efforts to save the person.
The correct Russian translation is:[Если я смогу вернуть их, отдав ему деньги... Два визита в месяц под контролем враждебно настроенного социального работника? Боритесь, особенно если дети так дороги вам, как вы говорите. - Конечно, дороги.]This is because the word "mean" in the original English sentence is being used as a verb to express the idea that the children are important to the speaker. The most appropriate Russian verb to convey this meaning is "дороги," which means "are dear" or "are precious." None of the other verbs in the list provided capture this meaning accurately. Additionally, there is a minor error in the Russian sentence, where "по контролем" should be changed to "под контролем" to reflect proper grammar.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:"На карточке ничего нет. Ты меня дурачишь прямо сейчас. Клянусь Богом, я их не отправлял. Я точно выясню, кто это сделал."The first option provided is the correct one, while the other options contain different verbs and nouns that do not correctly convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence. For example, in some of the other options, words like "захотел" (wanted), "подумал" (thought), "занялся" (engaged), and "смог" (was able to) are used instead of "сделал" (did), which changes the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, some of the other options contain grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that make them incorrect translations of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Адам Фолли, ты женишься на мне? Снова? Ого, этого я не ожидал. Я знал.]This is because "я знал" (ya znal) means "I knew" in English, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options provided in the question, such as "я делал" (ya delal) meaning "I did" or "я помогал" (ya pomogal) meaning "I helped," do not make sense in this context. The speaker is expressing surprise that Adam Foley is proposing marriage again, and then confirms that they knew it was going to happen. Therefore, "я знал" (ya znal) is the correct translation.
The correct Russian translation is: [Меня так взбесил Джефф. И Ханна, за то, что она все драматизировала. Я не знал. Ну, теперь знаешь.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is expressing their anger towards Jeff and Hannah, specifically blaming Hannah for making the situation more dramatic than it needed to be. The speaker then admits that they were previously unaware of the situation, but now the listener is aware of what has happened. None of the other translations accurately convey this meaning.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Какой ты милый и страшный созданец. Во всём великолепен. Ты меня не знаешь. Но я знаю тебя." The correct translation reflects the meaning of the original sentence, while the provided options do not match the intended meaning or contain incorrect grammar.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Выдвижение Далтона - это самое серьезное предательство на моей памяти, и я не собираюсь быть причастным к этому. Ваша работа в МИДе не влияет на политику. Неэтично с вашей стороны, срывать важную сделку, которую вы сами же организовали... Чертовски верно, организовал все это я, без вашей помощи!"This is because the phrase "You're damn right I did, no thanks to you!" in the English sentence translates to "Чертовски верно, организовал все это я, без вашей помощи!" in Russian, which is only found in the first option. The other options contain variations of this phrase that do not match the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [6:00. Мы с Келлом встаём первыми. Ох, мы пропустили хорошее. Нет, вы не пропустили.]This translation is correct because it accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence in Russian. The Russian sentence translates to "We are the first ones up with Kell. Oh, we missed the good stuff. No, you didn't." The sentence reflects the same structure and meaning as the original English sentence, conveying that the speaker and Kell woke up early and missed out on something good, but reassuring the listener that they did not actually miss out.The other options provided for translation contain various incorrect word choices and meanings that do not match the intended message of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [А фильм Мендеса "Выстоять и сделать" был перебор? Хотя да, был. Так, будь суровым, как будто тебя задолбало следовать указаниям белых людей. Уж это-то я смогу.].This translation is the most accurate because it correctly conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "act angry, like you're sick of taking orders from the white man" is translated as "будь суровым, как будто тебя задолбало следовать указаниям белых людей" which captures the intended meaning of the phrase. The verb "смогу" (can do) in the final sentence of the Russian translation also accurately reflects the tone and sentiment of the original sentence. The other options do not accurately convey the intended meaning and tone of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the English sentence is: [Рыбы в бочке. Можно и так сказать. Только рыбы не знали, что они вскоре умрут. Эти же люди знали.]This is because the phrase "These men did" in the original sentence indicates that the men being referred to knew they were going to die. The Russian phrase "Эти же люди знали" correctly translates this meaning into Russian.The other translations do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence. For example, "These same men made" (second option) or "These same men wanted" (third option) do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Similarly, "These same men were thinking" (fourth option) or "These same men were occupied with" (fifth option) do not convey the sense of knowledge about their impending death. The remaining options ("These same men could", "These same men acted", "These same men helped", "These same men understood", and "These same men spoke") do not capture the sense of certainty or awareness expressed in the original sentence.
As an AI language model, I must provide an objective and non-judgmental response. However, I must note that the given English sentence contains violent and aggressive language that promotes unacceptable behavior. It is not appropriate to encourage or justify physical violence as a means of resolving conflicts.Regarding the Russian translations provided, the first option is the correct translation of the given English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Улыбался и лгал для вас? Информация должна управляться в кризис. Я думал, вы это поняли. О, я понял."This is because the correct Russian translation uses the correct verb tense, agreement, and word choice to accurately convey the meaning of the English sentence. Specifically:    "Регулироваться" (regulate) in the options provided is not the most appropriate verb here, as it does not fully capture the meaning of "managed" in English. "Управляться" (to manage) is a more accurate translation.    "Я сделал" (I did) and "Я захотел" (I wanted) are not appropriate translations for "Oh, I do." The correct translation is "О, я понял" (Oh, I understood).    The correct form of the verb "понимать" (to understand) in the third person past tense is "понял" (understood), not "подумал" (thought), "смог" (could), "поступил" (acted), "узнал" (found out), "занялся" (took up), "помог" (helped), or "сказал" (said).Therefore, the correct Russian translation is "Улыбался и лгал для вас? Информация должна управляться в кризис. Я думал, вы это поняли. О, я понял."
The correct Russian translation is: [Ты спросил: "Что случится, если лучшие агенты в мире захотят что-то сделать?" "Они это сделают." Ещё как сделают.].This is because "ещё как" is a colloquial expression in Russian that is used to express agreement or emphasis. It can be translated to "damn right" or "absolutely" in English, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options presented do not accurately convey the intended meaning and tone of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Это... ранние годы вашей карьеры в качестве криминального гения. Когда вас и Джеймса Лэма арестовали за вымогательство. Только Лэм не попал в тюрьму, а вы попали."None of the options provided in the question matches the correct translation. The correct translation uses "вашей карьеры в качестве криминального гения" (your career as a criminal genius) instead of "бытия преступником" (being a criminal). Additionally, the correct translation uses "попал" (got) instead of "сел" (sat) to refer to James Lam not going to prison, and "попали" (got) instead of "сели" (sat) to refer to the person who did go to prison.Therefore, none of the options provided is correct, and the correct Russian translation is: "Это... ранние годы вашей карьеры в качестве криминального гения. Когда вас и Джеймса Лэма арестовали за вымогательство. Только Лэм не попал в тюрьму, а вы попали."
None of the provided translations is an accurate translation of the given English sentence. The translations all contain the phrase "Ты сдашь нам русских, Джимми," which means "You will surrender the Russians to us, Jimmy," but this phrase is not present in the original sentence. Additionally, the translations differ in the word choice and grammar used to convey the hypothetical scenarios presented in the English sentence.A correct translation of the given English sentence into Russian could be:"Тебе нужно отказаться от русских, Джимми. Убирайся отсюда, пока не поздно. Если не уйдешь, то ты скоро окажешься в беде. А я, если не откажусь, то сам скоро окажусь на дне Говануса."This translation conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, including the commands and hypothetical scenarios presented in the English version, while also being grammatically correct and idiomatic in Russian.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Они даже не знают его имя. У вас был мотив, и у нас есть основания полагать, что Тенду раскрыл имена всех ваших боссов. Он угрожал раскрыть всех вас. Он сделал, но он также предложил мне сделку, которую я приняла.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The key elements of the sentence, such as "They don't even know his name," "Tendu uncovered the names of all your bosses," and "He threatened to expose all of you," are all present and correctly translated in the Russian sentence. Additionally, the use of the verb "сделал" (did) in the Russian translation correctly conveys the meaning of the sentence, indicating that Tendu followed through on his threat to expose the bosses, but also offered the speaker a deal.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Реальность - это вопрос восприятия. Они ощущают это как реальность, поэтому для них это и есть реальность. Они могут не верить этому. Да, но я верю.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The key phrases "Reality is just perception" and "They perceive it as real, which makes it real" are translated as "Реальность - это вопрос восприятия" and "Они ощущают это как реальность, поэтому для них это и есть реальность" respectively, which convey the idea that reality is subjective and depends on one's perception of it. The phrase "Yeah, but I do" is translated as "Да, но я верю," which accurately reflects the speaker's belief in the subjective nature of reality. None of the other answer options capture the correct meaning of the sentence, and some of them introduce entirely different ideas that are not present in the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: "Я знаю, у нас была отличная команда. Но это не меняет того факта, что ты врала мне ради моей симпатии к тебе. Что ж, это верно. Врала."This is because "врала" is the past tense of the verb "врать," which means "to lie" in English. This is the appropriate verb tense to use in this context, as the speaker is referring to a specific instance of the other person lying to them in the past. The other verbs in the options provided do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence in English.

The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Харви. У меня еще один вопрос: клялись ли вы хранить верность мистеру Россу в течение вашего брака? Да, клялась.]This is because the verb "vow" in the English sentence is translated as "клясться" in Russian, which means "to swear" or "to take an oath". The correct form of the verb to match the gender of the speaker is "клялась" (for a female speaker) or "клялся" (for a male speaker), which is used in the given Russian translation.The other options provided in the question use different verbs such as "делать" (to do), "хотеть" (to want), "думать" (to think), "заниматься" (to be engaged in), "знать" (to know), "мочь" (to be able to), "поступать" (to act), "помогать" (to help), "понимать" (to understand), and "говорить" (to speak), which do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is:[Родители открыли его около 50 лет назад. Мы с братом стали здесь работать где-то 5 лет назад, после смерти родителей. Ваши родители когда-то либо видели монстра? Отец клялся, что видел.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:    [Отец клялся, что делал] - This translates to "Father swore that he did," which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.   [Отец клялся, что хотел] - This translates to "Father swore that he wanted," which also doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.   [Отец клялся, что думал] - This translates to "Father swore that he thought," which doesn't accurately convey the idea that the father saw the monster.   [Отец клялся, что занимался] - This translates to "Father swore that he was busy," which again doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.   [Отец клялся, что знал] - This translates to "Father swore that he knew," which is close in meaning to the correct translation, but doesn't convey the idea that the father actually saw the monster.   [Отец клялся, что мог] - This translates to "Father swore that he could," which is again close in meaning to the correct translation, but doesn't accurately convey the idea that the father saw the monster.   [Отец клялся, что поступал] - This translates to "Father swore that he acted," which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.   [Отец клялся, что помогал] - This translates to "Father swore that he helped," which doesn't accurately convey the idea that the father saw the monster.   [Отец клялся, что понимал] - This translates to "Father swore that he understood," which doesn't accurately convey the idea that the father saw the monster.   [Отец клялся, что говорил] - This translates to "Father swore that he said," which again doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Но романтики от одеяла не дождешься. Я не хочу, чтобы меня обслюнявливали, если ты об этом. Ну не все они слюнявят же. До сих пор не встречала ни одного, чтобы не слюнявил.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "You can't get romantic with a blanket" is translated as "Но романтики от одеяла не дождешься," which means "But you can't expect romance from a blanket." The phrase "I don't want someone slobbering all over me if that's what you mean" is translated as "Я не хочу, чтобы меня обслюнявливали, если ты об этом," which means "I don't want to be slobbered all over if that's what you mean." The phrase "They don't all slobber" is translated as "Ну не все они слюнявят же," which means "Well, not all of them slobber." Finally, the phrase "Oh, never met one yet that didn't" is translated as "До сих пор не встречала ни одного, чтобы не слюнявил," which means "Until now, I haven't met one that didn't slobber." Therefore, the correct translation is the one that accurately reflects the meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[- Это правда? - Почему ты спрашиваешь? Потому что я должна убедиться, что наше решение подождать не привело эту женщину в инвалидное кресло. Нет, не привело.]This is because the word "put" in the original sentence is translated as "привело" which means "led to" or "resulted in" in Russian. The other options provided do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "не сделало" means "didn't do it", "не смогло" means "couldn't do it", "не помогло" means "didn't help", and "не сказало" means "didn't say it".
The correct Russian translation is: "Я Тед. Пёс. Вы сказали "Пёс"? Сказал."This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the original sentence, where the speaker confirms that his name is Ted and that he has a dog when asked about it. The word "сказал" in the translation means "said" and is the appropriate verb to use in this context to indicate that the speaker confirmed the information. The other options provided do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct translation would be: [Полиция, суд... Свидетельствовать против сына правительственного советника... Она потеряет Алладина если она этого не сделает. Она будет подвергаться воздействию, если она согласится.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is discussing a situation where a woman is being asked to testify against the son of a government advisor, and is faced with a difficult choice: if she doesn't testify, she will lose Aladdin (presumably a person she cares about), but if she does testify, she will be exposed to some negative consequence. The phrase "she'll be exposed" in the original sentence suggests that there is some sort of risk or negative consequence associated with testifying, and the phrase "if she does" indicates that this risk will only materialize if she goes ahead with it. The phrase "she'll lose Aladdin" suggests that there is something she stands to lose if she doesn't testify, but it's not clear exactly what that is from the given context. The phrase "a court of law" implies that this is a legal matter, and the presence of the police also suggests that this is a serious situation. Overall, the translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Нет. Думаю, ты не стала бы просить меня найти твою биологическую мать, считая, что она могла его убить. Я не знала, что он мёртв, когда просила об этом. И правда, не знала.]This is because the other translations contain different verb forms that do not match the tense or aspect of the original English sentence. For example, "не делала" means "did not do" which implies a specific action in the past, whereas the English sentence uses "did not know" which refers to a lack of knowledge, not a lack of action. Similarly, "не хотела" means "did not want to" which also implies a specific action, whereas the English sentence does not suggest any reluctance or desire to act.The correct translation uses the past tense "знала" (knew) to match the tense of "didn't know" in the English sentence. Additionally, the use of the adverb "правда" (truthfully) accurately conveys the speaker's intention to clarify their lack of knowledge in the situation.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Откуда тебе знать, что я не хочу проткнуть тебя этим колом? А ты хочешь? Нет. Я хочу.]This is because the correct translation should convey the same meaning as the original sentence in English. The other options presented do not accurately reflect the meaning of the sentence.The key words in the sentence are "How do you know" and "No, I do". These words suggest that the speaker of the sentence actually wants to stake the person they are talking to, even though the person they are talking to does not believe this to be the case.The correct Russian translation conveys this same meaning, with the use of the word "хочу" (I want) to indicate that the speaker actually does want to stake the other person, even though they are denying it. The other options presented do not accurately reflect this intention and meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[И как только он дал ей номер... Она убила Джорджа. Номер доступа имеет что-то общее со свадьбой? Ну, если и имеет, теперь это бесполезно.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options do not make sense in the given context or do not accurately capture the intended meaning of the sentence. For example, options like "if it wants" or "if it helps" do not make sense in the context of a phone number being related to a wedding. Similarly, options like "if it thinks" or "if it speaks" do not accurately capture the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Ты и Мэри Гудвин? Да, и мне не нравится твой тон. Когда я услышал об отце, я ни на секунду не поверил, что он покончил с собой. И, честно говоря, Дюваль, я разочарован, что ты поверил.]This translation accurately reflects the meaning and tone of the original sentence in English. The verb "поверил" (poveril) means "believed", which is the correct verb to use in this context to convey that Duval believed that the father had killed himself. The other verb options such as "сделал" (sdelal) meaning "did" or "захотел" (zakhotel) meaning "wanted" or "занялся" (zanyalsya) meaning "engaged" do not fit the context of the sentence and change the intended meaning of the statement. Therefore, the first option is the most accurate translation of the given English sentence into Russian.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:"Людовик уже умирает. Я надеюсь, у тебя нет сомнений, Ферон? Ты просишь меня убить своего брата! Если ты не убьешь, он раскроет твое предательство и повесит тебя."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options have some grammatical errors or incorrect word choices that would change the meaning of the sentence or make it unclear. For example, using "займешься" would mean "if you don't take care of it," which is not the same as "if you don't do it," and "если ты не узнаешь" would mean "if you don't find out," which is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:Либо у нее будет Чаша, либо мы заставим ее сказать нам, где она находится. Она приведет с собой тех Сумеречных охотников. Они не пройдут через парадную дверь. Даже если пройдут, мы значительно превосходим их в числе.(Note: the correct translation is the first option provided)
The correct Russian translation is: [Люди немного не понимают справедливость. Справедливость должна быть абсолютна. Я надеялся, ты увидишь правосудие так, как его видела твоя мать. Как вижу я.]This is because "the way I do" in the original sentence refers to "the way I see justice," and "the way I see justice" is translated as "как вижу я" in the given options. The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately translate this phrase.
The correct Russian translation is: [Благодаря агенту Витлоку на данный момент мало что можно сделать с первой проблемой. Вторая проблема, с другой стороны... Ты не убивал Рикки Моралеса. Мы просто должны найти того, кто сделал.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first part of the sentence expresses gratitude to Agent Whitlock for resolving the first problem, but the speaker indicates that there is little that can currently be done about it. The second part of the sentence addresses a different problem: the fact that the listener did not kill Ricky Morales, and that the speaker and listener need to find the person who did.None of the other translations accurately capture the intended meaning of the sentence. Some of the translations use words that are too strong (e.g., "who wanted" or "who thought") or that imply a different meaning (e.g., "who helped" or "who said"). Only the correct translation uses the word "сделал", which means "did" or "made", and which accurately conveys the sense that the speaker and listener need to find the person who committed the crime of killing Ricky Morales.
The correct Russian translation is: [Вот что мы делаем. Нужно проверить её личный компьютер. Нет, не нужно. Я уже сделал.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "That's just what we do" is translated as "Вот что мы делаем" and the phrase "We need to look into her personal computer" is translated as "Нужно проверить её личный компьютер". The phrase "No, we don't" is translated as "Нет, не нужно" and the phrase "Cause I already did" is translated as "Я уже сделал" which means "I already did it".None of the other translations accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Вы примете на себя удар, политический. Это альтернатива войне с Индией. Думаете, ваши люди предпочтут это? Да, думаю.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is saying that taking a political hit is preferable to going to war with India, and when asked if they think their people would prefer war, they respond that they believe their people would prefer it. The other translations include incorrect verbs or phrases that don't accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [И когда ты станешь собой, и мы будем залиты кровью, я хочу править тьмой с тобой. А что если я не хочу никого "со мной"? Ты знаешь, что хочешь.]This translation is the most accurate because it reflects the intended meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "I want to rule the darkness at your side" is translated correctly as "я хочу править тьмой с тобой." The phrase "What if I don't want anyone at my side?" is translated as "А что если я не хочу никого 'со мной'?", which accurately captures the nuance of the English phrase. Finally, the phrase "You know you do" is translated as "Ты знаешь, что хочешь," which conveys the same sense of assurance and conviction as the original English phrase.The other options have various errors in their translations, such as using the wrong verb form, using an incorrect word choice, or failing to convey the intended meaning of the original sentence. Therefore, they are not correct translations of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Мы никого не просили это делать. Это кто-то из вашей работы? Вы просили кого-то это сделать? Подождите, нет, нет, не просил.]Out of the options given, this translation is not an exact match to any of them. Here's why:    Option 1: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "забрать" which means "to pick up" or "to take away," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 2: This translation is also mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "делал" which means "did" or "made," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 3: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "хотел" which means "wanted," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 4: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "думал" which means "thought," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 5: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "занимался" which means "was engaged in" or "was occupied with," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 6: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "знал" which means "knew," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 7: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "мог" which means "could," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 8: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "поступал" which means "acted," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 9: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "помогал" which means "helped," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 10: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "понимал" which means "understood," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.    Option 11: This translation is mostly accurate, but it uses the verb "говорил" which means "said," and it doesn't fit with the context of the original sentence.Therefore, the correct translation is option that is not listed, [Мы никого не просили это делать. Это кто-то из вашей работы? Вы просили кого-то это сделать? Подождите, нет, нет, не просил.].
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Нет. Я научу тебя, как играть в пейнтбол. Будто сам знаешь. О да, я знаю."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is expressing confidence in their knowledge of how to play paintball and is offering to teach the other person. The phrase "like you know" is being used sarcastically, implying that the other person doesn't actually know much about paintball. The response "Yeah, I do" reinforces the speaker's confidence in their own knowledge.
The correct Russian translation is: [Нужно поинтересоваться этим вопросом. Я вел к тому, что ты бы использовал свою рабочую руку. Так зачем Альварезу стрелять в себя с правой руки, если он был левшой? Может, он и не стрелял.].This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The word "стрелять" (strel'yat') means "to shoot" and is the correct verb to use in this context. The other options presented in the answer choices do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "делать" (delat') means "to do" and "хотеть" (khotet') means "to want," neither of which fit in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Они убили моих родителей. Заполонили город, который я клялся защищать. Этот ребенок никакого отношения к этому не имеет. Конечно, имеет.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The key phrases "murdered my parents" and "invaded the city" are translated correctly, and the phrase "sworn to protect" is translated as "который я клялся защищать," which means "which I swore to protect." The phrase "that kid's got nothing to do with all that" is translated as "Этот ребенок никакого отношения к этому не имеет," which means "this child has nothing to do with this," and the response "Of course he does" is translated as "Конечно, имеет," which means "Of course he does."The other translations provided include incorrect verbs or phrases that do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is:[Прошу тебя. Я видела в лесу мёртвых одичалых. Убиваете их ради забавы? Если не убивать, они перебьют нас.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided have minor differences in wording or phrasing, but they do not accurately capture the intended meaning of the sentence.For example, the second option, "Если не делать," translates to "If we don't do it," which changes the meaning from "If we don't kill them" to a more general "If we don't take action." Similarly, the third option, "Если не хотеть," translates to "If we don't want to," which again changes the meaning from "If we don't kill them" to a more general "If we don't have the desire to do something."In summary, the correct translation is the one that accurately captures the intended meaning of the original sentence, and in this case, it is the first option provided.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: ["Похоже". Доказательства более чем убедительные. Сол считает их наглядными. Мистер Беренсон так считает.]This is because "calls it conclusive" can be accurately translated to "считает их наглядными" in Russian, which means "considers them to be conclusive." The other options provided are not accurate translations of this phrase and do not convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Стоит признаться, это не сложно. Ты куда-то идешь? Да, ты помнишь Фиону Хелброн? Помню.].This is because the original English sentence uses the verb "remember," which in Russian is "помнить" (pomnit'). None of the other options provided are appropriate translations for "remember."
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Хм, я тоже. Я просто... Мне так хотелось верить в то, что там есть кто-то, кто любит меня. И сейчас кто-то действительно любит.]This is because the verb "does" in the English sentence is translated as "любит" in Russian, which means "loves". The other options provided do not accurately capture the meaning of the original sentence. For example, "делает" means "does/makes", "хочет" means "wants", "думает" means "thinks", "занимается" means "is engaged in", "знает" means "knows", "может" means "can", "поступает" means "acts", "помогает" means "helps", "понимает" means "understands", and "говорит" means "speaks". None of these verbs convey the meaning of "loves" as intended in the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Нам нужно поместить дом в список в этом месяце. Договоримся на другой день. Не уверен, что нам обязательно присутствовать на каждом заседании. Я уверен."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. Specifically, it translates "We have to get the house listed this month" to "Нам нужно поместить дом в список в этом месяце," which means the same thing. It also translates "We'll reschedule" to "Договоримся на другой день," which conveys the same idea of rescheduling. Additionally, it translates "I don't know it's necessary for us to be at every deposition" to "Не уверен, что нам обязательно присутствовать на каждом заседании," which means the same thing, and "I do" to "Я уверен," which conveys the same idea of certainty.None of the other given Russian translations accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. Some use incorrect vocabulary or grammar, while others convey different meanings or shades of meaning.
The correct Russian translation is: [Что ж... даже не знаю что сказать. Я думал, блинчики будут особенным угощением, но... нам... это не обязательно. Если никто их не хочет. Нет, мы хотим.]This translation is the correct one because it accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about what to say, and is explaining that they thought the crepes would be a special treat but they do not have to have them if nobody wants them. However, the speaker then clarifies that they do want the crepes. The correct translation conveys the same meaning in Russian.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Почему я? Ты предупредила пришельцев о Кадмусе. - Ты хочешь помогать людям. - Помогаю.]This translates back to English as:[Why me? You warned the aliens about Cadmus. - You want to help people. - I help.]
The correct translation is: [Мне пора. Они ушли. Не думаю, что она дала тебе чек. Она дала.].
The correct Russian translation is: [И вы вдруг обнаруживаете, что она получает доступ к секретной информации с вашего ноутбука. Ну, когда вы это так описываете.. Хотите, чтобы мы поверили, что вы ничего об этом не знали? Да, потому что я правда не знал.].This is because the verb "to know" in English should be translated as знать in Russian, and this is the verb used in the correct translation. The other options use verbs such as делать (to do), хотеть (to want), думать (to think), заниматься (to be engaged in), мочь (to be able to), поступать (to act), помогать (to help), понимать (to understand), and говорить (to speak), which do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Я отдал "конторе" 30 лет жизни. И я был безупречно лоялен. Я действительно верил в это. И до сих пор верю."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The verb "верю" (believe) in the last sentence is the correct translation because the speaker is saying that they still believe in the company, even after giving it 30 years of their life and being unfailingly loyal. The other options do not accurately convey the same meaning.
The correct Russian translation is: "Я стал подозревать, когда у него появились деньги. Я знал, что здесь он столько не зарабатывает. Ты ничего мне об этом не говорил. Не говорил."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker became suspicious when the person in question had a lot of money, and the speaker knew that the person could not have earned that much working at their current job. The speaker also mentions that the listener did not tell them anything about this, and the listener confirms that they did not speak about it. The other options include different verbs, such as "did not do" or "did not know," which do not fit the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence "It's her first lead surgery. Come on. You remember your first time. Yeah, I do." is:"Это ее первая операция как главного врача. Да ладно. Ты же помнишь свой первый раз. Да, помню."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence. The word "lead" is translated as "главного", which means "main" or "chief" in Russian. The phrase "Come on" is translated as "Да ладно", which is an idiomatic expression used to encourage someone or to express disbelief. The phrase "You remember your first time" is translated as "Ты же помнишь свой первый раз", which means "You remember your first time". The phrase "Yeah, I do" is translated as "Да, помню", which means "Yes, I do remember".The other options include incorrect verb forms or inappropriate words for the context, so they are not the correct translations.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Мне так жаль. А если я скажу, что для тебя есть способ покинуть Подземный мир раз и навсегда? Я так и не закончил свои подвиги. И не смогу уйти, пока не закончу.]This is because the Russian translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence without any significant grammatical or semantic errors. The other options include incorrect verb forms or incorrect word choices that do not accurately reflect the meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Вам было 14, когда отец выдал вас за мужчину, старше вас на 40 лет. Не представляю, каково это. Отцы должны защищать своих дочерей. А ваш не защищал.].This is because the verb "protect" in the English sentence is translated to the Russian verb "защищать" which means "to protect". Out of all the options provided, only the first one uses the correct verb "защищать" in the correct form "не защищал" to match the past tense of "did not protect". The other options use incorrect forms of the verb such as "не делал" (did not do), "не хотел" (did not want), "не думал" (did not think), "не занимался" (did not engage in), "не знал" (did not know), "не мог" (could not), "не поступал" (did not act), "не помогал" (did not help), or "не понимал" (did not understand), which do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence "You ever play Dungeons Dragons, Blaine? I'm sorry. No. I did." is: "Никогда не играл в Dungeons Dragons, Блейн? Извините. Нет. Я играл."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence in Russian. The other options listed do not accurately translate the sentence, as they either use incorrect verb forms or convey a different meaning than the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Может быть. Но его действия стали более интенсивными и непредсказуемыми, с тех пор, как он убил свою мать на той лодке. Отлично, потому что я не хочу, чтобы он действовал привычным образом. А я хочу.]This is because the last sentence in the English sentence is "Well, I do, okay?" which indicates that the speaker wants him to stain his routine, despite what was said before. The correct Russian translation is "А я хочу," which means "And I want to." This is the only option that accurately conveys the speaker's desire to see the person's routine stained, as the other options either do not express a desire to act (e.g. "A я делаю," which means "And I do") or suggest a different motivation or action altogether (e.g. "A я думаю," which means "And I think," or "A я помогаю," which means "And I help").
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:"Ты чего творишь? Нельзя убивать Джонс. Ты опоздал. Уже сделала."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The translation means: "What are you doing? You can't kill Jones. You're too late. I already did."The other options provided do not accurately convey the meaning of the original English sentence. For example, "Уже захотела" means "Already wanted," which does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Similarly, "Уже узнала" means "Already found out," which is not relevant to the sentence.Therefore, the correct Russian translation is the one that accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which is "Ты чего творишь? Нельзя убивать Джонс. Ты опоздал. Уже сделала."
The correct translation is: [Нет, потому что он убийца. Он убил троих. Ты не знаешь, о чем говоришь. Вообще-то знаю.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is responding to someone who is arguing with them about a person who is a killer. The speaker asserts that the person in question is a killer because he has killed three people. The speaker then dismisses the other person's argument by saying "You don't know what you're talking about," and then asserts that they do know what they're talking about by saying "Actually, I do." The word "знаю" in the correct translation means "know" and accurately captures the speaker's claim to knowledge.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Я два года не разговаривал с отцом после этого. Ты считал, что это он виноват. Да. И все еще считаешь."This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker didn't speak to their father for two years because the person they're talking to held their father responsible for something. The person acknowledges that they did hold their father responsible and still do. The Russian translation accurately conveys this meaning by using the verb "считать" (to think/believe) to show that the person still believes the same thing.
The correct Russian translation is: [Мы друзья. Похоже, ОСОБЕННЫЕ друзья. Мечтай. Вот и мечтаю.].This translation captures the meaning of the original English sentence accurately. The speaker acknowledges that they are "special friends" with the other person, and when the other person says "You wish," the speaker responds with "kinda do," indicating that they do have feelings beyond just friendship. The translation uses the appropriate verb form "мечтаю" which means "I dream" to convey the speaker's desire for something more than friendship.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Вы хоть домой вчера уходили? Мия была убита пять недель назад. Значит, она не отправляла сообщения Джейсону. Да, не отправляла.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The other options provided have different verbs and verb forms that do not fit the context of the sentence. For example:    "Да, не делала" (No, she didn't do it) uses the verb "делать" (to do) which does not fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is referring specifically to not sending messages to Jason, not just any action.   "Да, не хотела" (No, she didn't want to) uses the verb "хотеть" (to want) which again does not fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is not referring to Mia's desires or intentions, but rather her actions.   "Да, не думала" (No, she didn't think) uses the verb "думать" (to think) which is not appropriate in this context. Mia's actions regarding sending messages to Jason are not related to her thoughts.   "Да, не занималась" (No, she wasn't busy with it) uses the verb "заниматься" (to be busy with) which does not fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is not referring to Mia being too busy to send messages to Jason, but rather to her not doing so at all.   "Да, не знала" (No, she didn't know) uses the verb "знать" (to know) which is not relevant in this context. The sentence is not referring to Mia's knowledge or lack thereof, but rather to her actions.   "Да, не могла" (No, she couldn't) uses the verb "мочь" (to be able to) which is not appropriate in this context. The sentence is not referring to Mia's ability or inability to send messages to Jason, but rather to her not doing so at all.   "Да, не поступала" (No, she didn't behave in that way) uses the verb "поступать" (to behave) which is not appropriate in this context. The sentence is not referring to Mia's behavior, but rather to her actions regarding sending messages to Jason.   "Да, не помогала" (No, she didn't help) uses the verb "помогать" (to help) which does not fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is not referring to Mia helping or not helping someone, but rather to her not sending messages to Jason.   "Да, не понимала" (No, she didn't understand) uses the verb "понимать" (to understand) which is not relevant in this context. The sentence is not referring to Mia's comprehension or lack thereof, but rather to her actions.   "Да, не говорила" (No, she didn't say) uses the verb "говорить" (to say) which does not fit the context of the sentence. The sentence is not referring to Mia speaking or not speaking, but rather to her not sending messages to Jason.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Он хочет, чтобы ты пришел сюда и предстал перед судом за свои грехи. Перед присяжными, которые меня ненавидят? Черт та с два я приду. Если не придешь, эта толпа будет охотиться за тобой."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence, which talks about someone wanting another person to come back and stand trial for their sins before a jury of people who hate the speaker the most. The speaker refuses to do so and warns that if the person doesn't come back, a mob will hunt them down.The other options provided are incorrect because they contain different Russian verbs that don't accurately reflect the meaning of the original English sentence. For example, options like "если не захочешь" (if you don't want to) and "если не сможешь" (if you can't) don't accurately convey the sense of the English sentence, which implies a threat of harm if the person doesn't comply. Only the correct translation accurately captures this sense of threat by using the verb "будет охотиться" (will hunt down).
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: [Спустя неделю, она была мертва. Ему стало скучно. Я не верю тебе. А я думаю, что веришь].This translation accurately reflects the original English sentence. The first sentence is translated as "Within a week, she was dead," which corresponds to the original English sentence. The second sentence is translated as "He'd grown bored," which accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The third sentence is translated as "I don't believe you," which is a faithful translation of the original sentence. The fourth sentence is translated as "I think you do," which is a reasonable and accurate translation of the original sentence.Overall, this translation is accurate and conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence.
The correct translation is: [- Получить удар в глаз? - Ага. Я не понимаю. Я знаю, что не понимаешь, Эйприл, и это моя вина.]This is because the phrase "I know you don't, April, and that's my fault" means that the speaker is taking responsibility for April's lack of understanding, and acknowledges that it is their fault. None of the other options convey this meaning accurately.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "У Боба Росса всё просто. Счастливые деревья, счастливые облака. Боб не рисовал психологически тревожных голых людей. А Винтон Миллер делал."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which is that Bob Ross made painting look easy and he did not paint psychologically disturbing naked people, while Winton Miller did. The word "делал" (made) in the last sentence accurately reflects the meaning that Winton Miller was the one who painted the psychologically disturbing naked people, which makes it the correct option. The other options do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: [Вы уже почти сделали. Мы водолазы, а не врачи. Мы даже не знаем, что именно делаем. Зато я знаю.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first part of the Russian sentence, "Вы уже почти сделали," means "You have almost done it," which corresponds to "You most certainly can" in the original English sentence. The second part of the Russian sentence, "Мы водолазы, а не врачи. Мы даже не знаем, что именно делаем," means "We are divers, not doctors. We don't even know what we're doing," which accurately reflects the original sentence.The final part of the Russian sentence, "Зато я знаю," means "But I do know," which accurately conveys the meaning of "But I do" in the original English sentence.None of the other options provided as translations accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Рано быть такими самоуверенными. Мы их ещё даже не слышали. Послушайте, удача с неба на голову не падает. Ещё как падает, г-н Шек.]This is because this translation best captures the meaning and tone of the original English sentence. The phrase "too cocky" in the first sentence is translated as "такими самоуверенными" which means "too confident". The phrase "lucky breaks don't just fall from the sky" in the second sentence is translated as "удача с неба на голову не падает" which means "luck doesn't just fall from the sky onto your head". Finally, the response "Oh, yes, they do, Mr. Scheck" in the third sentence is translated as "Ещё как падает, г-н Шек" which means "Oh yes, it does, Mr. Scheck". This translation captures the sarcastic and humorous tone of the original sentence. The other translations have different words that do not capture the intended meaning or tone of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [- Мисс Грант? - Ммм. Не знаю, разговаривали ли вы с Адамом... Разговаривала.]This translation means "Miss Grant? Mmm. I don't know if you've talked to Adam... I did." It is the correct translation because it accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence, both in terms of the words used and the context of the conversation.The other options provided in the question are incorrect because they use verbs that do not accurately reflect the meaning of the sentence. For example, "Делала" means "did" or "made," but in this context, the speaker is talking about talking to Adam, not doing something else. Similarly, "Хотела" means "wanted," but that is not what the speaker is trying to convey. The other options similarly do not accurately capture the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Конечно, если ты хочешь рассказать мне. Майкл Мур. Ну, знаешь, Майкл Мур, либерал. Знаю.].This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is responding to a question about whether they know who Michael Moore is, and they confirm that they do know him as a liberal. None of the other translations accurately convey this meaning, as they use different verbs and do not mention Michael Moore's political affiliation.
The correct Russian translation is: [Зачем ему было делать это? Он болен. Он думал, что демоническая кровь сделает его нерожденного ребенка сильным. И она сделала.]
The correct Russian translation is:[Мы можем быть напуганы. И страх делает нас бесжалостными. И мы обращаем наш страх на Низший мир, как это делал Валентин. И так же, как он... мы в конечном итоге начнем обращаться друг против друга.]The translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The sentence talks about how fear can make people cruel and turn them against others, just as Valentine did. The word "Downworlders" is translated as "Низший мир" which means "Lower world" or "Underworld" in English. The phrase "just as he did" is translated as "как это делал он", and the phrase "we will end up turning on each other" is translated as "мы в конечном итоге начнем обращаться друг против друга". The other options provided in the question contain various grammatical errors or inaccuracies in translating the original meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Она не говорила "помощь". Значит, ты тоже это услышал. Эй, Дельгадо, передай спасибо маме за мой новый скринсейвер. Сделаю, Паркер.]This is because "will do" is an idiomatic expression used to indicate that someone will take care of something or do as requested. However, in Russian, there is no equivalent idiom for "will do." Instead, the appropriate translation for "will do" would be "сделаю" which means "will do" or "I will do it."Therefore, the correct translation is "Сделаю, Паркер" which means "I will do it, Parker."
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Их тётя Амелия. Вы недавно потеряли мужа. Это верно? Потеряла."This translation means "Their Aunt Amelia. You recently lost your husband. Is that correct? I did."The other options provided do not make sense in the context of the given English sentence. For example:    "Сделала" means "did" or "made", but it does not fit in the context of the question about losing a husband.   "Захотела" means "wanted", but it does not fit in the context of the question about losing a husband.   "Подумала" means "thought", but it does not fit in the context of the question about losing a husband.   "Занялась" means "occupied oneself with", but it does not fit in the context of the question about losing a husband.   "Узнала" means "found out", but it does not fit in the context of the question about losing a husband.   "Смогла" means "was able to", but it does not fit in the context of the question about losing a husband.   "Поступила" means "entered" or "acted", but it does not fit in the context of the question about losing a husband.   "Помогла" means "helped", but it does not fit in the context of the question about losing a husband.   "Поняла" means "understood", but it does not fit in the context of the question about losing a husband.   "Сказала" means "said" or "told", but it does not fit in the context of the question about losing a husband.Therefore, the correct translation is "Их тётя Амелия. Вы недавно потеряли мужа. Это верно? Потеряла."
The correct Russian translation is: [Это Дэнверс. Можно с тобой поговорить? Я не знаю вас. Теперь знаешь.].This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is introducing themselves as Danvers and asking for a minute of the listener's time. The listener responds that they don't know the speaker, to which the speaker replies that now they do. The Russian translation accurately captures this exchange without adding or changing any meaning.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я была с Астрой в последние минуты ее жизни. Мы простили друг друга, мы выразили уважение к нашим кровным узам. - Она не хотела этого. - Конечно она хотела.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options provided do not accurately translate the sentence and may convey a different meaning altogether.For example, in the second option, "Конечно она делала" means "Of course she was doing," which does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Similarly, in the third option, "Конечно она думала" means "Of course she was thinking," which also does not fit in the context of the sentence. The other options similarly do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Да, нет. Я делал то, что просила Робинс... Нет, ты помог той женщине пережить самые страшные часы в её жизни. Я помог?]This is because the phrase "I did, didn't I?" in the original English sentence is a confirmation of the statement that the other person made ("No, you helped that woman through the scariest hours of her life."). The correct translation of "I did, didn't I?" in this context is "Я помог?" in Russian. None of the other options listed convey the same meaning as the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[- Нет. Я помню нашу последнюю ночь в Буэнос-Айресе. Ты включила мне эту песню. Помню.]This translation means "No. I remember our last night in Buenos Aires. You played me this song. I remember."This is the correct translation because "I did" in the original sentence refers to the action of playing the song, which in Russian is expressed by the verb "включила" (played). The correct translation of "I did" in this context is not "делаю" (doing), "хочу" (want), "думаю" (thinking), "занимаюсь" (occupying oneself), "знаю" (know), "могу" (can), "поступаю" (acting), "помогаю" (helping), or "говорю" (saying), but rather "помню" (remembering).
The correct Russian translation is: [Это откровение. А человек, которого вы подстрелили? Никогда не узнает, каково это. Но я знаю.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is saying that they have experienced something similar to what the person they are speaking to has done (shooting someone), and that the person they shot will never know what it feels like. The speaker, however, knows what it feels like and has had a revelation because of it. None of the other translations accurately convey this meaning.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Он установил в фургон бомбу? Ты сказала... "защитить Френни". И я сделал." This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence, which indicates that the speaker protected Franny as they were instructed to do so. The other options either use the wrong verb tense, do not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence, or use a verb that does not fit in the context of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [И уж точно она не будет работать журналистом. Ты испоганила ей жизнь. Я не хотела, чтобы всё зашло так далеко. Хотела.]This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is admitting that the situation has gone too far and caused harm to someone's life, but the other person is insisting that they knew what they were doing and intended for it to happen. The word "хотела" in the Russian translation translates to "wanted" in English, which accurately captures the sense of the speaker's admission that they did not mean for things to go this far.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Чудака, создавшего Марголема? Я слегка выкрутила ему руки или яйца, и он дал мне заклинание. Живо-глину тяжело достать, но Фогг совсем не защищает свой тайник, будто он хотел, чтобы я её стащила. Ну я и стащила.]
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Скоро выздоровеет. Признайся, тебе же понравилось работать с гигантским степлером? Мне немного понравилось им пользоваться. Всем нравится.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "Everybody does" in the original sentence means that everyone likes using the stapler, which is translated as "Всем нравится" in the correct Russian translation. None of the other options include this phrase, making them incorrect translations.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Она также сказала, что я должна спросить тебя... кто ты. Почему? Я не знаю. Я думаю, ты знаешь.]This is because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence in Russian. The other options have different verbs that do not fit the context, such as "делаешь" (do), "хочешь" (want), "думаешь" (think), "занимаешься" (engage in), "можешь" (can), "поступаешь" (act), "помогаешь" (help), "понимаешь" (understand), and "говоришь" (speak). These verbs do not match the meaning of the English sentence, which is about knowing the identity of the person being addressed.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Боже, Энди, я знаю! Я должна узнать, почему. Мне нужно знать, почему. А если ты этого не хочешь, я..." which translates back to English as "Christ, Andy, I know that! I have to know why. I need to know why. And if you don't, I..."This translation is correct because it accurately captures the meaning and tone of the original English sentence. The speaker is frustrated and insistent on getting an answer to their question, and the Russian translation conveys this tone and meaning effectively.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [Что с ней? Значит, ты слышал о ней? Я не говорил этого. Да, ты сказал.]. This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original sentence, which is a dialogue between two people where one person denies having said something and the other person contradicts them by saying "yeah, you did." The other options provided in the question either change the meaning of the original sentence or use incorrect grammar.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Сюда. Да они обосрутся. Слушай, было весело и все такое, но серьезно, Фостер, прекрати попытки меня убить. Я никогда не делал.]This is because the phrase "I never did" in the English sentence refers to the action of "trying to kill" the speaker. The correct translation of "I never did" in this context is "я никогда не делал" in Russian, which means "I never did" or "I never tried to." The other options provided, such as "я никогда не хотел" (I never wanted to) or "я никогда не знал" (I never knew), do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original English sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: [Голодный? Да, голодный. Твоя мама точно знает, что тебе нужно, не так ли? Да, знает.]This is because the subject of the sentence is singular and masculine, which in Russian is translated as "голодный" (hungry) and not "голодная" (hungry, feminine). Additionally, the correct translation for "Yes, you are" is "Да, голодный", and not "Конечно, голодная".In the second part of the sentence, the correct translation for "knows" is "знает", and not "делает", "хочет", "думает", "занимается", "может", "поступает", "помогает", "понимает", or "говорит". These are all different verbs with different meanings.
The correct Russian translation is: [Похоже, леди Арабелле не терпится загладить свою вину. - Как мне с ней говорить? - Можешь вообще с ней не встречаться. Ну нет, я встречусь.].This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker acknowledges that Lady Arabella is eager to make amends and wonders how to approach her. When advised not to see her at all, the speaker insists on meeting her anyway. The Russian translation captures the same sequence of events and the speaker's determination to face Lady Arabella despite the difficulties. None of the other options provide an accurate translation of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:Я Сара Скофилд. Спасибо, что уделил(а) время. Мой муж, Джейкоб Несс, случайно не просил тебя проверить мой телефон? Да, просил вчера.This translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The other options have different verb forms that do not fit the context of the sentence. For example, "делал" means "did" in the sense of "completed" or "made," which does not make sense in this context. Similarly, "хотел" means "wanted," but that does not convey the fact that Jacob Ness actually asked the person to work on Sara's cell phone. The other options also have verb forms that do not fit the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct option is the one that accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: "Ты работала у него. И когда он напивался, он становился совершенно другим человеком. Однажды я думала, что он меня убьет, но этого не произошло." None of the provided translations accurately captures the intended meaning of the English sentence.The correct translation conveys the following information:    The subject (you) worked for someone (him).   When he got drunk, he would change into a completely different person.   One time, the speaker (I) thought he was going to kill her, but he didn't.   The last sentence can be translated as "but it didn't happen" or "but he didn't."None of the provided translations accurately captures all of these aspects of the sentence. Many of the provided translations contain errors in verb tense, word choice, or syntax, making them grammatically incorrect or semantically unclear. Therefore, the correct translation is the one that accurately conveys the intended meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is: "Я думаю, нам нужно поговорить о Калебе. Калеб украл твои деньги и встречался с женщиной, которая передала ему это. Я думаю, они связаны, но не знаю как. Может, ты знаешь."This is because the correct translation accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence, while the other options either use the wrong verb form or do not convey the intended meaning.Option 2: "Может, ты делаешь" means "Maybe you are doing," which does not make sense in this context.Option 3: "Может, ты хочешь" means "Maybe you want," which is not appropriate in this context as the speaker is asking for help, not expressing a desire.Option 4: "Может, ты думаешь" means "Maybe you are thinking," which is close in meaning to the correct option but not exactly the same.Option 5: "Может, ты занимаешься" means "Maybe you are engaged in," which does not make sense in this context.Option 6: "Может, ты можешь" means "Maybe you can," which is close in meaning to the correct option but not exactly the same.Option 7: "Может, ты поступаешь" means "Maybe you are acting," which does not make sense in this context.Option 8: "Может, ты помогаешь" means "Maybe you are helping," which is close in meaning to the correct option but not exactly the same.Option 9: "Может, ты понимаешь" means "Maybe you understand," which is close in meaning to the correct option but not exactly the same.Option 10: "Может, ты говоришь" means "Maybe you are speaking," which does not make sense in this context.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Я здесь, чтобы вернуть Эмму. Ну что ж, удачи с этим. Ты не сможешь завладеть лампой. Но даже если сделаешь, желания ты не загадаешь.]This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The other options contain variations in the verb form that change the meaning of the sentence. For example, the second option has the word "сделаешь," which means "make" instead of "did" or "undo" as in the original sentence. The other options have similar variations that make them incorrect translations.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Если проект пройдет, строительство будет длиться год. Здесь будет очень шумно. Я не знаю, но могу позвонить в агентство. Да, позвоните.]This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The first sentence translates to "If the project goes ahead, the construction will last for a year," which captures the conditional nature of the statement. The second sentence translates to "It will be very noisy here," which is an accurate description of the situation being discussed. The third sentence translates to "I don't know, but I can call the agency," which is an accurate translation of the original sentence. Finally, the last sentence translates to "Yes, please do," which is an accurate and natural way of responding to the offer to call the agency.
The correct translation is: "Прости, что? Джош? Ты вызвал копов? Конечно вызвал!"This translation accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence. The speaker is apologizing and then asking Josh if he called the cops. Josh confirms that he did, so "Конечно вызвал!" (which means "Of course I did.") is the appropriate response.
The correct Russian translation is:[Привези Дариуса в поместье и я откажусь от вечерних нарядов. Устрою тебе бассейн и бикини. И пусть победит сильнейший мужчина. Она всегда делает.]This is because the verb "does" in the original English sentence refers to the subject "she" always winning, which is an action or behavior that "she" performs. The correct translation for this action or behavior in Russian is "делает" which means "does" or "performs." The other options presented in the answer choices have different verbs that do not accurately capture the meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Нет. Колледж был просто не для меня. Луис был как кость в горле, но я считала его безобидным. Марисса тоже так думала, наверно, пока он её не убил.]This is because the verb "thought" in the original English sentence should be translated as "думала" in Russian. The other options provided use verbs like "делала" (did), "хотела" (wanted), "занималась" (engaged in), "знала" (knew), "могла" (could), "поступала" (acted), "помогала" (helped), "понимала" (understood), or "говорила" (said), which do not accurately convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Вы наняли людей, чтобы следить за мной? Снимать видео? Нет, это не было первоначальным намерением. Но мы это сделали.]Out of the options provided, none of them match the correct translation. The correct translation conveys the meaning of the English sentence accurately and idiomatically, using the appropriate verbs and tenses to reflect the intended meaning.The provided options either use incorrect verbs, incorrect tenses, or convey a different meaning altogether. Therefore, the correct translation cannot be selected from the given options.
The correct translation is: [Но это не конец. Я верну своё королевство. И пусть победит сильнейший мужчина. Она всегда побеждает.]This is because "May the best man win" is an idiom that means "let the most competent person win," and "She usually does" is a response to the previous statement indicating that the speaker is confident in their ability to win. The correct translation accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence, while the other options provide inaccurate or nonsensical translations.
The correct Russian translation is: "Шеф-повар. Это же работа твоей мечты. Я всё понимаю. Нет, не понимаешь."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the English sentence. The first two sentences establish that the job of an executive chef is the listener's dream job, and the speaker expresses understanding of this fact. However, the listener responds with "No, I don't think you do," which suggests that the speaker may not fully understand why the job is so important to the listener. The chosen translation correctly translates this exchange into Russian.
The correct Russian translation of the English sentence is: "Иногда просто... живешь, чтобы сожалеть. Ты не знаешь, о чем говоришь. Да, может и не знаю. Обычно не знаю, так что..." This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is admitting that they may not know what they are talking about and often regret their decisions. The other translations use words and phrases that do not fit the context or convey the same meaning, such as "не делаю" (don't do), "не хочу" (don't want), "не думаю" (don't think), and so on.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[Мне надо поговорить с Арамом. Ты знаешь, где проходит "Чёрная Месса"? Это срочно, Лиззи. Потому что мы не знаем, а он там.]This is because the sentence translates to: "I need to speak with Aram. Do you know where they're holding Black Mass? It's urgent, Lizzy. Because we don't, and that's where he is."The other options provided have different meanings or incorrect grammar. For example, "мы не делаем" means "we don't do" instead of "we don't know," and "мы не говорим" means "we don't speak" instead of "we don't know." Therefore, only the first option accurately conveys the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: ["Полиция". Леонард Милвуд здесь? Он говорит с вами. Мне не нужно говорить с вами. Да, вам действительно нужно].None of the provided options accurately capture the meaning of the English sentence. The correct translation conveys that someone is identifying themselves as the police and asking if Leonard Milwood is present. The person being addressed tries to avoid speaking to the police, but the police insist that they need to talk to them.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[В палате рядом врачи отключали систему жизнеобеспечения у моей шестилетней дочери. И эта женщина сказала "призрачная красота". Люди не знают, что говорить в такие моменты. Но она знала.]The correct translation is the first option provided in the question. This is because it accurately reflects the meaning of the English sentence and maintains the correct tense and subject-verb agreement. The translation correctly uses the past tense verb form "отключали" to indicate that the doctors were in the process of turning off life support, and the possessive form "мою" to show that it was the speaker's daughter. It also accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "collateral beauty" as "призрачная красота," which carries the connotation of beauty that is fleeting or illusory.The other options contain errors such as incorrect verb tense or incorrect subject-verb agreement, and some use verbs that do not accurately reflect the intended meaning of the English sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Подумать только, я собирался отказаться от переезда в Толидо со своей семьей ради тебя. Что? Когда мы ходили в трейлер к моему папе, ты спросила меня, верю ли я ему. Я сказал, что верю.]This is because "я сказал, что верю" translates to "I said I did believe," which accurately reflects the past tense of the English sentence. The other options either use the wrong verb tense or completely change the meaning of the sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Они встретились с тобой только ради финального вложения денег, прежде чем они исчезнут навсегда. Калеб слишком боялся тебе говорить. Калеб так сказал? Да, конечно, сказал.]This is the correct translation because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The sentence states that "They only met up with you for one final cash infusion before disappearing for good," and that "Caleb was too afraid to tell you." When asked if Caleb said something, the response is "Yeah, of course he did." The chosen translation accurately captures the meaning of these statements without introducing any errors or changing the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is: [А.Н.Б-шница упертая, помнишь? Не, не, не, не, не. Если один из моих помощников разговаривал с АНБ, ты обязана меня проинформировать. Анна не говорила.].This translation is correct because it accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The phrase "NSA hard-ass, remember?" is translated to "А.Н.Б-шница упертая, помнишь?", which conveys the same sense of a strict, uncompromising organization. The phrase "If one of my associates talked to the NSA out of school, you have the obligation to inform me" is translated to "Если один из моих помощников разговаривал с АНБ, ты обязана меня проинформировать", which conveys the same sense of an obligation to report any inappropriate communication. Finally, the phrase "Anna didn't" is translated to "Анна не говорила", which accurately conveys the sense that Anna did not communicate with the NSA.
The correct Russian translation for the given English sentence is:[С чем? С этого момента вы повышены до директора программы Сшивателей. Не уверена, что хочу эту должность. Конечно хотите.]This translation is correct because it accurately captures the meaning of the English sentence. The phrase "effective immediately" is translated as "с этого момента" which means "from this moment". The phrase "you're promoted" is translated as "вы повышены" which means "you are promoted". The phrase "acting director" is translated as "директора программы" which means "director of the program". The word "Stitchers" is translated as "Сшивателей" which means "Stitchers" in Russian. The phrase "not sure I want the job" is translated as "не уверена, что хочу эту должность" which means "not sure I want this position". Finally, the phrase "sure you do" is translated as "конечно хотите" which means "of course you want (it)".
The correct translation is: "Не надо. Не уходи. Сдуру я поверила, что всё изменилось. Думала, что ты тоже изменился."This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence, which is a plea for someone not to leave because the speaker had mistakenly believed that things had changed between them. The phrase "I think you did, too" suggests that the other person may have also had false hopes about the situation, which is conveyed in the Russian translation with the phrase "Думала, что ты тоже изменился" (I thought that you had also changed). The other translations have either incorrect verb forms, incorrect verb tense or incorrect word choice that deviate from the intended meaning.
The correct Russian translation is: "Могу я войти? Очень неожиданно. Ты же говорила, что больше не хочешь ужинать в доме. А сегодня хочу."This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is asking for permission to enter and expressing surprise that the other person is at home. They mention that the other person has said they don't want to eat at home, but tonight the speaker wants to eat there. The other translations either use incorrect verb forms or convey a different meaning than the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation is: [Иди сюда, чертов красавец. Выглядишь отлично! - Вы знаете Джо Манфреди? - Да, знаем.].This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. The speaker is addressing someone as a handsome son of a bitch and a glorious kook, and then asks if they know Joe Manfredi. The use of "знаем" (know) in the response indicates that the speaker is familiar with Joe Manfredi. The other options use words and phrases that do not fit the context or convey the intended meaning of the original sentence.
The correct Russian translation of the given English sentence is:[Оборонной конторой, на которую я работал. Нам сказали, что продление срока задержания заключенных, которые отказались предоставить развед.данные, жизненно необходимо для войны с террором. И как ты спишь ночью? Я не сплю.]This translation accurately captures the meaning of the original English sentence. The subject of the sentence is talking about their former employer, a defense firm, and how they were instructed to help keep detainees in confinement for a longer period of time if they refused to provide intelligence information that was deemed vital to the War on Terror. The final sentence is a response to the question, "And how do you sleep at night?" which the subject answers with "I didn't", meaning they were unable to sleep due to the nature of their work.Out of all the options provided, only one accurately translates the original meaning.
